Part I

MATT: So, where we left off, our intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, having returned the traitor Riskel Daxio to Sovereign Uriel in the center of the town of Emon, Grog beheading him as part of his punishment for being such a traitorous worshiper of the evil entity known as Vecna. Upon going out for a pub crawl, came across Gilmore in a secret speakeasy, managed to enjoy a Heroes' Feast at his expense, whereas Vex and Vax both, all of you, got pretty– Keyleth got very– drunk.

LAURA: I didn't get drunk at all.

MATT: That's right, you didn't drink.

MARISHA: I got pretty wasted.

MATT: Gilmore had a very intense conversation with Vax over there to ensure where they stood, and Keyleth vomited multiple times. But after which the party found their way back to the Keep, where Dr. Dranzel and his Spectacular Traveling Troupe were drinking and expecting you to be there, in which they could converse and try and convince you of a little caper they've been trying to get their head around for a while, and you seem to have the entry to this possible windfall of money. Scanlan, after courting this young, pixie-haired gnome–

SAM: I sort of knew in the back of my head, right? No, I was courting her. No, it's true.

(laughter)

MATT: Was instead confronted in his bedroom by Kaylie, who revealed herself to be Scanlan's long-unknown daughter from many years ago, who had trained very hard as a bard at the College of the White Duke, in Westruun, and honed her skills with a blade with the intent of finding you one day and disgracing you. Thanks to Scanlan's sudden realization, change of heart, and attempt to connect with his lost blood, broke a bit of that cold honed exterior, and managed to prevent a very dangerous and possibly deadly encounter. She left frustrated and confused, and hasn't been seen since. The rest of you, gathering the next morning, discussed this endeavor with Dr. Dranzel and how they had found a home that had been long abandoned after being purchased by a collector. A home that you guys had ransacked a little over a year before after finding a portal within that led to a dragon's hoard, as the previous person who lived there, General Krieg, was actually a dragon who had infiltrated the Council.

LAURA: A really hot dragon. I remember thinking he was really cute. I had a thing for General Krieg. I was really sad when it turned out he was–

MATT: I'm sorry it worked out that way.

LIAM: That dragon had a lot of bling, too, if I remember.

MATT: Yeah, that was Grog's famous rage looting. General Krieg, Bonescythe– Brimscythe, sorry. They're close. Brimscythe the Dragon was slaughtered in this endeavor, however it's been over a year since. You guys returned to this house, scoured it, found your way through the still existing secret passage that led you to the now partially collapsed cavern, which once housed Brimscythe and his hoard. You found that the tunnel itself, freezing cold, the rubble of the partially collapsed cavern had been ravaged by some sort of large clawed entity that Vex had identified as another equally dangerous dragon that seems to have rummaged through and found the corpse of Brimscythe. You also found that a number of gold coins, a bit of his hoard that had been buried in this, were now exposed by these strange, smooth tunnels that were carved into the rock. Upon you, Scanlan, and Trinket inquiring there, the rest of the party scattered. Pike and Keyleth went to find what seemed to be the owner of the house, now frozen in fright in a far alcove. And the three, the rest of your group, traveling towards the mouth of the cavern itself, before the ground begins to rumble. Suddenly, exploding from the rock and shale of the bottom of the cavern floor, you guys managed to see before you, piercing forth from the ground itself, a very, very large, segmented, armored, worm-like entity.

SAM: Armored?

MATT: The actual hide itself is like very, very thick.

LAURA: Super thick? Ugh!

SAM: Like with armor?

MATT: Not with armor, just this natural sense.

LAURA: When we kill it, we can make armor out of him.

LIAM: And it was pale and icy, too, I think you were describing?

MATT: It was darkish purple in its color and tint, like dark blacks, purple, with rows and rows of teeth coming out of its eyeless face. As it bursts out of the surface, I need you all to roll initiative.

LAURA: No!

SAM: Oh my god, right away, right away. We're just in it. Just like that.

TRAVIS: Fuck yeah!

MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20?

TRAVIS: 20, to kill Scanlan.

(laughter)

MATT: 20 to 15?

MARISHA: 19.

SAM: That's it?

LIAM: 15.

MATT: 15 to ten?

TALIESIN: Ten.

SAM: 11.

MATT: All right, then comes ten to five?

LAURA: Nine.

MATT: And Pike, while, as she's not here, rolled the lowest. Ashley, unfortunately, due to scheduling, could not be here this evening. So far, we're hoping she might show up at some point tonight, we'll find out. But, in the meantime, I'm going to be running Pike on my end. So, starting the encounter, as you see this giant worm creature through the tunnel, the three of you now walking the other direction, you, feeling the rumble, turn around, holding forth your greatsword unsheathed, you can feel the power pulsing with each beat of your blood through your body, as a little voice in the back of your head, stemming from your weapon, goes, “Kill.” You're up, Grog.

TRAVIS: Well, I hope you're hungry. But you have to wait one second, we're a bit far away. Can I travel as far as I can towards?

MATT: Speed of 50, I believe?

TRAVIS: 50.

LAURA: Oh, I said I hid at the end of the episode. I said I hid.

MATT: Right, roll stealth.

TRAVIS: Do I have a line of sight with him, or is the edge of that outcropping blocking it?

MATT: He would have half cover if you were to try and like, throw your weapon at him. It'd be a plus five to his armor class.

MARISHA: Pike and I are hiding, too.

MATT: Okay, stealth check for both of you.

TRAVIS: Could I back up three squares, so that I could move to my left so I could get a straight look at him?

MATT: There, you mean?

TRAVIS: Can I go one more?

MATT: That's the extent of your movement right there, unfortunately. Unless you want to go at this angle, there. There you go.

TRAVIS: Can I use the Javelin of Lightning?

SAM: What the fuck is that? That's a thing you made up.

TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I've got it. I utter the magic word “Penelope” and I throw it and each creature in the line, excluding me and the target, must make a DC 13 dexterity saving throw.

MATT: Okay, there are no creatures in the line, just the target.

TRAVIS: Just the target then.

LIAM: Did you get that in Yug'Voril?

TRAVIS: Huh?

LIAM: Yug'Voril. Is it from Yug'Voril?

TRAVIS: I don't remember, it's just in the bag.

LIAM: In Yug'Voril, at the bottom of that pit, when he headbutted the giant.

MATT: Yup, that was in the rubble.

LIAM: Yeah! Ding!

MATT: Good memory!

TRAVIS: Can I try and throw it?

MATT: You may, go for it.

TRAVIS: 18.

MATT: 18 total? 18 just hits. So, go ahead and roll damage for the javelin. As you rear back, aim it with your eyes, and the frustration is palpable from Craven Edge as you put it aside to throw the javelin instead as it arcs into a bolt of energy that streaks forth, slams into the hide of the giant purple worm. Go ahead and roll damage.

TRAVIS: 19.

MATT: 19. All righty. Great. It rears in place, shakes itself for a second. It has no eyes, so it's not looking in any different direction, it just seems to be flailing in its current location.

TRAVIS: Can I go into a rage?

MATT: Yes you may.

TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

MATT: All right. (laughs)

LAURA: Are you rolling your special dice?

MATT: As you bite your lower lip, you feel and taste the blood begin to enter your mouth, and at that point the heat in the back of your shoulders and neck begins to swell up. Grog's into a rage. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Can I do, like, a nature check on this thing to see if I can discern any type of information on it?

MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

MARISHA: Just straight intelligence? That's not good. I think that is a five? Six! Six!

MATT: Six. You have no recollection of this type of an entity in your travels. It's definitely not natural, it's not of nature, and you've seen various types of eyeless worm-type creatures, but nowhere near on this scale. So, yeah. You have no idea beyond that.

MARISHA: I'm just going to whisper to Pike, and be like: It doesn't have any eyes! I feel like we shouldn't move!

MATT: She goes, “Okay!” And she gets as still as she possibly can. “It's good! Moving's not my forte.”

MARISHA: Okay! I, like, hold her shoulder pads so she doesn't clink any.

MATT: “Okay!”

MARISHA: Okay! I'm going to stay right here!

MATT: All right. So that ends your turn. Vax, you're up. Unless you want to do something else on your turn, is that it?

MARISHA: I'm just, I'm just going to, I don't want to move. I'm just going to wait.

SAM: (mocking) I don't want to, I don't want to move!

MARISHA: I don't want to move!

LIAM: Click the Boots of Haste, and I want to go stealth, and scoot to that column past Grog, but closer to the worm. Not that one, the next one. Yeah. I think I can make it there.

MATT: All right. You can get there.

LIAM: Do I need to roll stealth?

MATT: You can roll stealth, yeah.

LIAM: I want to throw a dagger at it. Yeah. That is 28.

MATT: All right. That definitely hits. However, it is not sneak attack damage. You are hiding definitely behind the pillar, but your footsteps. And you get the essence as soon as you see the creature, its head follows you across the room, you get the sense immediately that it is not a sight-based creature, it is definitely a movement-based creature, and its head just follows you as you move.

LIAM: I'll defer, but let me ask, going stealth and rolling a 28 on stealth, the footsteps were still enough to alert it to where I was?

MATT: Is it a natural 20?

LIAM: I didn't attack yet. No, it was a combined 28, just to go stealth.

MATT: A combined 28. Right, even so, not quite light enough. Not with the knowledge that it was an issue with this entity, and due to the proximity of it, and it being a very sensitive creature to the rock's movement, it still picks you up.

LIAM: And I should have one attack. I should have an attack, right? Because I did the boots, I ran over here–

MATT: Yep, so you have an attack.

LIAM: Two.

MATT: Well, two attacks, you have offhand, so yeah.

LIAM: Two, yeah. Two, because it was double the speed because of the boots. All right. First one is shit. That is 14. And the second one is– I'm going to do Luck on that. The second one is 20.

MATT: The second one hits. The first one unfortunately just bounces off of its hide.

LIAM: That's not a lot. But it is seven points of damage.

MATT: Seven points of damage, got it.

LIAM: First blood. First blood, everyone.

SAM: It's looking pretty beat up.

MATT: All right. At this point in time, the dagger embeds itself in. You see the hilt sinks into the hide and then vanishes in a puff of smoke as it returns to your belt, however you can see a little bit of black liquid pouring forth from it, and its head has been trained on you since you moved across the room. The worm now disappears beneath the ground.

TALIESIN: Not cool.

MATT: And you feel the ground beneath you begin to shake, as it bursts out of the ground. That's a 20 to hit.

LIAM: 20? Can I use Evasion or no?

MATT: To reduce the damage in half if you want. Huh? What's your AC?

LIAM: Oh, with the boots on, 18.

MATT: It rolled a 20.

LIAM: Yeah, I know. So tell me what happens.

MATT: So, as you look around you all of a sudden the jaws start coming up out of the ground behind you, the teeth biting into your body as you try and wrest yourself away from its grip. You take 20 points of piercing damage.

LIAM: Oh, well, Uncanny Dodge. Right? Evasion is for spell effects–

MATT: Right, Evasion does not help you in this circumstance, Uncanny Dodge allows you to reduce the damage by half. So yes, you can do that. So you take ten damage instead. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

LIAM: That's okay. All right, so. Okay. Natural 20!

MATT: As the jaws attempt to clamp around you, you manage to just pull yourself away, tearing your knees across the teeth, but rolling in the opposite direction, right in the place where you were as it bursts out of the ground just beside you and rights itself around in that direction. As its full body emerges now, you can see its tail flop out of the tunnel it just made with this giant hooked stinger on the end as it whips off in your direction. That is going to be a 15 to hit.

TRAVIS: That'll miss.

MATT: That misses you. As the stinger swings towards you, you manage to just duck out of the way, your eyes trained on it in an absolute red fury, and it just whiffs past your face.

SAM: Could've been bad, could've been bad.

MATT: That ends its turn. Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Who's in front of me?

MATT: Right now you're next to Trinket and Vex is behind you.

LAURA: (laughing) Don't be a dick!

SAM: I'm not going to be a dick. I brush past Trinket so I can see the worm.

MATT: Okay, about there, you can see it from that perspective.

SAM: Okay I hold up my cone, my Hand Cone of Clarity, and I will cast Eyebite. Singing to it (singing) Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Making you very sick. Ooh, Scanlan's eyes are biting you. Scanlan's eyes! All right, so the Eyebite refers to my eyes. He doesn't need eyes. He doesn't need to be able to see me, I have to be able to see him, right? It works. Okay, so I'm going to do Sicken.

MATT: To sicken it? All right. All right, it rolls, this is a wisdom saving throw? It rolls an eight. So yeah, it does not succeed on that. Eyebite takes hold. Get this little marker on there, on its neck, like a little– There we go. So as your spell completes on it, you can see its form contracts for a second and its head hangs a little less strong as it did previously. It almost goes slack for a moment from the impact of the spell affecting its physical form. All right, so it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, for as long as it lasts. All right, so that's your movement, that's your action, any bonus actions?

SAM: I will inspire Vex. With a limerick.

LAURA: I can't wait.

SAM: I once knew a bear named Trinket, and would often tell you he stink-et, but you were appalled, so you kicked me in the balls, and now I don't say it, I just think it.

(laughter)

LAURA: That was wonderful!

MATT: A d10 inspiration die to you, Vex.

LAURA: Yay!

LIAM: Plus or minus?

MATT: (laughs) We'll see.

MARISHA: Am I able to take a bonus action to like shout something out over comms?

MATT: I'll allow it, since you held your turn this turn anyways, yeah.

MARISHA: Yeah? Everyone should try and get a little bit so I can see you. And I can make us all fly.

LAURA: (shouting) What? You can make us fly?

MARISHA: I learned it today. But you have to be within 30 feet of me.

LAURA: Oh, really, but I'm so far away from you.

MARISHA: You know, imagine I said it more succinctly than this.

MATT: (laughs) That's as much as you can get out. Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to head in the direction of the message I just received. So I'm going to crawl around the bottom there.

LAURA: Ugh, I'm not going to be able to get to her.

MATT: That's as far as you can get.

TALIESIN: That's as far as I can get, that's fine. I'm going to take a couple shots, with the big gun. I'm going to Bad News this. So, let's take a shot at that guy. Yeah, that's reasonable range. Yeah, okay. Not too close. That's not bad, 21.

MATT: 21 hits.

TALIESIN: 28 points of damage.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Quick reload, going to get one more shot off and I'm going to take this one with the sharpshooter effect just to see how things go.

MATT: Sure. The sharpshooter effect, you mean the deadeye?

TALIESIN: Yep. Yeah, the deadeye. The negative five to hit.

MATT: Oh, got you, got you, all right.

TALIESIN: 14.

MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you load the second round, you pull Bad News in front of you and you go to fire, the ground actually shakes beneath you. There's a quaking. Not sure if it's from the creature or just the atmosphere around you, but as you do the gun just misfires and, well, it actually doesn't misfire, but it fires off into one of the side elements of the cave and you hear it ricochet off the rock.

TALIESIN: That's what I got.

MATT: All right, that's 28 damage, 28 damage is not bad.

All right, Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Okay. Will you be able to move forward?

MARISHA: Yeah.

LAURA: Okay. I'm going to send Trinket up to that little alcove. Keep running, no, a little further– a little further.

MATT: That's– what's Trinket's movement? Is it 40? So he can go there.

LAURA: That's as close as he can get to you.

MATT: Six, actually seven, eight. So that'd be the full movement.

LAURA: Okay. Get him tucked into that little side.

MATT: Trinket is now stepping onto a bit of slick of ice and is like (unbalanced bear noises) but seems to be okay at the moment.

LAURA: Okay. And then I move forward so I can see him. Right there. All right. And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him! And then I'm going to shoot my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel at him. So that, I'm going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three arrows and they all turn into storm arrows. So I roll an attack for each one of those for my first attack.

MATT: Correct. Yep. Yep. As you release the arrow from the actual tension of the bow, as soon as it leaves your fingers it almost burns the tips as it races into this arrow of pure energy. As it divides in the middle of the air, you can see each arrow sparking off bits of electrical power on its–

LAURA: Okay, so the first one is a 26.

MATT: Hits.

LAURA: Should I roll damage for that one?

MATT: Roll to see how many hit.

LAURA: The second one is a 29.

MATT: Hits.

LAURA: The third one is a 20.

MATT: 20 hits. Yeah, all three hit.

LIAM: This is all happening in less than six seconds.

LAURA: 17– 20. 23 for the first arrow.

MATT: All righty.

LAURA: Nine, ten, 11, 13. 17 for the second one. And then 14, 15, 16…

SAM: I feel bad for this thing.

LAURA: 22. 20, what is that? 27 for the third.

MATT: Oof, all right. As each arrow slams into its side, you can see portions of its large chitinous, almost like armored shell crack and break open. And you can see now these streams of black worm blood are spilling down its side. And it starts shaking in place now in pain.

LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring for my second attack.

MATT: All right.

SAM: Second attack?

LAURA: Yeah, that was just one.

MATT: Yeah, she gets that once a day.

LAURA: 25.

MATT: 25 hits.

TRAVIS: You have more dice than that dice store.

LAURA: I know, it's ridiculous. 16– 16– 19, and then an additional d10. So 19 of fire damage. So 25 for the third.

MATT: 25. Oof. That is a nasty round. Well done.

LAURA: For the fourth arrow.

MATT: As this fourth arrow slams into its side there's a burst of fire from the impact and you can see it now. It's starting to shriek this horrible high-pitched multi-toned scream. All right, that ends your turn.

LAURA: And I rolled a 15 for stealth, not that it probably matters anymore.

MATT: Nah, no, it doesn't really. All right.

LAURA: And then I stay very, very still.

MATT: Cool, so does Pike. Pike's going to follow in Keyleth's order and spend the round just keeping in place, very quietly. All right, top of the round again. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: Oh, are we flying?

ALL: No.

TRAVIS: Fuck it! I take Craven Edge out. I hope you're hungry. And I would like to go into a frenzied rage.

MATT: All right.

TRAVIS: And I would like to attack, the first two times, at the big purple dick that just came out of the ground.

MATT: All right.

MARISHA: Hey, move down a bit so you're not in my way.

TRAVIS: Which way?

MATT: Grog's just charging in.

TRAVIS: That's a 23?

MATT: 23 hits.

TRAVIS: 20?

MATT: 20 hits.

TRAVIS: Wow. 26?

MATT: All three hit. These are non-Great Weapon Master, right?

TRAVIS: The third one I wanted it to be, should I reroll since I didn't specify?

MATT: Reroll because you didn't say it, yeah.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: That misses, unfortunately. But the first two do hit. Yeah, you got to mention that before you make the attack.

TRAVIS: I do, I do. You're right. 2d6. What do sixes look like? They're squares.

LAURA: They're squares.

(laughter)

SAM: Cubes, really.

TRAVIS: Jeez, three, eight, 16 for the first one.

MATT: All righty.

TRAVIS: And 16 for the second one.

MATT: All righty. What's the DC on the sword effect, again? Is it 12?

TRAVIS: Oh! Yep.

MATT: All right. So it succeeds its first saving throw and it succeeds its second saving throw. But you do see with each strike the intent of the sword to draw some of the strength and life force from the target. Not really making any effect, unfortunately. All right! Ending your turn, Grog, that vibration you feel in the ground, now? It's curious, because the worm itself is out of the ground, now. What caused you to lose your shot? You feel it grow stronger and stronger, before suddenly, nearby, a secondary, different-looking, but similar in size, worm comes bursting out of the base of the cavern.

LAURA: Matthew Mercer! You're trying to kill us.

MATT: You can see now, as this bursts out, it's similar in size, but different. This one has a thicker body, it's a purple and white type exterior, and you can see frozen mist is just emanating from the outside of its open jaw.

LAURA: No, this is the one that pukes ice.

MARISHA: (laughs) Pukes ice?

LAURA: This is what made the dude frozen!

MATT: As this one rears back, opens its jaw, and a burst of cold air and ice shards comes spraying out of its mouth–

LAURA: Look at this cone you have.

MATT: Heading towards these– actually, it would get the other worm too.

LAURA: Yes! Yes! Freeze the other worm!

MATT: I need a constitution saving throw from Grog and Vax.

LIAM: I want to do an Evasion, that's an area effect!

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: Yeah?

MATT: Make your constitution saving throw.

LIAM: All right. (laughs) Do I do the dex save first, or–?

MATT: It's not a dex save. Constitution save.

LIAM: Oh, it's not an area effect? All right. Whatever you say. Natural 20.

TRAVIS: 21.

MATT: 21. All right. Good.

TRAVIS: Saving throw, right? Constitution?

MATT: Constitution saving throw. So, read your ability real fast, does it affect only dex saves?

LIAM: Evasion on dex save– I've written an abbreviated version of this. It's area of effect, if it's like Fireball or anything that's in an area.

MATT: Right, but I think it may specify whether or not–

LIAM: Oh, but you're god, what do you want me to do?

MATT: I'm just looking it up right now, give me a second.

TRAVIS: Ooh! I have Danger Sense. I have advantage on dexterity saving throws.

MATT: This is not dexterity. This is constitution.

SAM: Oh, but you know what? I have really good dexterity.

MATT: Yep, dexterity saving throw. So this does not affect this attack. Sorry. All right, so you both take half damage, as does the creature.

TALIESIN: That's a lot of rolling.

SAM: He's only rolling a d2. He's rolling a d2.

MATT: All right! That's 40 points of damage, halved, that's 20 points of cold damage to each of you, and the purple worm.

LIAM: Wait, 40 or 20?

TRAVIS: Holy shit.

LAURA: It does 40 points?!

LIAM: Can I do Uncanny– this is a new round, can I do Uncanny or not, yet?

MATT: It has not gotten back to your turn, so no.

LAURA: We're going to die!

TRAVIS: No, we're good! Shut up! We're fine!

MATT: All right. Now! It's Keyleth's turn.

MARISHA: Here's what I want to try and do. I want to try and hope to god I can get everyone in here.

LIAM: Shake that hangover off, Kiki.

MARISHA: I wanted to– oh wait, I'm trying to point the fucking– point the laser at the screen.

MATT: Yeah, don't point at the screen. Point it at the actual map. That's okay.

MARISHA: I want to try and go– five, ten, 15– can I go through Grog? Through there?

MATT: You can try to, yeah.

LAURA: You're going to go past the worm, though!

MARISHA: Can I go there? Wait, wait, back closer to the– I want to be able to try and– can I see Scanlan and stuff, over there?

MATT: You can see Scanlan, you can see pretty much everybody but Trinket from this perspective, and you can't see Pike.

LAURA: Shit.

MARISHA: All right.

LAURA: Thought I was helping.

MARISHA: Everyone, I guess, who's within 30 range of me, I'm going to do a wind blast, and we all turn into poofy cloud versions of ourselves.

MATT: Which one is this?

MARISHA: Wind Walk. Poofy Cloud. So as I run past Grog, I brush his shoulder, and he turns into a mist form, and I turn into a mist form, and then I blast it out, and everyone's mist form!

MATT: All right, cool. So while in mist form, you guys have a flying speed of 300 feet, you have resistance to non-magical weapons, you can only dash.

MARISHA: Oh, you can't attack?

MATT: No. You've got to read your spell. You can take a minute to revert your form, but as of right now, all of you guys currently, everyone within 30 feet.

SAM: I'm not within 30 feet.

MATT: You can see within range, so you can't see Pike. You've got to read the spell. Does not affect Trinket because you can't see Trinket. Doesn't affect you guys. Scanlan is just out of range. So Vex and Scanlan, you're unaffected. You watch half of the party turn into these gaseous forms.

SAM: Oh my god, the worms have turned us all into clouds!

LAURA: You've left us stranded. We're going to die.

MARISHA: No, we're still there.

MATT: It takes a minute to revert to your actual form to be able to do any sort of attack.

MARISHA: Man, that was going to be way cooler if we could still…

TALIESIN: I'm going to do something insane. I've got some plans.

MARISHA: It was a 6th-level spell.

MATT: I know.

SAM: It was so good.

MARISHA: Thanks, guys. I feel so validated.

LIAM: She just learned it yesterday!

MARISHA: I did just learn it yesterday.

MATT: Vax, it's your turn.

LIAM: And I'm made of wind?

MATT: You're made of wind. You can move. You can dash, or you can begin to revert, if you'd like.

LIAM: I can begin to revert? So it's a minute-long process that I have to consciously decide, and I know this?

MATT: You get the feeling that if you want to return, it will take you a while because you don't really know what to do with your form.

MARISHA: We could try and get the fuck out of here.

LIAM: I'm going to use disengage and I'm going to fart over towards my sister and Pike.

MATT: You cannot disengage. You can only dash in this form.

LIAM: Oh, then I'm going to dash towards my sister and Pike.

LAURA: Pike is on the other side. Me and Scanlan.

LIAM: Oh. Scanlan and Vex, sorry.

MATT: So you move over.

SAM: Not all short people look alike.

MATT: You dash over here. That guy's going to take an attack of opportunity on you. He's going to have disadvantage, technically, because you all of a sudden stopped moving and it just hears the sound. It rolled a three. No. It whips past you with its mouth biting at nothing.

LIAM: I want to land and then start thinking, god, I wish I was not made of farts, and start trying to undo whatever this is.

MATT: Okay. Ten rounds later, you will be a physical entity.

LAURA: Ten rounds?!

MATT: A minute.

LIAM: Dispel Magic, little man!

LAURA: Okay, can I see him? Can I shoot through him?

MATT: You can shoot through him. He'll take half damage.

LIAM: I'm crouching!

MARISHA: We could use this to our advantage and get the fuck away, so I don't feel like I just wasted a 6th-level spell. Just want to say.

LIAM: Fog of war, man.

MATT: Do you have Dispel Magic, Scanlan?

SAM: That would have been great.

(laughter)

MATT: Sorry.

MARISHA: I technically do, but fuck that.

LAURA: You can float up to the ceiling and then attack from high.

MARISHA: I did learn Dispel Magic, but–

SAM: Well, dispel your own shit.

MARISHA: No! Figure it out! Make it work for yourselves, assholes. That was a 6th-level spell, god damn it.

MATT: Did you make yourself mist, as well?

MARISHA: Yeah! It's ten people!

MATT: You can't cast a spell in mist form, either.

MARISHA: We're all shit out of luck! How does that feel?

MATT: So who's left, currently? That finishes Vax's turn.

LIAM: Everyone who's a cloud, we're floating back to Emon. Let's go.

TALIESIN: (singing) I can show you the world.

MARISHA: I thought we could still attack, which would be way dope.

MATT: That would be dope, but that would be way too powerful a spell for sixth level. This is more of a means of travel spell, or a means of escape spell.

LIAM: Let's solve the problem

LAURA: But half of the party is still not able to escape.

MARISHA: If you don't move, they'll go away.

MATT: This creature, now, having been hit by the terrifying Eyebite spell, its insides churning and the impact from damage it's taken, it's looking like it had a harsh round last turn. As all of the movement suddenly (poof) vanishes and there's no general movement, the last thing it recalls that was in its vicinity and still shifting with a heartbeat across the ground is you, Scanlan. (impact noise) It bursts out of the ground right in front of you. It brings its jaw down over the top, with disadvantage. That's a natural 20, so thank god it has disadvantage. 19.

SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to try and not have it hit me.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: I'll sing, (singing) do you really want to hurt me? Do you really want to bite my body? Okay, that taunts him.

MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10 to reduce that from the attack.

SAM: A d10. this one? Wait, that's yours; why am I doing yours?

MATT: That's a 19 plus nine. This is 28 is what it rolled total.

SAM: 28 is what it rolled total?!

MATT: It rolled a 19 on the dice.

SAM: Oh fuck, even if I rolled a ten, I couldn't do anything. I rolled a three.

MATT: Okay, so as you're singing this, its jaw comes down on you (slamming sound), bites down painfully onto Scanlan for– that's the wrong dice–

TALIESIN: This could go worse.

MARISHA: Shut up, Taliesin.

MATT: 19 points of piercing damage. And I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

SAM: I'm great at those. Dexterity saving throw. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, that's a five.

MATT: Those of you who are watching, you see as the mouth (impact sound) chomps down on Scanlan and as it pulls away, Scanlan is nowhere in sight, having been swallowed by the purple worm.

TALIESIN: Oh, shit!

MATT: You are blinded and restrained, and yeah. You just see darkness and you feel the muscles constricting as you're forced down its throat. As your feet splash into what seems to be some sort of highly acidic liquid that resides in the inside of its body.

SAM: Tell me this, Dungeon Master. Earlier when I had done my Eyebite thing, I had my cone up here. When he grabbed me was the cone still close to my mouth?

MATT: Sure, we'll say that. However, I do need you to make a concentration check because of the damage you sustained on this.

SAM: Okay. Concentration check. Concentration? I've never rolled for concentration. Oh wait!

MATT: I know, I'm trying to keep up on that more now.

SAM: I have advantage on spell concentration.

MATT: Because of your feat that you took.

SAM: Well, that wasn't good either. So one was a five and one was a ten. Do I add anything to that?

MATT: All right so, it's a constitution saving throw and half the damage you took. So you're trying to beat a nine.

SAM: Constitution. So 12.

MATT: So 12. So yes, you succeed. So you currently, even though you're constrained, you're still maintaining your Eyebite spell against the purple worm.

SAM: Okay.

MATT: All right. So that ends the worm's turn. Scanlan, it is now your turn.

SAM: Great. I don't want be in here anymore.

MATT: Correct.

SAM: Can I look around? It's dark. It seems cozy. Seems nicer than outside right now, actually. I dip my finger in the acid. Ooo!

MATT: (sizzling sound) Not fun, not fun.

SAM: It's not good. So I'm going to make him barf me up.

MARISHA: Oh that's right, it was sick, right?

MATT: It's sickened currently by the spell effect you put, yeah.

SAM: I'm going to cast, at level five, Thunderwave. With my Hand Cone of Clarity up in my grill. I'm going to explode him from the inside.

MATT: All right, Thunderwave. So at fifth level, that would be an additional 4d8. That is 6d8 thunder damage.

TRAVIS: Holy shit.

SAM: Where's the d8s?

MATT: It makes a constitution saving throw.

TRAVIS: He's inside. Come on, Armageddon this motherfucker.

MATT: That is a 16 on the saving throw.

SAM: 19 is my save.

MATT: So, 6d8.

SAM: What's that? I've already lost count. 15 plus seven. Whatever that is.

MATT: 22 points of–

SAM: Wait 6d8, yeah okay.

MATT: Okay. It (impact sound) booms from the inside and you can see a central part of the worm (muffled boom) billow out like a cartoon as this bit of smoke emanates from its mouth. Just the sheer force of it forces you a little ways up its throat, but not enough to jettison yourself out of its body. Its muscles are too strong and you feel like you need to do a little more damage to it from the inside to be able to escape.

SAM: Okay. But it did hurt it, yes?

MATT: It hurt it, yeah. It took some damage. And at this point as well, you (grunt) feel your body being pulled inward and crushed by the muscles. Percy. You're up, Mr. Mistform.

TALIESIN: Okay. These creatures have no eyes.

MATT: Correct.

TALIESIN: I'm made of smoke.

MATT: (affirmative sound)

TALIESIN: (sighs) Okay.

TRAVIS: Yes. Well established.

TALIESIN: As long as we're all clear here what's going on, that's fine. And I can just dash?

MATT: That's all you can do. Or begin to try and revert, which will take ten rounds.

TALIESIN: Well, and can I still move around and do things while I'm trying to revert or is it– Reverting. Am I just stuck reverting?

MATT: You know, that's a good question.

TALIESIN: Can I just make the decision?

MATT: I think you can still move around, you just think you have to have concentration towards it, I'll have to–

TALIESIN: I'm going to have my concentration on reverting. But in the meantime, I'm going to–

MATT: You can use your action to begin to revert your form, yeah.

TALIESIN: I have to use my action?

MATT: However, nope! Reverting takes a minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can't move.

TALIESIN: (sputtering)

MATT: So yeah. So currently–

MARISHA: Yeah he's really married to this one.

MATT: It took me ten seconds to read it!

LIAM: So to get out of this form, we have to stop and like meditate in one position for a full minute. What does it dissipate without doing that? How long does it take?

MATT: Eight hours.

LIAM: Eight hours, good.

MARISHA: Wait, what? No, no, no! One– Oh no, yeah, you're right.

SAM: Can't you just kill it? Wait a second, hold on a second.

MARISHA: Yeah, can I not kill it at all? I can't kill it?

MATT: Not if you're in wind form, no.

MARISHA: Question. Can I switch to an animal form?

MATT: You cannot take any other action aside from dash or reverting when in this form.

TALIESIN: Can I dash into one of the creatures?

MARISHA: Why would you do that?

MATT: I mean, you could try to. You would surround it with smoke.

LAURA: You're made of wind!

TALIESIN: It wouldn't know that I was there? It wouldn't–

TRAVIS: You could either dispel it or you could flee.

TALIESIN: Okay, well I had the thought of maybe I could attempt to get them to attack each other.

MATT: I mean, that can be attempted. How are you going to do that? No, you can't talk in this form. What are you trying to do?

TALIESIN: I'm attempting to tap them to get them to think that there's something happening where the worms are to get them to attack.

SAM: Like a Three Stooges thing.

MATT: Okay, so you swirl this way as a dash and attempt to make an impact. I'll say go ahead and make a strength check.

TALIESIN: Really?

MATT: Yes. With disadvantage and a serious penalty. Because you're mist. Go for it.

TALIESIN: Natural 20, Motherfucker!

MATT: Okay, roll again, because it's with disadvantage.

TALIESIN: (screams)

(laughter)

LIAM: Here comes the one.

TALIESIN: Baby, I know we've been arguing a lot lately. But I want you to know I take it all back, I take it all back. I'm going to buy you something so nice. I'm going to buy you ice cream. I'm going to buy you good ice cream! I'm going to go to Scoops. Three, motherfucker.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Which brings me to four.

MATT: All right. As the coldish mist of Percy batters itself helplessly and ineffective against the body of the giant frost worm creature, seeming to no effect as it's now keeping itself attentive on what is nearby and within its range of motion.

TALIESIN: I will use an action surge and start turning back into a normal human then.

MATT: Well, you can continue to use your movement; you only moved a short bit.

TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to move behind it then. That way. No, I mean far away from it. And then I'm going to use an action surge and start meditating on it.

MATT: Okay, it does attempt to take an attack of opportunity as it just feels you rush by. Nah, it misses. Rolled a two.

TALIESIN: That's what it feels like, motherfucker.

MATT: All right. So, that end your turn?

TALIESIN: Yeah that ended it.

MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Cool.

SAM: Vex, you and me babe, all we got to do is last ten rounds. Of course, all you hear is (muffled cries).

LAURA: I know, I've got to save you!

TALIESIN: Trinket's there too.

LAURA: I know.

MATT: Oh, I get to make the save to see if the Eyebite maintains itself. That would be a– no, it rolled a ten and it's minus two on its wisdom save. So it still has disadvantage on its attacks.

LAURA: Okay, all right. Are there any stalactites coming from the ceiling?

MATT: There are, actually. There's a number of them. Just in this general vicinity there's a whole mess of them up above from just the natural formation of it.

LAURA: Okay, I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage at the ceiling and try to create noise away from us.

MATT: Whereabouts?

LAURA: How about towards the ceiling above the frost worm?

MATT: Over there? Okay. All right, so, okay. The frost worm is in the way to hit that angle, so you may have to move to do so.

LAURA: Which way could I shoot that he would not be in the way?

MATT: You have to probably move this way to get around him just to hit him at this angle just because it's such a large entity.

LAURA: Huh? God, I don't know. I mean.

MATT: What you got?

LAURA: I'm going to move as quietly as I can around towards that little crevice.

MATT: Go ahead and make a general dexterity check.

LAURA: Just add my dexterity to it? 17?

MATT: 17? Okay. As you move past, stepping as gingerly as you can, you can see it slap; it moves its face in the direction of where you're going, but you just manage to move beyond where it thought you were, and it misses you as you move by. So now you have visual on it.

LAURA: Okay. Now I want to shoot Conjure Barrage at the ceiling above the frost one.

MATT: Okay. Conjure Barrage up here. Go ahead and roll damage.

LAURA: Okay. That is 3d8, I guess. 14 plus five. What's 14 plus five? 19.

MATT: 19 damage? All right. And with that, you release a blasting torrent of arrows at the ceiling in this giant cone blast. It strikes into the ceiling through the force of the magical bow that you're holding. You can see a number of rocks in bits and pieces begin to chip off, and a few small stalactites crack and plummet downward. I need a dex save from Grog and Keyleth.

MARISHA: Dex save?

MATT: Dex save.

LIAM: We still take damage in this form, right?

MATT: You do. You just take half damage from non-magical sources.

MARISHA: Regular dexterity save or do we get advantage because we're misty?

MATT: You have resistance to non-magical weapons.

MARISHA: Do we have advantage?

MATT: No. You take half damage because you're misty.

MARISHA: I don't think I made my dexterity check.

MATT: What did you roll?

MARISHA: A two.

TRAVIS: I have advantage. Danger sense. Dexterity saving throws. Total of 20.

MATT: There you go. All right, so that is a total of seven damage to Keyleth, halved to four because you're in mist form. Seven damage to the frost worm.

LAURA: Seven damage because of the stalactites?

MATT: Yep. They fell on it. Four damage to you.

LAURA: I'm going to look over at Trinket, and I'm going to go–

MATT: Actually, no damage to you because you completely dodged out of the way.

LAURA: I'm going to go like this to Trinket, and I'm going to shoot another arrow. I can't do the same thing. I'm going to shoot an arrow at the ceiling right above the frost thing, and then I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Okay. Oh, god. That didn't do any– Well, I was hitting a stalactite, which is totally still, so it was 13?

MATT: 13? Because of your half-elf eyes, able to see in this dark interior of the cavern, I'd say yes, that hits. Barely.

LAURA: So just a regular d8. Yep. 11.

MATT: 11 damage, all right. 11 damage. It falls. Yeah, it does not make its resistance to the fall, so the stalactite falls. Larger than the previous ones that were knocked out by the barrage that loosened it up. This one crumbles, slamming into the head of the frost worm for three points of bludgeoning damage. All right.

LAURA: And then I stealth for 21 points of stealth.

MATT: Okay, good to know. All right. Ending your turn, it's now Pike. Pike, who currently is confused by the circumstances that have currently happened. She steps out. She's not mist. She steps out.

LAURA: Why would you do that?! Why would you do that? You're going to kill her.

TRAVIS: She would know better than that!

LAURA: She would hide!

LIAM: She could be our saving grace. Let the man–

SAM: She's the only one who's got arms and legs right now.

MATT: Keyleth left the alcove after saying stay still, she saw a few individuals turn to mist on the outside. She's very worried and confused by the circumstances.

LAURA: I'm sorry, I didn't shoot an arrow. I just realized I didn't shoot an arrow at his worm and I meant to, and I'm sorry.

SAM: What worm? My worm?

LAURA: The one that you're in.

SAM: You could have hit me! It's okay. Don't worry.

MATT: Pike comes around the corner. “Guys? What's happening?” And all she sees is you disappear into the shadows on the side, Trinket being very quiet, and mist swirling in the space around as these two giant worms (growls) as parts of the cavern are collapsing into it.

LAURA: Can I do that to her?

MATT: She doesn't see you do it because you're hidden. No, she doesn't see you. She doesn't roll high enough perception. Right now, she feels alone and doesn't understand what she can possibly do in this. She doesn't have any indication of what to do in the circumstance, so she is going to–

TRAVIS: Does Pike have Dispel Magic?

MATT: She does.

SAM: She doesn't even know–

MATT: She doesn't know what's happening. She's going to cast Flame Strike, 5th-level spell. It's a ten-foot radius. She's going to blast this one right here, which is the one she sees now closest to her proximity and being ice-based. So that's 8d6 radiant damage.

SAM: Hey! Nice job, Pike!

MATT: 32 points of fire damage. Does not make its save. Suddenly from the ground, you see the rocks shake and lift for a second before a beam of divine fire (explosion) comes bursting out of the ground in a ten-foot radius around this worm. However, I do need a dexterity saving throw from both Grog and Keyleth.

TRAVIS: Okay.

LIAM: Keep your head in the game!

TRAVIS: 18.

MARISHA: What? Shut up, Liam.

LIAM: Get it. Get it, girl, get it.

MARISHA: 16.

MATT: 16? So that's going to be 32 damage to that. That's going to be 16 damage to you, Grog, and 32 damage to you, Keyleth.

MARISHA: All right, 32.

MATT: Fire and radiant damage. As she just sees mist in the air around the frost worm and has no indication of exactly what happened. However, the frost worm did take it as well. That's going to end her turn as she isn't quite sure what to do at that point. That brings us to the top of the round, Grog.

TRAVIS: What do I–? I can't leave.

LAURA: Just back away from it.

TRAVIS: I'll just back up to the tunnel leading out of the– yeah.

MATT: Okay.

All right, that brings us to–

TRAVIS: Oh, and I'd like to start to revert, if I could.

MATT: Okay. You'll be there for a minute doing so. You can't move any further. You can't move, you're just sitting there focusing on– incapacitated.

TRAVIS: No, I don't start to revert.

MATT: Okay. All right, that completes your turn. Now we come to the frost worm's turn. The frost worm, first and foremost, it gets its frost breath back. It turns this way, burrows underneath, and, seeing all the movement to this side, goes ahead and unleashes a secondary frost breath in this direction. That will only affect the purple worm and Vax. I need you guys to make constitution saving throws.

LIAM: And I can't remember, Evasion has nothing to do with this?

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: Okay, I'm going to use Luck. My last Luck. That's not good. So constitution save?

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: Seven.

MATT: Seven? Nope. Purple worm also does not make it, so that'll be to both of you…

LAURA: So obviously these worms don't even care about each other at all.

MATT: No. Seemingly, in this moment you see now, there is not a kinship between them. If anything, they both arrived due to feeling the same movement and one is currently now attacking whatever is large and in the area that it doesn't recognize the center movement of.

MARISHA: Does that mean we could just get them fighting each other?

LAURA: That is what I'm thinking, we could get them to fight.

MATT: 36 points of cold damage to you. 36 points to the purple worm.

SAM: That halved?

MATT: No, it is magical damage, not blunt damage, so you just take it. Especially as mist, cold is bad as mist. All right, so with that, the purple–

SAM: Wait. Doesn't my worm take it too?

MATT: He did. Both of them are still there.

SAM: Still alive?

MATT: Yeah. Looking a little rough, but it's still alive. All right, that ends its turn. Now it's Keyleth's turn.

MARISHA: Okay, here's my question.

MATT: Yep?

TRAVIS: Probably no.

MARISHA: I know.

(laughter)

SAM: Can I juggle while I'm a mist?

MATT: If you wanted to, because it is your spell that you cast, even though it's technically not concentration–

MARISHA: I will say, we all failed in reading it, also–

SAM: Don't do this, don't do this!

TALIESIN: (laughs) Can't win.

LAURA: It's also what? What does it say?

MARISHA: Nothing.

TALIESIN: I'll say it if it makes you feel better?

LIAM: Why don't we let him say what he was going to say?

MATT: What were you going to say?

MARISHA: Nothing.

MATT: No, what's up?

MARISHA: I'm afraid now.

TALIESIN: As you should be. You're defying god.

SAM: What were you going to say, Matt?

MARISHA: Yeah, what were you going to say? (laughs) I like that question.

LAURA: Yeah, right? Since you cast it, you could break your concentration?

MATT: I'm saying, because you cast a spell that wasn't a concentration spell, if it was a positive effect, which it technically is, and you did not want it, you could cancel the spell. I'd let you do that. If you wanted to. What did I not read?

MARISHA: We all failed in reading it.

TALIESIN: Casting time.

MATT: One action.

TALIESIN: No.

TALIESIN and MARISHA: One minute.

MATT: It says one action on my thing.

MARISHA: It says one action on yours? It says one minute on mine.

MATT: Does it?

MARISHA: Yes, it does.

MATT: Thank you, Fight Club Five.

MARISHA: No, it's different. It says casting time one minute.

MATT: Let's see what the Player's Handbook says.

TALIESIN: Consult the book.

LAURA: It doesn't matter, it already happened.

MARISHA: It already happened, so it doesn't matter.

TRAVIS: Shouldn't there be an ad for Gilmore's Glorious Goods right about now?

MARISHA: Yeah, it's already happened, we're already committed.

MATT: In the Player's Handbook, Wind Walk is one minute, you're right.

MARISHA: One minute. So Fight Club failed.

MATT: Fight Club Five failed.

SAM: This is a reverse ad for Fight Club Five.

MATT: Or I have to update it. Either way. No, It might have been fixed since, I've just got to update it. All right. Well, anyway. In a bit of druidic inspiration, you manage to, very quickly, for the first time–

MARISHA: I mean, I'm still willing to commit to it. It's fine.

MATT: Being as an Air Ashari, this is your realm of expertise, and your first time using it, you were so excited that you managed to accelerate the casting of the spell, regardless of the situation it may have created, so, what do you want to do?

MARISHA: So I accelerated the casting of the spell.

LAURA: So you can cancel it if you feel like canceling it.

SAM: If you want to.

LAURA: Some people's brothers in the room are at a really low health level right now. I don't know who we're talking about, but some people's brothers–

MARISHA: Are you giving me an out because you feel bad? Because if you're giving me an out–

MATT: No, because technically it shouldn't have happened, because it was a one-minute casting time. There are many things in that spell that were not read, by the caster, so I'm giving you the opportunity to correct the mistake, if you wish not to take it, you can.

TALIESIN: I read the card too, I didn't see it.

MARISHA: He did read the card too, and we all thought it was a good idea.

MATT: This was a very hard and valuable lesson for casters.

LAURA: We're in the middle of a battle.

MARISHA: (laughing) For my own shame. All right fine, I'll drop the spell 'cause I feel really bad about it. But on my way down, okay, here's my question, because I want to make these fuckers fight each other. So, is there loose rock along the edge of the wall?

LAURA: I dropped stalactites on them. So yeah, there's lots of loose rock.

MATT: Yeah. And there's rubble on the ground next to it from where the original cave-in happened

MARISHA: Okay, so as I'm dropping the spell–

MATT: All of you who are mist form now revert, and you fall about five to ten feet and catch yourself on the ground, no harm no foul.

MARISHA: As I revert back can I slide down that wall to create some–

MATT: Did you want to move first over here to do it?

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: So you shift over, you drop the spell.

MARISHA: Uh-huh, I drop the spell, and as I drop the spell I want to grab some wall and bring it down to make a big vibration, right in between these two motherfuckers.

MATT: Okay. Make a strength check.

MARISHA: Oh, jeez Louise. Oh, that's not too bad. It's not a saving throw.

MATT: Correct. Just a strength check; add your strength modifier.

MARISHA: 18?

MATT: 18. All right. So, as you slide down, you grab onto some of the loose rock and (rockslide) they come tumbling down as you slide down. So you land here, at the base of the two worms, and rocks tumble around you at the base of the cave-in. And you get the sensation that you may have made a decent bit of racket right around your feet.

MARISHA: Uh-huh. Do I have any movement?

MATT: I'd say you have half your movement.

MARISHA: Oh, Jesus Christ. Can I just tiptoe backwards towards Percy? Or should I– You know what? I'm going to stay. I'm just going to stay right there. Is that even worse of a decision?

MATT: I don't know. What do you want to do?

MARISHA: I'm just going to– up against the wall. And not move.

MATT: Okay. You're going to Doctor Grant this.

MARISHA: I'm going to Doctor Grant it.

MATT: Got it. Okay. Keyleth, that ends your turn, Vax, you're up. You now have your physical form again.

LIAM: Okay. I look around really fast, run up to my sister, give her a giant hug, and (magic sound) Dimension Door over to where Grog is.

SAM: You can Dimension Door; I keep forgetting that!

MATT: So as you rush over and grab onto her, you both (poof!) in a Nightcrawler-esque poof of smoke, as it settles, you are both no longer there, as– What's the range on the Dimension Door?

LIAM: Oh, it's so far, it's like 500 feet I believe. I'll find it.

MATT: I believe it is. Dimension Door, yeah, it's fine. 300 feet, you're fine. You guys appear over by Grog now.

LAURA: Is that the edge of a cliff over on that side?

MATT: It goes right to the edge, right there, and this is where it would go down the side of a giant, icy mountain. You guys are at the very, very top of a very cold, cragulous part of the Cliffkeep Mountains.

LAURA: Got it.

LIAM: I'm hasted; do I have one or two attacks at this point?

MATT: You have one attack right now.

LIAM: One attack? Okay.

MATT: You went up and did your action already.

LIAM: Action. Okay. Well then, I'm going to throw a dagger at the back of the frost one.

MATT: Okay. What's the range on your dagger?

LIAM: It's 60 feet, Sharpshooter, no disadvantage.

MATT: 60 feet. Just misses. You go (knife sound) and it just tumbles, scrapes across the ground, stops at the base of the worm, and then vanishes. All right, that ends your turn. Now it is this guy's turn. At the top of his turn, Scanlan, you– all right.

SAM: I'm in a nice womb.

MATT: You take…

TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

TALIESIN: All the damage.

TRAVIS: He grimaced. Still rolling.

MATT: 23 points of acid damage as it begins to digest you from the inside.

SAM: Aren't I immune to acid damage?

MATT: Are you?

SAM: Because of the feast?

MATT: No, poison.

SAM: Isn't that the same thing?

MATT: No.

(laughter)

MATT: All right. So. The–

LAURA: Somebody's got something of Acid Resistance, though. Somebody has an item.

LIAM: I had armor and I gave it to someone, I don't have it anymore.

MATT: As the frost worm and the purple worm are now clashing in this space, they both turn, hearing the sound. Now, the frost damage that had impacted the purple worm last turn, let's see if it– Nope! It's going to retaliate for that, it's going to attempt to make a bite attack against the frost worm. That is going to be a 12, that is going to miss. However, hearing the noise, it's going to make a tail attack at the direction that Keyleth is– That's a natural one. As it arcs through, it (impact) right next to your head and then pulls out of the rubble. The rock to your left is now cracked and broken with a giant hole where the stinger had placed itself.

MARISHA: I hold my breath.

MATT: Yeah. Disadvantage on those attacks from that Eyebite is really bad. So that's been very helpful from Scanlan's point. By the way, Scanlan, make another concentration check because of the–

SAM: Concentration check. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 18 and 19.

MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Okay. That ends the purple worm's turn, it's going to stay right there. Actually, no. It's going to burrow away, as currently it's made its attacks. It's going to burrow into the ground, and is currently not within anyone's visual range.

LAURA: I have it Hunter's Marked, can I feel it?

MATT: You can sense that it's underneath the ground, somewhere in this cavern.

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: That brings us to Scanlan.

SAM: It's going down.

MATT: It's going through the ground, you feel it moving around.

TALIESIN: Shake it, shake it, shake it.

SAM: So it has poison, right? It's poisoned me– Oh, it has acid.

MATT: Yeah. It's acid. You're feeling yourself digest within its body.

SAM: Can I make an intelligence check to see if I know anything about these creatures?

MATT: You can if you'd like to, from the inside of its body, yeah, go ahead.

SAM: Is that my action? No, it's…

MATT: No, no, no, I'll let you do it because you've been very close and personal with it.

TALIESIN: You've had a lot of time to think.

SAM: Specifically what I'm trying to remember from my encounters in the past is if it has any resistance to poison damage.

MATT: Go for it.

SAM: What am I doing? Intelligence?

MATT: Intelligence. Add your intelligence modifier.

SAM: 16. 16.

MATT: 16, okay. You've heard of these types of entities before. You're uncertain whether or not it has a resistance to poison, per se. You get the sensation probably, based on the fact that it uses poison, you would think so, but nothing else about its body seems to be poison-related or of the essence of poison.

SAM: But it does use poison?

MATT: As part of its tail. The stinger you saw it use earlier does seem to have some–

SAM: Oh, gotcha. Okay, so it probably does have poison resistance. Okay.

MATT: You don't know. But you do know, also, that if you were able to probably do enough damage from the inside, it would probably throw you back up. You also get the sense that since you're currently underground, now would be a bad time to do that.

SAM: Well, I'm in a tunnel, right?

MATT: As far as you know, yeah.

LAURA: There could be other worms around.

SAM: He disappeared down– well, I don't know anything! Okay, all right, I can feel him moving, so I don't know where I am anymore. So I don't want to Dimension Door out, because I don't know where I'd end up. So instead I will cast Stinking Cloud inside– No, no, no! No. No, no. Cancel! Belay that order! Shit! Because I think he's immune to poison, so I'm not going to do that. I'm going to– Fuck! There's nothing I can do!

LAURA: Can you take a healing potion in case he starts to digest you some more?

SAM: (strained) I'm like this right now. I can't do anything.

LAURA: Can you go like that, and get a healing potion and (mumbled) go like that?

SAM: I am My Left Foot. Yeah, I can't reach a wand. I don't want to get rid of–

MATT: You could Dimension Door, in theory.

SAM: But I don't know where I'd end up?

MATT: As part of the spell you can either visualize a place you can see, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction. So you've already been inside the room, you know what it looks like, so if you think you're somewhat close by–

SAM: So even if I've moved since I saw it last, I can still Dimension Door to where I think–?

MATT: In theory, yeah.

SAM: Okay, then I will do that. I will do that.

MATT: Okay. Where do you want to appear within the room?

SAM: I want to appear where Vex was before.

MATT: Okay. So, you–

LAURA: No, I was further over.

MATT: He didn't see that. Last thing he saw was you were right next to him before he got eaten. So you disappear from the inside of its stomach and appear in a puff of smoke.

SAM: Goo! Goo all over me! Ew! Oh, and then I see– I've seen the other worm before, right?

MATT: Briefly, before you were swallowed, yes.

SAM: And I get my bearings, and I can see Pike, I can see Trinket.

MARISHA: You also see me against a wall right next to you.

SAM: So I will shake it off, I will inspire Keyleth and say, (singing) I only want to see you slicing up that purple worm!

ALL: (singing) Purple worm! Purple worm!

SAM: Ooh! Okay, that's good.

MATT: d10 inspiration die to you, Keyleth.

MARISHA: I love that song!

MATT: Ends your turn, Scanlan. Percy, you're up. You just caught yourself on the ground on the far end, by the tunnel.

TALIESIN: I want to hold my turn until the other worm returns.

MATT: Hold your action, you mean? So you want to move anywhere or are you going to stay where you are?

TALIESIN: Not going to move anywhere, just going to stay right there.

MATT: All right. Cool. That ends Percy's turn as he's holding his action until it returns. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: I'm going to shoot from my Blazing Bowstring at the icy worm.

MATT: That's your second and final use this day.

LAURA: Yeah, I know. 17?

MATT: 17 unfortunately misses. Your flaming arrow streaks off the darkness of the cavern and just passes it before it slams against the far cave wall.

LAURA: Balls, balls, balls! So I'm going to shoot– Nope, not going to do that. I'm going to shoot a regular old arrow at him!

MATT: Do it! Hey, those are still helpful.

LAURA: And it doesn't do anything. It goes right past him, and hits the wall, and he looks towards the wall.

MATT: An arrow isn't a very hefty thing when it's by itself hitting stonework. It makes a noise, you can barely make out, we'll see if it's enough to distract it. Are you going to stay where you are?

LAURA: Oh, I could have used my inspiration. I should have used it on the Blazing Bowstring one.

SAM: Hey man, whatever.

MATT: What are you going to do? Are you going to move? Do you want Trinket to move? Are you going to stay where you are?

LAURA: Everybody's staying!

MATT: Okay, gotcha. All right, Pike, now, seeing everyone revert, and seeing this kind of awkward situation of these creatures moving about is going to– Yeah, and– She can't see you because you're on the other side of the wall.

LAURA: Can I use my bonus action to hide?

MATT: Sure.

LAURA: I do that!

MATT: I would recommend moving to one side of the cavern or the other, because right now you're still out in the open. It's kind of hard to hide if you have nowhere to hide. But you also get the feeling that these creatures– being visually hidden is not affecting it at all.

LAURA: Doesn't matter? Then I don't do anything!

MATT: All right. So you stay still. Pike stands still, figuring that it was helpful last time but feeling bad for accidentally– now seeing the mist reverting to her friends– that she blasted them on the previous round. Let's see. She didn't realized in the moment that you guys turned into mist while she was in the corner.

TRAVIS: It's all right. I've had worse.

MATT: I'm pretty sure she has another 5th-level spell, and this would be the last of them. She's going to go ahead and Flame Strike again on the frost worm. This time centering it around there, so the ten-foot radius only hits the worm and doesn't see any allies nearby. So that will be 8d6. 33 points of damage.

LAURA: Go, Pike!

MATT: Natural 20 on the save, though, so it takes half the damage.

LAURA: Damn you! Dick.

MATT: 17 points to the frost worm. All right, Pike casts that and then stays perfectly still in space, she still has some motion and some speech to it, but her feet are planted firmly on the ground. Hopefully that's enough. And that finishes her turn. Back to the top: Grog.

TRAVIS: Did you hold your action?

TALIESIN: I held my action

TRAVIS: Until when?

TALIESIN: Until the other worm returns.

TRAVIS: I'll do the same thing.

MATT: Okay. The frost worm, it's now its turn. It does not get its frost breath. However–

TALIESIN: There's a rock slide to its right.

MATT: It is! There is a rock slide. That Keyleth is standing in. Thank you for the reminder.

TALIESIN: Damn it! Sorry.

MARISHA: Thanks for that.

MATT: It's going to turn around. You can see now, its tail emerges, and it's going to arc up and try and bite and slam in your direction with both sides of its body at once. This tail does not have a stinger on it, but it is still a giant bludgeoning implement. First attack is going to be a 19 to hit?

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: Next one is going to be a 16 to hit.

MARISHA: No.

MATT: All right, so the tail slams on the ground next to you, estimating your position and failing and just hitting the rocks that you had slid down. However, it does bite down with its open, icy jaws. You take 17 points of piercing damage, as well as an additional six points of cold damage.

MARISHA: Bringing it to a total of 22?

MATT: 22, yeah.

TALIESIN: Sorry.

MARISHA: I deserved that.

TALIESIN: We live in a cold, cold world. No one deserves anything.

MATT: Let's see if it makes any sort of perception check. Okay, cool. That ends its turn. It's now Keyleth's turn.

MARISHA: So does it know that I'm there since it just took a big chunk out of me?

MATT: It senses that it impacted something and something that reacted and tasted like it had been bitten, so you get the sense that it knows you're there.

MARISHA: All right. I'm in arm's length of it, right?

MATT: You are.

MARISHA: I'm going to reach out and cast Blight on it.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: You touch me when you're trying to touch the worm. I don't know how–

MATT: Cast Blight on Taliesin! All right. Constitution saving throw. What's the DC on that?

MARISHA: 18.

MATT: 18. It does not make it. 16. So 8d8 necrotic damage to it.

SAM: Necrotic damage? Best kind.

MARISHA: Oh, jeez. What was that? Seven. Seven plus five. Seven, eight, 13, 16, and then another 12. Where was I at? 18. Oh, so 28, 32, 33 points.

MATT: 33 points of necrotic damage to the frost worm. As you reach out with your hand and grasp it, you can see now its icy white exterior all of a sudden shudders in place and you can see small cracks of black veins begin to spring out from your hands into its body. Its frozen breath all of a sudden thaws briefly into a dripping drool as it is stunned momentarily, and it pulls away, wrestling itself from your grasp. It did not enjoy that at all. So that's your action.

MARISHA: I'm going to once again not move. Can I go ahead and cast Healing Word on myself?

MATT: As a bonus action? I don't see why not.

MARISHA: Nine, total. That does help.

MATT: That ends your turn, Keyleth. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: All right. I want to see if I can use the haste to do double distance to get behind Pike in that little alcove. If I can't go that far, I'll use dash to get behind her.

MATT: You could. You can get behind her.

LIAM: Without the dash?

MATT: Yeah, because of your haste, you can move 60 feet.

LIAM: I'm standing right behind her and I say, Pike, I'm a little banged up. Dagger, dagger, dagger.

MATT: Okay, go for it. It is just– or no, it's within 30 feet.

LIAM: 17 for the first. 21 for the second.

MATT: Hits, hits.

LIAM: 18 for the third.

MATT: All three hit.

LAURA: Is it sneak attack because Keyleth's standing right next to it?

LIAM: All right, so first one is four. This is doubled, so that's 15 plus… 16, 21, 25, 28, 36 for the first.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: Second one is nine, and the third one is ten.

TALIESIN: Damn.

MATT: All right, as your barrage of blades (spinning noises) go spinning right over Pike's head, she feels the actual wind distortion (puff) past her hair, sending strands kind of wafting in front of her face as she just stays perfectly still, trusting you. The blades all (impacts) sinking into it, one of which strikes an area of the side of its body armor where the plates on the armor had seemed to be cracked from the blackened veins from her Blight spell. As it does, the dagger doesn't even stop and plunges directly into its body, and you can see a gout of dark, deep red blood just (spurt) out from the wound. It (screeches) shakes in place from the impact, the pain, it's starting to look a little harsh.

LIAM: Done.

MATT: All right, ends your turn! That brings us to the purple worm.

LAURA: (singing) Purple worm.

LAURA & MARISHA: (singing) Purple worm.

MATT: Purple worm is going to now emerge from the impact–

MARISHA: Come on, fight the big cocksucker.

MATT: It's going to burst out from the ground where you and Pike are as the last motion that it felt was you rushing over across the ground. (boom) It comes tearing through, making its bite attack against you and its tail attack against you as well, because of Pike not moving.

LIAM: Question!

MATT: Yes?

LIAM: Pike probably doesn't, but do I have any advantage being that I'm in this little closed-in bubble?

MATT: Technically, no, because it has reach. And it just kinda swerves around the inside and it knows this cavern pretty well as it's been through here a few times. So. That's going to be a 23 to hit on you?

LIAM: Of course that hits.

MATT: For the bite attack.

SAM: Even with its disadvantage?

MATT: Oh, with the disadvantage– sorry, the second roll– thank you for reminding me there. It would have been a 13 on the second one plus nine, that would be 20.

LIAM: Still hits! Uncanny Dodge please! To halve the damage.

MATT: To halve the damage? Yeah, you can do that on this one. But first then there's the bite. I will do that now. That is 21 points of piercing damage?

LIAM: Unconscious.

MATT: With it halved?

LIAM: 21 halved?

MATT: 21 halved would put you at 11.

LIAM: Oh, yeah. Okay, no, I'm still on my feet.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: (dazed mumbling)

MATT: The tail stinger's going to swing at you with disadvantage. That is 14. Rolled a six and a five. So, as the bite clamps down at you its tail tries to strike at you but misses entirely. However, its jaws attempt to close around you, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

LIAM: Hold on. 16.

MATT: 16. As you try and move out of the way, it's not quite fast enough as darkness takes you, the mouth (slam shut sound) clamps around you, (gulp noise) and you are swallowed.

LAURA: You didn't even get healed! (panicked gasp)

LIAM: Still conscious.

MATT: That ends its turn. Now having it appeared, as this round has happened, I would like both Grog and Percy to–

TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot the purple thing with a violent shot.

MATT: How many points into it?

TALIESIN: I'm going to drop all three points into violent shot.

MATT: Okay! That adds plus six to your misfire. So you have like a 46% chance of misfiring on this shot.

TALIESIN: If I roll a six. A six or lower. It–

MATT: Well, it adds plus two to your misfire per point spent.

TALIESIN: Oh! Never mind then! Oh shit! Then never mind. Then I'm just going to take two points of violent shot. So that's–

MATT: So that would bring it to a misfire of seven.

TALIESIN: Yeah.

MATT: Okay! So take your shot.

MARISHA: You misfire on a seven or lower?

TALIESIN: Yep.

MARISHA: Holy shit, Taliesin!

MATT: But if he hits it's two additional dice damage to it.

MARISHA: Come on, Golden Snitch!

TALIESIN: Seven.

MATT: You rolled a seven?

TALIESIN: I rolled a seven.

MATT: As you rear back, get ready to fire, all of a sudden, you pull the trigger and the way that you had customized the barrel to blast additional black powder blows up in your face and the gun actually bends out of the way and you feel the impact–

TALIESIN: Wait! I get to reroll something, don't I? Where is it? Where is it? Aw. Do I get a reroll?

Yeah. One save reroll per—

MATT: That's a saving throw reroll, that's not an attack, unfortunately. Yeah, the weapon misfires, doesn't do damage to you but the blast does not take off. You would have to repair the Bad News to use it again.

TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to pull out my new gun and take two shots.

MATT: Okay, so you drop Bad News, take two shots. Go for it.

TALIESIN: God damn it. (sighs)

TRAVIS: Come on, Percy!

TALIESIN: That hits! That's a 21.

MATT: That hits.

TALIESIN: I'm just going to roll the other one, too. And that's a 30, that hits. So that's, plus 12. Eight, 15, 25. That's 27 points of damage.

SAM: Lot of things going on in Matt Mercer's head right now.

MATT: All right. How do you want to do this?

MARISHA: Thank god! Such an asshole.

TALIESIN: Bad News is down, I toss it to the ground, I pull out the new one. I take my shot just to get its attention to get one in the mouth.

MATT: Okay, as you take one shot (gunshot noise) it blast the side of the wall, its head turns towards you, seeing the sudden movement, and as you do you aim up, aiming for the back of its head. You fire. This time the bullet strikes true, right into the back of its throat. You can see now (explosion noise) the blowout which is a small hole in the back of its throat, you can see the cavern behind it and a little bit of light that is peeking through. It (groans) and just (impact) falls across the ground here. The Eyebite spell no longer effective but it is, currently, still there, holding the area.

LIAM: (muffled) I'm still in here.

MATT: Yep, you feel it (impact) collapse on the ground and it's not moving and the muscles go lax around you.

LAURA: That's good, so you can move a little bit.

MATT: It's now Grog's turn.

TRAVIS: I can't go get him, though, 'cause the other dick lord is still on the map.

LIAM: (muffled) I'm in acid in here.

TRAVIS: I can't get to him. I'll run up to the dead earthworm and try and cut Vax out of his stupid stomach. With Craven Edge.

MATT: As you rush up, leaping onto the body of the now-deceased purple worm, you bring the blade up and begin carving through. Go ahead and I'll say you manage to, over the course of this round, you don't have to roll for it. You just begin to tear through it with the blade repeatedly, gashing it open until eventually you can feel the blows from the outside.

TRAVIS: Did I just help midwife Vax out of this thing?

MATT: Just a moment. I would like you to go ahead and make an attack roll with disadvantage.

LAURA: An attack.

TRAVIS: 20.

LIAM: Hits!

MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

LIAM: I mean, I'm unconscious.

MARISHA: You're unconscious?

LAURA: Well, he will be once he takes his damage.

TRAVIS: 17.

LIAM: Unconscious–

MATT: 17, so, as you strike through you feel yourself hit something else within the purple worm, and as the wound opens up, you can see Vax's bleeding, unconscious form slip out of the purple worm's body, onto the ground of the icy cavern.

TRAVIS: Ew.

LAURA: You just killed my brother.

LIAM: I'm unconscious.

MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

TRAVIS: It was only one– it was a couple of strikes to get him out, right?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: Yeah, that ends it.

MATT: All right.

(laughter)

SAM: Killed Vax.

MATT: That was your saved attack. Now, finishing that turn, Scanlan, you are up.

SAM: Ah, me? oh. Hello, hello. (laughs) I will kill it with fire. Well, let's see, can I see Vax over there in the worm juice?

MATT: No, not from your position. As far as you know, he's still been swallowed.

SAM: Then I'll kill it with fire. I will use my Wand of Fireballs to blast balls at it.

TALIESIN: Your balls of fire wand.

SAM: My balls of fire, and I won't hit Key, will I?

MATT: Currently, if you aim it properly. It's a big radial spell.

LAURA: Oh no, it's going to get Keyleth.

SAM: Oh, it's that radius!

MATT: Yes. You could aim it in such a way–

SAM: Forget it, I'll just do Lightning Bolt instead.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: That's a huge radius.

MATT: Fireball's a powerful, dangerous spell, if things are in close quarters, but against mass amounts of enemies, it's brilliant.

SAM: So I take two steps to my right, so no one else is in the line and I will lightning it instead.

MATT: All right. Go for it, go ahead and roll damage.

SAM: 8d6, yeah?

MATT: Yep, that is an 11 on its dexterity saving throw. Full damage.

SAM: 31.

MATT: 31 points of lightning damage to it. All righty! As you step to the side, releasing the bolt of lighting energy, it blasts into the front of its face. You can see one of its jaw mandibles gets torn off from part of the impact, you can see now the deep red blood begin to pool on the side of its face and drip down as it looks over, whipping its head in your direction.

SAM: (whimpers) Do I still have any movement?

MATT: Yeah, you only moved ten feet, so you still have 15 more feet.

SAM: I'm going to try to shuffle back into the tunnel there a little bit. And for my bonus, I'll Healing Word myself.

MATT: Go for it.

SAM: Okay, what is that, d4? Great, yeah, six points. Awesome.

MATT: All right, that finishes Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at the big icy worm.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: I'm just going to take two normal, everyday shots because things have been weird. It's got to be close to death now. That's 17.

MATT: 17 just barely hits.

TALIESIN: And 24.

MATT: Okay, both hit.

LAURA: Get it, Percy!

MATT: Your pistol now needs to be reloaded.

TALIESIN: Yes. Well, that's my third– Third attack is to reload. I keep track, I'm good. 21 points of damage.

MATT: Good. (gun firing twice) Both shots go off, (click) the third one kind of clicking. You go to reload, you can see both blast across the front of its body, leaving little reddish dots on its midsection as each bullet sinks into it. It's still standing, still writhing about. You can see it's bleeding from many different wounds and it's not looking too great, but it's still standing. Stay where you are or you going to–?

TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm staying where I am.

MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

MATT: All righty!

LAURA: And I'm going to shoot two arrows at him. Because what else am I going to do? Oh, Pike can help you.

TRAVIS: He's unconscious; don't listen to that piece of shit.

LAURA: I can't tell what happened; Grog went to save you.

LIAM: Huh? Oh, yeah.

LAURA: 29 on the first hit.

MATT: 29 hits.

LAURA: And 27 on the second hit.

MATT: Both hit.

LAURA: Okay. 20 on the first hit.

MATT: Nice.

LAURA: 18 on the second hit.

MATT: Got it. Both arrows (impacts) sticking into its side, you can now see multitudes of the shafts sticking out. It's still standing. It's a hardy, hardy creature. You want to move or you want to stay where you are?

LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am.

MATT: Okay. That's all right, ends your turn. Trinket's still sitting there wanting to help, but not able to do anything. All right.

SAM: So you mean, Trinket is doing what Trinket always–

LAURA: Shut up!

(laughter)

MATT: Pike screams out, “Vax!” and runs up the body, climbs up to the top and jumps off, landing next to your unconscious self. Reaches down and is going to use her one 6th-level spell, Heal.

MARISHA: Ooh!

MATT: So you immediately regain 70 hit points.

LAURA: Whoa!

TRAVIS: It's like Pulp Fiction with the adrenaline shot.

MATT: Clerics, man! You come to consciousness, taking the deep breath– The cold air from the cavern that you inhale stings your lungs, and you look over and Pike's there before you, eyes wide. Goes from a serious frown and a worried, furrowed brow to a big smile as you come back to consciousness. “Vax!” as she goes and hugs you.

LIAM: And I clap my hand here and I leave a big, gory, slimy smear right on the half of her face. Thank you, Pike.

MATT: So you're back up, that finishes her round. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: We are still hungry! And I rush up to giant dick smear.

MATT: Leaping over– (grunt, running sounds)

TRAVIS: And I would like to use reckless attack on my first of all three great weapon master.

MATT: Okay. You can use them all. All of them are affected now.

TRAVIS: Let's do that.

MATT: All right! So, advantage on all of your attacks.

TRAVIS: That's a 23.

MATT: Hits.

TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. What's 29 minus five? 24.

MATT: Hits.

TRAVIS: That probably–

LAURA: That hits, too.

TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got to do the math. 22.

MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

TRAVIS: Okay. 12. 20, plus ten, 30 for the first one. Eight. 13. 21, 31 for the second one.

LAURA: Grog, you've never been so hot!

TRAVIS: Three, eight, 16, 26 for the third one.

MATT: 26. How do you want to do this?

TRAVIS: I'd like to take Craven Edge and jump up, straight up, as high as I can and drive it straight into the top of its cavity and just drag it down and open it up like a beautiful bouquet.

MATT: As you see Grog staple himself to the top of this now-standing, 20-25 foot tall creature, he, using his barbarian strength to leap up on the top, sinking the blade into the back of its head. Immediately it rears back, its whole back arching. As it does so, you just use the heft of your weight, grinning as you drive the blade down the entirety of its body. As you grind down to the surface, you can see its armored back just pop open, like a freshly cooked sausage– just the insides spill out onto the ground. By the time Grog reaches the ground, you are coated in thick, thick crimson. Strangely enough, even though the blood is liquid, you feel almost like this crystalline force, like there are actually ice crystals within the blood stream itself from the cold that emanates from its body–

TRAVIS: Like Icy Hot.

MATT: Yes! And as you land and hit the ground, its body slaps forward, barely missing Keyleth as it wet hits the ground. Almost like a shrimp that had its entire back torn open. It's just in two pieces face down on the ground. Right there.

MARISHA: Good work, Grog.

TRAVIS: I want more. Who's next?

LIAM: Shh!

LAURA: Calm down, Grog! Calm your tits, Grog!

TRAVIS: Can I look in the blade and go: that was good, wasn't it?

MATT: “You did good, my friend. Very, very good.”

MARISHA: Hi, Grog.

SAM: Who you talking to, Grog?

TRAVIS: That was good, wasn't it?

MARISHA: It was very good, yeah! You did good!

TRAVIS: Well, fucking answer me next time, Jesus!

SAM: Sorry!

LIAM: I speak quietly into the earring and say: could everybody shut the fuck up, please, and can we get out of here? Quietly?

LAURA: No! There's gold! There's lots of gold on the other side!

LIAM: Yeah, let's call another two worms, let's do that.

SAM: These are probably the only ones! It's a male and a female!

MARISHA: How do you know that!?

LIAM: They fucking hated each other. They hated each other!

MARISHA: Yeah! They were trying to kill each other!

SAM: Yeah! They were married! They're a married couple! They hate each other!

MARISHA: Scanlan, that's only your relationships!

LAURA: Scanlan, you're right there. Get as much gold as you can and Dimension Door over to the teleporter.

SAM: I'm here? What?

LAURA: You're right by the gold!

SAM: Oh you mean, I'm going to get the gold?!

LAURA: Get the gold and Dimension Door!

SAM: I don't have a Bag of Holding! I weigh 14 pounds! I can't hold that much gold! Gold is heavy!

TRAVIS: I can get over there. Do we want gold?

SAM: Yes, we want fucking gold! Wait, isn't there gold all over the place?

MATT: It's like smatterings of single pieces across the floor, but this one tunnel, the hoard itself is pouring into the tunnel left behind.

LAURA: I need it!

TALIESIN: Go grab the gold, let's get the body, and we'll get out of here. We have to search the body as well.

TRAVIS: I run over to the gold. I run around the worm and run to the gold. And I (yelling) frenzied rage-loot this shit!. Just hacking away at it!

MATT: Slapping the stone and pouring all the rest of the gold you can get your hands on inside this–

SAM: I'll assist. Grog, Grog! Open the bag! (singing) Bigby's Hand will grab the gold.

(laughter)

LAURA: Yes! Oh my gosh, get so much gold!

MATT: Giant scoops into the Bag of Holding. It's just pouring off the sides of it onto the ground and you're having to scoop it back up inside.

MARISHA: I take out like my little filet knife and I start going to town on the frost worm in front of me, trying to salvage anything that I can from him.

MATT: Okay!

LAURA: I call Trinket and I tell him to get over by the teleportation circle.

MATT: Make a nature check real fast.

MARISHA: My book! I got my book!

SAM: Who, me? Nature check?

MARISHA: It's me. I got my book, which gives me advantage.

LIAM: I'm meeting Trinket, and I'm going to lay-slash-nap on his back.

MARISHA: 29.

LAURA: And I'm going to run as fast as I can over to where I can see them hoarding the gold, because I want to see it.

MATT: All right. You get over there pretty quick.

TALIESIN: I'm going to check the frozen body.

MATT: Okay. As Keyleth checks, you check the frozen body.

TALIESIN: Is that the dead man?

MATT: Oh. oh! The frozen man. Okay. Keyleth. You take a moment to cut through and there's the other undamaged mandible, the eye appears to be undamaged but those are all going to be very careful, time-intensive things to remove properly. There isn't much that can really be pulled from this other than that. There's not a whole lot of material on–

MARISHA: Can I vial any of the blood?

MATT: You can bottle some of the blood, yeah.

MARISHA: Yeah, I want to do that.

MATT: Okay, so you bottle some of the blood–

MARISHA: And I'm going to take that mandible if I can.

MATT: Okay, so you remove a mandible. So you can mark that down. All right, so you guys are gathering money.

TRAVIS: We don't have anything to store it in, really.

LAURA: Can I try to get some of the icy armor off of the big worm that's right next to me now?

MATT: You step up to it. I mean, most of the armor–

LAURA: I just want to pull on it and see if I can get some of it.

MATT: The parts that you pull on, that are like big hefty chunks that would be of any real use, are part of its body. The few that are busted from the damage you dealt to it throughout the combat, they're such small pieces and they crumble at your touch.

LAURA: It's okay, I'm more interested in gold anyway.

TALIESIN: Is it possible to move the frozen man, or is he just really stuck in there?

MATT: You go ahead and you grab onto him, and he's actually frozen to a coat of ice that is left in there, and looking at the ice pattern, you get the sensation that that frost worm may have frozen him in there, had seen him previously and, unable to reach him within the very back of that alcove, just frost breath-ed, this one or another like it did so.

TALIESIN: Keyleth! Can I borrow you over here?

MARISHA: Yeah. What do you want?

SAM: Are your hands dripping with blood right now?

MARISHA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Can you warm him up and see if we can get him out of here?

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, so you begin to slowly–

MARISHA: We were trying to do this before. We were trying to melt his face because Pike was going to do a talk to dead spell.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: We know what happened to him now, though.

LAURA: Yeah, we've got to get out of here.

MATT: So, anything else you want to do?

MARISHA: Well, I guess we're taking the body? I'll focus my heat on his feet so we can just dislodge him and throw him over our shoulder and go.

MATT: Okay. The ice slowly begins to melt, you gather you probably have another five to ten minutes before he'll be free.

TRAVIS: That's pretty long. Too long.

LAURA: Yeah, if we feel anything, let's go, okay. Got the gold? Let's go. Let's go.

MATT: You're still gathering gold, it's going to take you a while to get all this, it's a lot of– it's a small opening–

TRAVIS: Do we leave the cave or do we use the teleportation circle?

LAURA: Teleportation circle.

MARISHA: How much time is it going to take them to get the gold?

MATT: Probably, to get all of it? Another probably 15 minutes or so.

LAURA: Jeez.

MATT: Because you have to like get in the cavern and pull out chunks, so it's a big hoard.

MARISHA: How about this, let's spend five minutes doing all this stuff and see where we're at.

LAURA: He's rolling, he's rolling!

MARISHA: Son of a bitch, we should go.

MATT: As you're having this conversation, the ground begins to quake and you can just see–

ALL: Go! Run run run!

SAM: It could be an unrelated seismic event.

LAURA: Scanlan, run!

MATT: All right, as you all rush around the corpses, heading towards the teleportation circle, you–

SAM: I smack myself with Bigby's Hand.

MATT: Giving yourself a lift as you're pushed along over the course, you guys rush over to the teleportation circle, right as you hear the ground erupt about 30 feet behind you.

LAURA: Oh, shit!

MATT: In a very similar fashion as the initial arrival of the worm, and you hear a similar shrieking sound.

LAURA: Slow-motion turn around, is it a purple one or a blue one?

MATT: It is another purple worm. A larger one. Immediate comparison? You get the idea, and as you were tearing it apart– Both of these were adolescent. They weren't fully grown.

TALIESIN: Run!

TRAVIS: Must go faster. Must go faster.

MATT: All of you guys rush onto it, one after the other, onto the teleportation sigil, the sigil carrying each of you back to your destination before the purple worm can reach you in time, you all now find yourselves standing in the room beneath the house that previously belonged to Krieg, safe, with as much gold as you could carry in the time period you had.

LAURA: Which is a good amount, I have a feeling.

MATT: We'll come back to that in a minute, but first we're going to take a little break for the restroom, guys. So we'll see you back here real fast, we'll make this a quick break, and see you soon.

TRAVIS: Five minutes. Five minutes. Don't leave.

MATT: Bye, guys.
Break

[break]
Part II

MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. Returning, as the party calms down after the harrowing encounter with a couple of worm-based entities. What would you like to do?

MARISHA: Sorry about that whole cloud mist thing, you guys. I was trying to–

LAURA: We almost died.

MARISHA: Yeah. Sorry about that. Thanks, Vex.

TRAVIS: That was you?

MARISHA: Look, it was something new, I'm still working out the kinks, all right?

LAURA: Don't do it again. Not in combat.

MARISHA: I'm working out the kinks. I'm sorry. It'll be really cool next time I try it.

LIAM: 20. Anything left? Or is it just where I, we–

MATT: Same setup where you left it, but the same pattern to escape that you recall from before.

LIAM: There were traps left still. Still the same, all right.

MATT: Still the same pattern, so you guys all, thankfully, due to Vax's viselike memory, follow the path through the tiles to avoid the traps that are set entering that room. You make your way back up the stairs to the gallery room that contained the tapestries, the domino set, the gold tea set, the skull with the gem, all those things.

TALIESIN: I say we grab the tea set and the skull and take them to Lady–

LAURA: Dr. Dra?

TALIESIN: No, actually, maybe we should have it identified first.

LAURA: Right. That would be smart. What are we going to get– are we doing– wait. Here's a question I have. Do we have to give Dr. Dra the portion of what we found down there? Because technically it's not in the house. Technically. So, whatever we find in the house is what we give him a percentage of, yes? Yes?

SAM: Technically, he's not an honorable man. But we should be.

LAURA: Right, and honorably, it is truthful to say that we didn't find it in the house. Technically, it's across the fucking world.

TRAVIS: That's true. Give him a bit of the tea set, we give him the dominoes–

LAURA: They tried to steal our money, Scanlan, and you're letting them have free rein in our house right now.

SAM: It's their nature.

MARISHA: I'm still really confused as to why we came back here to begin with.

SAM: We were checking it out to see if it was safe.

MARISHA: Right, well, that's been confirmed, it's not.

LAURA: Right? We found the owner of the house, and he's been frozen.

SAM: Should we report this to the officials and try to quarantine the house, destroy it, something?

TALIESIN: I think that would be wise.

MARISHA: Quarantine the house?

SAM: Just destroy the portal, destroy the teleportation circle.

TALIESIN: Certainly can't have anyone else moving in here.

LAURA: We should take it for ourselves. Just to keep it safe.

SAM: Take the gold, or the house?

TRAVIS and LAURA: The house.

LAURA: We should let Emperor Uriel know that we should take control of this house because it contains very powerful secrets.

TALIESIN: We should find out what that skull does.

SAM: What does Pike think about that?

MATT: Pike? Hearing this conversation and still glad that everyone survived this end of this whole circumstance, goes: “Well–”

(laughter)

MATT: “I mean, we should let Uriel know.”

TALIESIN: I can't look at him.

MATT: “But we also made a deal. And we're people of our word.”

LAURA: Yes, Pike, we made a deal for anything we found in the house.

SAM: Don't condescend to Pike.

LAURA: I'm not condescending Pike, I am rationalizing this agreement.

MARISHA: I'm still really confused as to why we are trying to maintain honor to inhonorable people.

SAM: Because we're better than that.

LAURA: I'm going to tell him you said that.

TRAVIS: Yeah, why do we care if they have money?

SAM: Let's count our money first before we make that decision. But I'm mainly concerned what Pike feels about taking control of this evil, evil house.

LAURA: It's not evil, evil. It's not an evil house.

SAM: It's got an evil, mysterious gem-eye looking at us right now.

LAURA: Well, exactly, it's got secrets. We have a house that has powerful secrets in it, that people shouldn't be in. I'm saying we should claim it so that we can keep other people from falling victim.

SAM: All right. If in claiming it we can get someone, some sort of religious person in here to clear it for us, making sure that it's– Pike would be an option.

MARISHA: How is this going to sound to Uriel? Excuse me, Uriel, just want to let you know that we broke into General Krieg's old house and found out it's really dangerous. Can we have it?

LAURA: No, we just say– Keyleth, really?

MARISHA: Well, I'm just saying, how do we phrase this?

LAURA: You think that's how you would phrase it? You'd say: we heard rumor that the owner of the house had gone missing. We went to investigate and discovered very powerful, dangerous secrets within. We know where he is. He's frozen on the other side of a portal. We need to make sure nobody else falls victim to it. So we close off the house and we say we'll keep it safe. For the time being.

MARISHA: And what happens when he asks why we were there in the first place?

LAURA: We tell him we heard that somebody went missing and we were investigating where he went.

TRAVIS: That makes sense to me.

LIAM: We've probably earned a bit of trust at this point.

LAURA: What, we have to go through his guard? No. We're part of the council.

MARISHA: I don't know

LAURA: I think it's a very fair– Percy?

TALIESIN: I would agree. I don't think it's necessary for us to claim ownership for it. We just need to have it cordoned off and make sure no one else, other than us, can come in.

LAURA: Exactly. I'm not saying it's ours. I'm saying we just make sure no else comes in.

SAM: We're leasing with an option to buy.

TRAVIS: Is the skull with the gem in there still?

MATT: It's still turned away, and I believe you put a tapestry over it.

LAURA: Yes, we did.

TALIESIN: Let's bundle it up in the tapestry.

LIAM: That thing is trouble, though, that thing is trouble

TALIESIN: Well, let's take it to somebody who–

SAM: Take the skull?

TALIESIN: I think we should take the skull and show it to someone who might know what it is.

TRAVIS: All right, I go over and grab the tapestry and the skull, hold it like a knapsack.

MATT: Okay, make– no this is fine, it's relatively light.

TRAVIS: Can you hear me?

TALIESIN: Yes, Grog, we can hear you.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Right, good, maybe–

SAM: Oh shit, the whispers. If you haven't read the comics, check it out on geekandsundry.com.

TALIESIN: And while you're there, spend some money at Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Gilmore's, where all of your magical items can be procured. With a smile a week.

LAURA: (laughing) That was the lamest slogan ever.

MARISHA: All of your items can be purchased.

TALIESIN: I'm exhausted.

TRAVIS: Shut the fuck up! Wait, wait, wait. Last part, last part, last part.

SAM: And don't forget!

TALIESIN: Don't forget?

SAM: If someone's whispering in your ear, it's probably the sound of your conscience saying: “Go buy a T-shirt!”

TRAVIS: I take off running out of the house.

MATT: As you guys are having this conversation, Grog just bolts out of the house. Just runs up the stairs, out through the foyer, and is–

LAURA and TALIESIN: Grog!

LIAM: I start running after him, and I'm hasted.

MARISHA: Oh, it's reverse whispering!

TALIESIN: It's the reverse whisper!

SAM: Guys, this is the rest of the show.

TALIESIN: They're not talking, there's just tongues in ears.

LAURA: (laughs) Lalalala.

MARISHA: Wet willie.

LIAM: I'm running out stealthing, after him.

LAURA: I stop and I get the golden tea set. And I take off after him.

TRAVIS: (yelling) Guys, you've got to come out of the house, now!

TALIESIN: Okay, we're running out of the house.

TRAVIS: We've got to get out of the house. Now!

TALIESIN: We're running out of the house.

MARISHA: Okay, okay. We're running out of the house. Christ.

TALIESIN: I'm following him out of the house, so.

MATT: Right. You all rush out. You're now out of the foyer. You burst out the front of the home itself. You're in the front yard at this point in time, in the slightly dead grass.

TALIESIN: It's going to go Poltergeist on us, isn't it?

MARISHA: The house just collapses.

MATT: The sun's still high in the sky, late afternoon at this point.

LAURA: What the fuck was that about?

TRAVIS: The house and the skull are linked. As long as the house stands, his evil will grow.

SAM: Whose evil?

TRAVIS: It didn't say. The house has to be taken down to the ground. The portal must be destroyed.

LIAM: Says who? Who's in there?

TRAVIS: (loud and angry) I just heard this fucking– (calmer, hesitating) I. Have… premonitions at times, it runs in my family.

MARISHA: Since when, Grog?

TRAVIS: You know, when I'm drinking ale, this voice goes like: “Stop!” But I'm like: “No.” And I keep going. And sure enough, I should've stopped.

MARISHA: But you haven't been drinking today.

SAM: That voice is usually me.

TRAVIS: Are you saying anything?

MATT: Grog. Make a deception check.

TRAVIS: 12.

MATT: I'm going to say, over the course of everyone listening, Grog hasn't been really fancy with wordplay or deception. He's a very blunt, upfront person, and it's very awkward to see a childlike mind attempt to convey a fictional story like the one he's been pretending.

LAURA: So, you're lying.

TRAVIS: What?

LAURA: You're lying, Grog.

TRAVIS: What? Why do you say that?

TALIESIN: Because you're really bad at it. And it's hilarious.

TRAVIS: Reverse psychology. I'm really bad at it.

LAURA: Yes, you are.

TRAVIS: That didn't work.

TALIESIN: No, it didn't.

LIAM: I want to walk right up to Grog. Right up to his nipples, because that's as high as I go.

SAM: Kiss him on the mouth.

(laughter)

LIAM: That's two episodes from today. Will you come down here, please? Big Man? Couple of things. First, and this is a smaller detail, I shaved half your beard, correct? It's correct. You've cut me open at least twice, right now. Pike, come here.

MATT: Pike walks up. “Yeah?”

LIAM: I would say that makes you and I even. You've been acting all kinds of fucked-up for a while now, and I know you don't want to disappoint her, your best friend. Something's going on with you, and it's time to talk about it. You're talking to yourself, you're talking to your own asshole. You're talking to that fucking sword, you're talking to trinkets we're picking up in houses. What is going on?

TRAVIS: Talking to the sword?

LIAM: And she's listening. And she knows when you're lying, and she knows when you're telling the truth.

TRAVIS: Pike?

MATT: She does give you this concerned look that only a possibly disappointed friend can give you, like, “I am worried about you, Grog.”

TRAVIS: Honestly, I'm hurt. I'm offended. And we are not fucking equal. If you want to get equal, we can step out here, and handle business like men.

MARISHA: Who all is around to see this?

TRAVIS: I've cut you open twice. Twice.

LIAM: I walk away. I walk off. I leave the fucking house.

LAURA: We're already out of the house.

MATT: So as you guys are standing in front of the house, Vax just steps out into the center of the Cloudtop District, in the direction towards the exit.

LIAM: Gone. Stealthed. Laters.

TRAVIS: Pike, can I talk to you for a second?

MATT: “Yeah. Grog, anything.”

TRAVIS: (scoffs) Talking to my sword. The skull has a voice.

MATT: “What do you mean?”

TRAVIS: Yeah. I picked it up, right, because I was just going to carry it out, and it said, like: “I can grant you a wish. Any wish that you want.”

MATT: “We've been told something similar before, and that didn't go too well. Put the skull down, please.”

TRAVIS: Yeah. But it's a wish. We can wish for anything.

MATT: “Grog, please, trust me? Put the skull down.”

TRAVIS: I don't want to put it down.

MATT: “I know. Do you trust me?”

TRAVIS: Yes.

MATT: “Put the skull down, Grog.”

TRAVIS: I drop the skull.

MATT: Okay. The tapestry clatters to the ground and opens up, and the skull rolls for a second and stops on its side. You can see now, the golden skull is just resting there. The gem still with the intricate filigree, buried within the eye socket. Pike turns to the rest of you and calls you over. “We don't know what this is. And dangerous magics are drawn to imagery like this. Let us see what this is about, first.”

MARISHA: Pike, can you discern what kind of entity this might be attached to?

MATT: “I had a feeling before.” And she pulls out her healing symbol and casts Detect Good or Evil again in the direction of the skull. You can see she recoils the moment that she concentrates. “The aura is definitely evil from this object.”

MARISHA: Okay.

LAURA: Maybe it was lying to you.

SAM: What?

TRAVIS: Lying? I hadn't thought of that.

MARISHA: Is that all you have, Pike? That's all you can find out?

MATT: “You have to take it to somebody who knows it or spend some time with it, perhaps.”

LAURA: How about this, how about nobody ask the skull any more questions?

MARISHA: Yeah, no one touch the– Is it just laying on the floor right now?

MATT: Just laying right there, off to the side.

SAM: Put it in the Bag of Holding?

LAURA and MARISHA: No.

LAURA: I don't like evil things in the Bag of Holding. We have lots of weird things in there, I don't know how it'll react.

TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out my sword and pick it up by the eye socket.

MATT: The empty one? Okay. You lift it up.

TALIESIN: I'm going to carry it on a stick.

LAURA: Should we put a cloth over it?

SAM: Yeah, that might look a little weird.

TALIESIN: It's going to look weird with a cloth over it, but please, go ahead.

MATT: Okay. Vex, as you approach it and go to throw the cloth over it, you get a brief view of the gem that's in the socket. And where there was a slight shimmer to its surface when it was looking to before, you can now see briefly what looks like some sort of a ghostly face appears across the surface for a second and then fades.

LAURA: Oh, shit.

MATT: You throw it over it.

LAURA: That thing's alive. That is definitely alive.

TRAVIS: What, the skull?

LAURA: No, no, no. There's definitely something in that stone. It looked at me.

SAM: Well, that's creepy. Can we take it to someone; who do we know? Not Gilmore, this is beyond–

LAURA: Allura? She's not here, she's–

MATT: Allura's in Whitestone right now.

SAM: If only we had some way to magically transport to Whitestone.

TALIESIN: We do actually have a way of magically transporting to Whitestone.

SAM: Yes. We do. Could you go?

LAURA: Oh. Just one of us though.

SAM: Yes, you.

LAURA: Can you transport items with it?

TALIESIN: As long as they're on you, as long as you're holding them.

MARISHA: But Percy, to be fair, you've had a bit of a weakness with, you know, evil entities being attached to you.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Besides, if it grants a wish. I get the fucking wish.

LAURA: You get the wish, Grog, you sure get the wish.

MARISHA: No, it's not going to– It's not granting anyone's wish.

SAM: We could send Pike with it?

MARISHA: I mean, if want to sleep a day, we can all just bamf back. We can tree stride back to Whitestone, if we want to take a nap.

LAURA: That's true.

SAM: Wait, we're going to sleep with this skull in our house?

MARISHA: Well, I've already spent my one 6th-level spell turning us into fucking clouds.

SAM: You didn't turn me into a cloud.

LAURA: Or me.

MARISHA: Yeah. Honestly, if I would've turned everyone into a cloud–

TALIESIN: We'll keep it locked in my workshop for now. We can make it a night. And we will make sure that they know we have to deal with the house.

LAURA: Okay.

MARISHA: Who has to deal with the house?

LAURA: I'm going to go speak to Uriel and see if I can tell him what just happened.

SAM: You by yourself?

LAURA: You can all come with me.

SAM: All right.

TALIESIN: I'll actually– I've got a great idea.

SAM: Oh. We'll leave the skull with Uriel.

TALIESIN: I'll take the skull to Whitestone, and I'll see you in the morning.

LAURA: No.

SAM: After you've been corrupted by it?

LAURA: How about we all go together to Whitestone?

TALIESIN: I was just thinking it'll be a way of getting the skull out of the house tonight.

LAURA: Yeah, but then it'll be in Whitestone.

SAM: We'll leave the skull in this house–

TALIESIN: That's a very fair point. We're not leaving– I don't think that's a good idea.

LAURA: No.

MARISHA: What, hang on, Grog. You were–

LAURA: Why did you run the skull out of the house?

MARISHA: Yes. Exactly.

TRAVIS: I told you. The house is evil. The portal has to be crushed.

SAM: Wait, that part's true?

MARISHA: The portal has to be crushed?

TRAVIS: It's an evil portal. Yeah.

SAM: Who told you that?

TRAVIS: The skull did.

SAM: Oh, in addition to the wish? Oh.

LAURA: I don't know. Maybe the skull was trapped in the house. Maybe it wanted to get out of the house.

SAM: It's like a genie.

TRAVIS: Don't look at me. I'm just the translator.

SAM: Oh, this is weird. We need some help on this.

MARISHA: Why was it talking through you, Grog? Why not Pike?

TALIESIN: I think we'll get answers from Allura.

MARISHA: If you can ask it questions, maybe we could ask it a few more questions?

TRAVIS: I'm okay with that.

SAM: No. It will hypnotize us and corrupt us.

TRAVIS: It's in a knapsack.

LAURA: I think we should hide it and then open it up when we're in front of Allura.

TALIESIN: That's fair.

MARISHA: What time is it?

MATT: Right now, it's mid-afternoon. Two, three o'clock in the afternoon.

TALIESIN: Let's let Uriel know what's happened.

SAM: We'll go on a quick pub crawl.

TALIESIN: I've got to get home and work on a few things, anyway. I've got a broken gun.

MARISHA: I guess I'll go with Percy and take the skull, and I'll make sure we put it somewhere safe in the keep, if you guys want to go talk to Uriel.

LAURA: Pike? Grog? What do you guys want to do?

TRAVIS: What do we want to do, Pike?

MATT: “I don't know. We wanted to go talk to Uriel.”

MARISHA: Do you want to come with us, Pike? Do you want to be with the skull, Pike, or do you want to go talk to Uriel?

MATT: “I should walk with you with the skull.”

TALIESIN: Yes, I think that would be best.

SAM: Before we all part ways, can we do a quick accounting of the gold?

LAURA: We can't just count it right here.

TALIESIN: We'll count it back when we're–

LAURA: Away from your friends, but back at the keep.

SAM: All right. Fair enough.

MATT: Okay. So, as you guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep with the skull, keeping it properly covered so you're not walking through the city with a giant gold skull at the end of a sword. You head towards the palace. You make your way through the front to the outer doors. The throne room is currently closed, and there is heavy guard up, and upon you approaching, “I'm sorry. Do you have business with Uriel?”

LAURA: Not at the moment.

MATT: “All right.”

LAURA: But we will, once you tell him that we're here.

MATT: “All right. Hold on.” He steps inside. The doors close. About two minutes pass. The guard comes back out. “I'm terribly sorry. Uriel currently is in a very heated discussion and cannot take guests at the moment. Would you like me to relay a message?”

SAM: Yes.

LAURA: Yes, but we would like to write it down first.

SAM: Actually, while you were gone– And I cast Friends on him. While you were gone, other guards came by and said we were clear to go in.

MATT: You can go ahead and make a deception check with advantage.

SAM: Natural 20.

MATT: He goes, “Other guards? Uriel himself just told me I can't let anyone inside.”

LAURA: Oh, they must have seen him right after you saw him.

MATT: “All right, fine.” And he opens the door. You guys walk in, and there you see the entirety of the rest of the Council of Tal'Dorei. You see Tofur Brotorus, you see Seeker Asum, you see– what the hell is his name? The other guy. Arbiter Brom. They're all gathered in this discussion. Uriel looks up immediately and says, “I'm sorry, we're not taking any–”

LAURA: We heard there was a council meeting.

MATT: “Technically, no, but yes, what is your business?”

LAURA: We're here because there's a council thing?

SAM: We're here to report a security concern of the utmost importance and urgency to you.

MATT: There's a long, internalized sigh. Not out of frustration, just more out of being lost in thought and a little sad. He goes, “All right. Very well.”

LAURA: Is everything all right, Uriel?

MATT: “Everything's fine. What would you like to bring to the council?”

SAM: Are we among friends here and free to talk in front of everyone?

MATT: He looks around. “These are my trusted advisors and my trusted palace guard. Yes.”

SAM: We've been alerted to some evil afoot in your kingdom yet again. The former Krieg's homestead has been vacant for a while and apparently has a portal to an evil realm inside. We went to investigate, acting on a tip from–

LAURA: An old friend.

SAM: Yes.

LAURA: And discovered that it was, in fact, true. The owner that was missing has been killed.

MATT: “So, Krieg's estate, which was sold off after his disappearance over a year ago, you're telling me contains some sort of evil portal.”

LAURA: Yes.

MATT: “Was this built by the new owner?”

LAURA: No, I believe it was built by Krieg.

MATT: “Built by Krieg? How are you certain of this?”

SAM: Our informant told us as much. We don't want to give his name.

LAURA: It seems rather old, this portal.

MATT: “Where is Krieg now?”

LAURA: I have no idea.

MATT: “All right. Well, we'll send a security force to keep a very close eye on the house while it is investigated.”

SAM: It's extremely magically dangerous. They should not set foot inside the place at all.

LAURA: Incredibly dangerous. It might be best if we investigate it ourselves.

MATT: “All right, if you'd like. I was going to wait until Allura returned and I was going to assign her to it, but if you feel confident, then I will leave the investigation in your hands.”

LAURA: Thank you.

SAM: Will you notify us when she returns?

MATT: “I will.”

SAM: Is there anything else?

LAURA: No. You all look quite lovely today, and we will leave you to your business.

MATT: Asum chuckles a little bit. The rest of them acknowledge, Tofor gives a nod, and Uriel closes his eyes for a second and rubs his temple and goes, “I appreciate the information. If you please, we have matters to discuss.”

SAM: Just real quick before we leave. I'm sorry. I think I had a burrito. Can I just use a facility inside? A restroom or something?

MATT: “Certainly.”

SAM: Thank you.

LAURA: I'll wait for him.

SAM: Just wait out of earshot.

LAURA: Far away.

MATT: “Thank you.” They wait as you guys leave the chambers. The guards close the doors, and you're welcome to go. There are a number of various WCs, water closets, throughout the palace.

LAURA: They closed the doors?

SAM: They closed the doors?

MATT: They're not going to let you crap in the middle of the throne room!

LAURA: No, but I thought I could wait in the back of the throne room, out of earshot.

MATT: The guards are pushing you out of the throne room. This is a very private meeting.

LAURA: Excuse me, handsy. I'm leaving.

MATT: “Sorry, Miss. Orders of Uriel.” They push you out and close the doors.

SAM: I've been in the throne room before?

MATT: You have been, yes.

SAM: Do you have eyes on them?

LAURA: No, they fucking shut me out.

SAM: All right. Give me ten minutes.

LIAM: Do you need a scroll?

SAM: I sit down on the WC.

MATT: Do you take your potion?

SAM: No, I don't. Instead, I Polymorph into a fly, and I'm going to fly my way to the throne room.

MATT: Okay. All right. You fly through, over to the doors. The front doors?

SAM: Of the throne room?

MATT: How are you getting into the throne room?

SAM: The doors are closed, yes?

MATT: Yes.

SAM: Is there any gap at all?

MATT: There is a slight gap on the bottom.

SAM: Okay, I'm going to crawl in there.

MATT: As you come by, one of the guards swings at you. You dodge out of the way without issue and make your way underneath the doors and raise your flight pattern.

LAURA: I start chatting up the guards on the outside of the door to distract them a little bit.

MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

SAM: Dexterity? Oh, no, someone's got a fly swatter! Ten?

MATT: Okay. As you cruise in for a moment, you can see the throne room itself, in its round pattern, has designs carved into the walls, almost like Celtic knots. There are a number of these designs right towards the sides of each entrance that previously just looked like a design, but they emit a dull glow for a second, and a burst of arcane energy comes out from them. You find your form immediately unfurl into that of Scanlan the gnome, which then plops back onto the ground, your Polymorph spell dispelled. All of a sudden, the talk stops and the entire council turns back towards the entrance as you're catching yourself on the ground.

LIAM: Surprise!

SAM: That one's full. The one that I tried to go into? It's full and it needs a big cleaning.

MATT: “Good to know, Scanlan.”

SAM: I thought there was another one this way.

MATT: “There isn't, Scanlan.”

SAM: Not through there, or anything? All right. Carry on, then. You should send someone up to service it, though, right away.

MATT: He looks over to Tofor, and Tofor goes–

SAM: It's a matter of security.

MATT: “We'll have it done. Thank you, Scanlan. Now, please.”

SAM: Okay. Two lefts and a right, and I'm out? Thank you.

LIAM: Matt's got to be using Botox, because he didn't move!

(laughter)

MATT: Yeah, you gather, due to recent events, that the magical defenses have been reinstated, with the current circumstances. The doors open again, and Vex, as you turn, you see Scanlan being led out of the doors.

LAURA: Scanlan, what are you doing here?

SAM: Shat all over my plans. Let's go home, I guess.

MATT: All right. You guys make your way back to Greyskull Keep. Vax is there, waiting.

LIAM: No, I'm not.

MATT: Oh, you didn't go back to the keep?

LIAM: Nope.

LAURA: I tell some guards on the way out just to block off that house and not let anybody in it. Don't go inside, on your life.

MATT: “Noted. The order just came through. Don't worry. We're gathering a troop specifically for this. Don't worry.”

LAURA: Not a lot of troops. Just a couple of dudes is good.

MATT: “Very well.”

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: As you're leaving, you can see there are a few armed individuals, four, approximately, that are moving towards the house to stand guard and inspect the exterior, at the very least. You return to Greyskull Keep. You guys get there, as well. Grog, you return on your own, essentially, at this point, unless you're walking with them with the skull. Vax is nowhere to be found. You do find that Dr. Dranzel, that whole team is gone, except for Zed.

SAM: The drummer?

MATT: Yes. Zed is currently having a little bit of ale in the dining room area, along with Jarett, who was assigned to watch over while they're at the keep. As you step inside, they all notice. Jarett, still with his crossbow loaded in his lap, though he's happy and jovial and conversational with Zed. “Ah, you've returned. Good to see all of you in good health. The rest have left into the city.”

SAM: Did they say why? For a performance?

MATT: Zed leans forward and goes, “Actually, it appears that Kaylie got in some sort of a serious bar tussle last night and is currently being held in the stocks. The stockade. I get those words confused. Stockade.” He takes a sip of his ale. The rest of the troupe's going to see if they can get her out.”

SAM: All right, good to know. Thanks, Zed.

LAURA: Jarett?

MATT: “Yes?”

LAURA: Any issues while we were gone?

MATT: “No issues, actually. They were good conversationalists. They were very aware of my disposition, and I kept a very close eye on any movement, preventing them from leaving the room unless they were as a group, except for their exit, in which Zed escorted me. There have been no problems.”

LAURA: Good man. I pat him on the shoulder.

TRAVIS: She's in the stockade. Only problem is getting caught. I like her style. Should we get her out?

SAM: I'd like to, very much, but I don't know how. We can't just barge in there and break someone out of jail. We're known people.

LAURA: Don't you have your sheriff badge?

LIAM: (laughs) Well-remembered.

TRAVIS: Yeah, can't we post a bond or something?

SAM: It's customs, not sheriff.

LAURA: Call the council.

MARISHA: Well, it sounds like they've already– they're sending other people to get her out. What's the big deal?

SAM: Yeah, but they could make the problem worse.

LAURA: Those guys? They'll make it worse.

SAM: She's quite special to me. I think we should– I think I should go and try to get her out.

MARISHA: Oh, she's 'quite special' to you, yeah?

TRAVIS: There's one place I haven't done it, and it's in a prison.

SAM: Not, not in that way.

(laughter)

SAM: That's creepy. No, not in that way.

MARISHA: Why is that creepy?

SAM: I'm not interested in her in that way.

MARISHA: But you were courting her two days ago.

SAM: Things have changed.

MARISHA: I thought she spent the night in your room.

SAM: She's a good person and she deserves much better than the likes of me–

TALIESIN: That's never stopped you before.

LAURA: Don't say that, Scanlan. You've got a cube!

MARISHA: That's true.

SAM: It's a rather large cube, but, listen, all right, she's– she's– we're related. We're related.

MARISHA: What?

SAM: And I don't just mean–

MARISHA: Wait, what?

SAM: She's a Shorthalt.

TRAVIS: Like a cousin?

LAURA: Like a sister?

MARISHA: Like an aunt?

TALIESIN: Like a mother?

SAM: Like a baby. Like a baby Shorthalt.

TRAVIS: Whose baby?

SAM: (high-pitched 'hee' sound)

TRAVIS: 'He'?

(laughter)

SAM: Listen, don't spread the word around. I don't want my cred to be ruined, but… she's my little girl.

LAURA: You dog!

TRAVIS: You're a baby daddy?

SAM: I didn't know this, this is new information. I'm still just adjusting to it.

TRAVIS: Holy shit!

MARISHA: You tried to sleep with your baby daddy?

SAM: No I didn't.

TRAVIS: Did you lock that up that night?

SAM: No, I did not! I did not try and sleep with her. I think deep down inside, some part of me knew, which is why I gave her all that gold. I think.

TRAVIS: You paid her for it?

SAM: No! Oh, Grog, please!

(laughter)

SAM: I may deserve that but no, no. It's not like that at all.

LAURA: Then you didn't know. There's no part of you that knew you had any children.

SAM: I mean, I always knew that was a possibility, in the trade I deal in.

MATT: At this point Zed breaks in and goes, (chuckles) “Indeed!”

SAM: All right. Easy. Listen, drummer–

MATT: “It's Zed.”

SAM: You can be replaced easily. When I played with them, we had seven drummers in two years. And I killed two of them.

(laughter)

MATT: He sets his drink down and pushes it away. “Should I go?”

SAM: No, just stay and shut up.

TRAVIS: I'll take that, though. I take his drink.

MARISHA: Oh, wow. Well, that's–

SAM: Yes, I don't quite know how to act or behave now. And I'm going through a crisis of conscience and identity. I'm sorry; I'm off my game right now. But she's related to me.

LAURA: Just make sure that she knows that you love her. And make sure that she knows that you're there for her.

MARISHA: Why do you keep saying she's 'related to' you? Why don't you just call her exactly what she is? Which is your daughter.

SAM: I don't know. Okay, all right.

MARISHA: That's weird to be like, 'my child is related to me.'

SAM: I'm not good with this stuff. I haven't done this before, all right? I haven't really had family for much of my life. And this is a new thing and it's going to take me some time to adjust and figure out what this means for me. All right? I've defined most of my life by the people I've slept with and now, this a new part of me that I have to figure out.

LAURA: Well, technically, it's still defined by–

TALIESIN: I was just thinking that. It's a redefinition.

LAURA: You could make a really good move of it by helping her get out of the stockade.

SAM: I would like to. But I'll need some help, probably. I don't know if we can all go barge in there.

LAURA: Trinket.

MATT: (bear grunts)

LAURA: Scanlan needs help

MATT: Trinket lumbers over to you and (slurp). Licks the side of your face. (bear groan) Leans into you. Nearly pushing you off your feet from the sheer mass.

SAM: (laughs) Thanks, Vex. Trinket, I'm okay for right now. But maybe you can help best by staying here and looking after the drummer here and making sure.

MATT: (growls) Just growls at Zed, who stands up. “I'm just here to make sure that we continue our deal when they return. I'm not– I don't– I just play the drums.”

LAURA: You do a good job of it. Keep drinking that ale.

TRAVIS: I give it back.

MATT: “I–” Takes the empty and goes and refills it from a nearby cask.

SAM: I know it's late in the day, but I wouldn't mind going right away. Does anyone want to join me?

TRAVIS: Do you want all of us? Or a smaller party?

SAM: Probably just a smaller party. Don't we have business to attend to here? Gold to count and–

LAURA: I can stay and count.

TRAVIS: I can stay with her.

MARISHA: Who do you want to take? You pick your dodgeball team.

TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

TALIESIN: Yes.

SAM: Well to get out of a stockade, we'll need some cunning. And cunning– And cunning.

TRAVIS: Go ahead and ask.

SAM: I wish Vax were here.

TRAVIS: Don't we have earrings?

SAM: You know what, we are but they have a range.

LAURA: They do have a range.

SAM: Come in, Vax. Earth to Vax. Tune in Tokyo.

MATT: Approximately where are you right now?

MARISHA: So many secrets!

MATT: I love the whispers!

SAM: He's gone to Whitestone!

MATT: All right, there is no response. He really is out of range.

SAM: Percy, I need you for your words, and Keyleth for your magic. Let's go.

MARISHA: All right.

LAURA: We're useless.

MARISHA: Can I heal myself up first?

SAM: Sure, if you've got a little left for me. Wait, I can give us–

MARISHA: Oh wait, Pike! Will you hook us up?

MATT: “Yeah,” And she goes over and–

TALIESIN: I'm going to try and do a quick repair to my gun, also.

MATT: Okay, go for it. She throws down a couple of Cure Light Wounds. She's going to do 3rd level to each of you.

MARISHA: Dope.

MATT: Of Cure Wounds. This'll be 3d8 plus five to each of you. So 23 to you, and 21 to you, Scanlan. She'll do a third one to you, Keyleth. Because you're looking pretty rough, right Keyleth?

MARISHA: Huh?

MATT: You're looking pretty rough?

MARISHA: I'm at 65 now, with that. So I'm still 30 under.

MATT: So on top of that you get another 13. Pike's going to stay with you guys.

LAURA: Oh, okay.

MATT: All right, so. While you guys count the gold and what you managed to gather, you find in the–

LAURA: Out of sight of Zed! Just so you know.

MATT: Not a worry. You manage to pull from the hoard entirely, out of gold, silver, copper, platinum, the equivalent of 4,150 gold pieces.

TRAVIS: Wow.

LIAM: There was another 20 or 30g there.

LAURA: I know, right?

LIAM: Probably.

SAM: We can go back.

MARISHA: How much? 4,000?

MATT: 4,150 gold.

TRAVIS: You don't want to go back in there.

MATT: About 1,050 gold worth of gems.

LAURA: 1,050.

MATT: Yep, in gems. Mark that. And about 750 gold approximately of art items, knick knacks, things that you would have to find a specific seller to really get the money for them.

LAURA: (singing) Knick knacks.

SAM: Tchotchkes.

MATT: Yeah, like small jade statues, bits of jewelry…

LAURA: And how much in platinum?

MATT: Well, the gold equivalent of platinum is what it would be. The total amount is 4,000. But nice try. All right, so. You guys make your way– After asking around a bit, you figure the closest stockade is the Promenade stockade.

SAM: Oh, there's multiple stockades.

MATT: There are. But that's the one that's closest to the keep and the first place you should start. So you make your way towards the Promenade stockade. It's a fairly grim-looking grey stone building on the outskirts of Abdar's Promenade, which is a very, very, bombastic, colorful gathering of tents and buildings and various shopkeeps. As you walk to the outside of it, approaching, you can see immediately, there on the steps, is most of Dr. Dranzel's troupe, just sitting on the outside steps with two guards at the door. And they're all talking amongst themselves, waiting outside. Dr. Dranzel is not amongst them. As you begin to step closer–

SAM: He got nabbed, too, didn't he?

MATT: (laughs) As you step closer, you can see they wave you down, and they recognize you and approach you with an excited look on their face as if they now have some sort of backup.

MARISHA: I'm going to whisper to Scanlan. I'm going to say, I'm going to stay back. You go ahead.

SAM: All right, thanks.

MATT: So Kent Plucker approaches you as you approach and goes like, “Scanlan. Good thing you're here. I think we may need your silvered tongue to go ahead and help us out in this endeavor. Dr. Dranzel's inside; he's been arguing with the warden for quite some time. We're trying to get Kaylie out.”

SAM: What happened? Why is she in jail?

MATT: “She got in a bit of a bar fight last night, it seems. Messed up quite a few gentlemen and all of them are arrested and being held inside. They're wanting a bit of change to do the damages and pay for the fine of whatever else she's done. And, well, we're not keen on really paying fines, so we're trying to see how much we can get out of this with our–”

SAM: What's the fine?

MATT: “I don't know. We didn't go in as a full group. The guards wouldn't let us.”

SAM: Was she injured in any way?

MATT: “I haven't seen her. You'll have to go inside to find out.”

SAM: All right. Thank you. You won't be needed here anymore. You guys can leave.

MATT: They all look at each other. “If it's fine by you, we're going to wait for Dr. Dranzel.”

SAM: Oh yes, all right. Percy.

TALIESIN: Yes?

SAM: What do you think our play is here?

TALIESIN: Well–

SAM: Should we go in and pay? Should we do a bit of a ruse? You still have your Hat of Disguise, right?

TALIESIN: Yes, but I think I'm more useful as myself, rather than anybody else.

SAM: Well, you could be a guard taking me in there.

TALIESIN: I think on a certain level, you're possibly making this more complicated than it needs to be.

SAM: Yeah, but it's fun, though? No, no, you're right, we should just go in and talk.

TALIESIN: You forget you have clout. Part of the point of clout is that you spend it. You spend your clout.

SAM: Oh, all right.

TALIESIN: I know you're not used to actually having the means by which to just simply get what you want by asking for it. But you could just… ask for it.

MARISHA: That was the most privileged thing you've ever said.

TALIESIN: That's the most privileged thing I've ever said that you've heard.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Touché.

LIAM: Marisha has a high clout score.

SAM: So you think just walk on in there. No subterfuge, no sneaky-sneaky, no breaking down doors?

TALIESIN: Well, a little subterfuge. Let me–

MARISHA: I've got Polymorph. I can always be a tiny thing in your pocket.

SAM: Who said that?

MARISHA: Sorry, I'm back here. I figured Percy and I were waiting back here.

SAM: Oh, okay, hi.

TALIESIN: Let me attempt to see if I can defuse this relatively easily. I will need some gold.

SAM: Are you lying to me to get me to pay you for a new gun?

TALIESIN: No, but that's a very good point. So later I will be asking for some gold to help me fix my new gun.

SAM: All right, I'll give you what you need.

TALIESIN: All right.

MARISHA: Do you have gold, Scanlan?

SAM: I do.

TALIESIN: Okay, we may have to have a discussion. At the very least I'm going to need 20 gold, at the very least.

SAM: 20?

TALIESIN: 20 gold, at the very least.

SAM: You don't have 20 gold?

TALIESIN: Oh, I do. Just not for your daughter.

SAM: Oh, Jesus.

(laughter)

SAM: Take 50.

TALIESIN: That will do.

MATT: So you guys approach?

MARISHA: No trips to Coldstone with Percy. You are not the Godfather.

TALIESIN: I will take you to White Castle, though.

MATT: You come to the front steps of the stockade, there are two guards there, with tower shields and what looks like halberds to each of them. One of them steps forward, putting his shield out. Not in an aggressive way, but definitely in an attention-gathering way. “Do you have business here in the stockade?”

TALIESIN: I do; I wish to speak to the warden.

MATT: “The warden is indisposed in conversation at the moment.”

TALIESIN: Well, he will agree to be indisposed in conversation with me. I'm Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. And I'm here on the business of Whitestone.

SAM: He's an ambassador.

MATT: Make a persuasion roll. I'll say with advantage due to the very, very, intense, believable stare of Scanlan backing you up.

TALIESIN: 19.

MATT: He gives a nod. “All right, but good luck.” The two guards open the doors, and as they do you can already hear raised voices shouting back and forth. Can't really make out the words, but as you step into the inside you can see there is a clerk's desk. With a clerk sitting there, keeping one ear closed as he's trying to write in a book. To the immediate right of them, there is Dr. Dranzel in an argument with a gentleman with a well-kept mustache, thick over the top lip, slicked black hair that curls up in the back in a small poof. He's wearing a breastplate and is standing with an appearance of self-importance. At which point, as you approach, Dr. Dranzel turns and goes, “Oh good. Someone with actual–”

TALIESIN: Shush! Who is this person?

MATT: Everyone gets quiet and the individual standing there goes, “Well apparently, he's the man who's bothering me. Hm?”

TALIESIN: What do you do, sir?

SAM: I just throw Dranzel a quick little wink.

TALIESIN: What do you do, sir?

MATT: “I'm a performer.” (slight chuckle)

TALIESIN: Excellent, he's a performer. You may leave, we have no need of you.

LAURA: (whispered) Oh, shit.

MATT: “Hmph.” He adjusts his hat and–

TALIESIN: Guard, escort the commoner out of the room.

MATT: The guards instinctively step up and take his arms and they lead him out. Dr. Dranzel, taken aback and the whole time he's looking at Scanlan with this look of like–

SAM: You heard the ambassador; please leave.

(laughter)

MATT: (boom) The doors close behind. The individual steps forward.

TALIESIN: Now that that's been taken care of, who is an authority that I may speak to?

MATT: “That, I'm afraid, would be me. (sly chuckle) Pleasure to meet you. I'm Warden Cyrus Hume. What is your name?”

TALIESIN: Cyrus Hume. I'm Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone.

MATT: “This does me no service.”

TALIESIN: It will.

MATT: “Hmph.”

TALIESIN: I am, of course, the newly appointed ambassador from Whitestone, and I have been brought down here because apparently you are holding one of my performers. A performer who is meant to be heading towards Whitestone in the next three weeks to perform for my sister.

MATT: “Describe your performer, sir.”

TALIESIN: Oh, small, plain, female. (dismissive sigh)

MATT: (sighs heavily) “I know of the one you speak. The same one we're arguing– I assume this other individual that just left is one of your performers as well.”

TALIESIN: Yes, he is. He is one of the official performers– they're supposed to be performing at the new coronation of a brand new temple in Whitestone. Much has been arranged, much has been paid for, and I don't want to explain any of this to the royal court.

MATT: Make a deception check.

TALIESIN: Casting– no, not yet. 13.

MATT: Okay. He goes–

TALIESIN: If you were to be agreeable to helping us move this along, I would remember the favor. Whitestone would remember the favor.

MATT: “Good. Well, listen. There are fines for damages, or she sits until tried. Now.”

TALIESIN: Damages?

MATT: “The damages to the Nervous Brook pub are estimated to be upwards of 450 gold pieces, and the fine for drunken battery and disturbing the peace amounts to 250 gold pieces. 700 total and I would gladly let you take that rabid dug-grubber off of my hands.”

SAM: You'll watch what you say about her.

MATT: “Oh, will I?”

TALIESIN: Shush, performer. Well, sir, I appreciate your candor, I appreciate the cut of your jib, and I appreciate that you are a man of honor and of your station. It is very, very rare to find someone who respects such things. Obviously the damages must be paid–

MATT: “If you wish to discuss it with the three in question–” He points to one of the cells on the other side of the room and you can see that there is a set of bars, and you can vaguely see what looks like the shape of a person who's just slumped in the cell. Mostly cast in shadow.

TALIESIN: Who are they?

MATT: “Bar patrons. And they're all worse for wear.”

TALIESIN: Do we know what happened?

MATT: “The dog has teeth. Three against one, if the stories say true. The bar patrons and the owner of the establishment all verified that she indeed started and finished it.”

TALIESIN: I don't care who started or finished it. Obviously, we will pay for the damages out of your troupe's pocket.

SAM: Your majesty, are you sure you don't want to write a check from the treasury?

TALIESIN: Quite.

SAM: I've got the checkbook with me. We could just write a check.

TALIESIN: We will write a check for our friend's pocket, but for the damages, I feel that some responsibility must be taken.

MATT: “I'm not familiar with this check you speak of. I deal in gold, as does Emon. What good does this do me in my station if I am to show up with a simple piece of paper?”

TALIESIN: He has a very fair point.

SAM: (whispers) Your brand of subterfuge is not what I had in mind.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: What good is subterfuge when there's such an opportunity to create a ballad? Some sort of ballad about a cautionary tale.

SAM: I could have picked anyone to be with me here. Not this. You're rubbing my face in it because I threw your gun in the lava.

TALIESIN: You chose so poorly. You chose so poorly. It is truly impressive how poorly you chose.

MATT: “Stop wasting my time, if you're going to retrieve this invalid, do so quickly.”

TALIESIN: You may come pick up your gold from Castle Greyskull in the morning. It will be waiting for you, of course, sir. In the meantime, here is 20 gold for your trouble. On top of the gold you will be expecting for all fines imposed.

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

TALIESIN: (high-pitched) One.

MATT: He rolled a natural 20.

TALIESIN: All right, bring it. Bring it.

MATT: “Well, I appreciate your attempt to maneuver around my station of which you hold so clear. You seemingly attempt to bribe a warden of the stockade in an attempt to retrieve what appears to be a relatively… How do I put it? Immoral, destitute and feral creature.”

SAM: Warden. This is just like this bastard. He always goes around trying to boss people around and throw his money around. And I turn and I punch Percy in the face.

MATT: Okay! Roll for an attack.

SAM: Oh, shit. Going for another one. A nine. Probably not.

MATT: Plus your strength modifier.

SAM: I don't have any strength. One, so that's ten.

MATT: Ten. Percy, do you take it?

TALIESIN: Yes, I take it.

MATT: Okay. Whack! A solid hit across the face. You have to lean into it and make it look more impactful than it really is.

TALIESIN: (overly dramatic) Oh!

SAM: And then I turn around, and I punch a guard.

LAURA: Oh my god.

TALIESIN: Where are you going with this?

MATT: Roll another attack.

SAM: 13.

MATT: 13. You whirl around, and one of the guards is rushing forward to try and break this up, and as you swing towards him, your fist collides with the side of his helmet. It definitely shakes him for a second. It doesn't do much in the way of damage, but it does kind of hurt your knuckles a little bit. Now the guard's like, (startled sound) and stumbles back a bit.

SAM: I've just had enough with all of you people. We performers demand respect and deserve it as well.

MATT: The warden's now stepped forward and put his hand on the side of his blade and says, “Am I to understand you walked in here and immediately struck a guard of the stockade?”

SAM: I've just had it up to here with being bossed around by people like him.

MATT: “Well, would it make you feel better if he's thrown in prison?”

SAM: It would.

TALIESIN: It would make me feel better if he was thrown in prison.

MATT: “Oh, don't worry. You'll both be going.”

MARISHA: About this time, I come over the earpiece and I go, how's it going in there, guys?

SAM: Great.

TALIESIN: Great. Everything's fine.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Good. Just let me know if you need me.

MATT: He looks to the side and two guards now, one of the ones that punched you and another one to the side both step up and are reaching–

TALIESIN: Won't it be unfortunate when you find out I have diplomatic immunity?

SAM: Diplomatic immunity.

MATT: You both have been manhandled and brought your hands behind. You feel manacles being pulled forth, and the warden's just looking down upon both of you.

TALIESIN: I blame you for this.

SAM: You should blame me for this. I'm sorry. I just had a really shitty day, all right? He doesn't deserve this. Let him go. Just take me.

MATT: “Very well. Now.” And you feel the release as the manacles come away. You are escorted out of the room. You are put in shackles, brought, and thrown into the same jail cell as Kaylie.

TALIESIN: All right. How much to get both of them out?

MATT: As you're being pushed out?

TALIESIN: Yeah. I'll bring it.

MATT: There's no answer at the moment. The doors close behind you, and you're thrust off of four steps. Make an acrobatics check.

MARISHA: They were tossing your ass out.

TALIESIN: 23.

MATT: All right. You manage to catch yourself with a small tumble over the shoulder, land Willy Wonka-style, well stuck. As you're thrown, you hit the ground. You can see off in the corner of the cell, Kaylie, arms crossed, sitting on the ground. She leans forward a little bit, and you can see the light hits the side of her face, and she has a bit of a welt there and a bit of a black eye, but she doesn't look too worse for wear.

TALIESIN: Now for the love of God, just wait until nightfall and Dimension Door out of there.

SAM: Did I hear that?

MATT: Yeah, you'd hear that.

SAM: Good idea. Thanks, Percy, for your help.

TALIESIN: You're welcome. Wait until nightfall.

SAM: Huh? Oh. All right.

MATT: As she leans forward, she goes, “Huh. Like father, like daughter, aye?”

SAM: You could say so. I heard you had quite a night last night at the bar.

MATT: “Hm. Felt good. I like breaking faces.”

SAM: Apparently you're very good at it. I saw– I got a glimpse of your victims over there.

MATT: (laughs) “They had it coming. Don't know why, but I had a feeling somewhere in their life, they probably deserved it. Most men do.”

SAM: Yep, you're right about that. Stay away from all men. Forever.

MATT: “They were fuckwits. Their faces were so punchable.”

SAM: I know that feeling. Listen, I've come to get you out of here.

MATT: (laughs) “Apparently you've not done that very well.”

SAM: Don't worry. I've still got some tricks up my sleeve. Just wanted to make sure you're all right. Did they hurt you in any way?

MATT: “Only one person's really hurt me recently.”

LIAM: Cold as ice.

MATT: “Look, Scanlan. Father. I spent a lifetime hating you. I'd imagined the moment we would finally meet for so long, planned it out in my head, had it all worked out. My idea of you, what you'd be like, what you'd say, and you know what? Up until last night, I was pretty spot-on. I don't know what I wanted. I have a lot to process, to think about. But I'd prefer not to do it in this dank cell, so if you have a way out, please, now's the time to do it.”

SAM: You think now? All right, is anyone watching?

MATT: There are two guards that are not watching directly, but they're muscled up against the bars and keeping an eye over the shoulder.

SAM: I'll need a distraction. Do you think you can come up with one?

MATT: Her eyes turn for a second and she goes, (chuckles) “I think that can be done.” She leans up to the side of the bar and peeks her head out for a second. Closes her mouth, cups it with her hand, and you start hearing from the opposite side of the room, through arcane ventriloquism, these three different male voices going, “I'll fuck you up!” You hear punches and you hear all of this screaming and chaos. At which point, the two guards look over. One of them gives the other a motion, and they both run off to see the other side of the room. She looks back at you.

SAM: You'll have to teach me that trick. And then I Dimension Door us out onto the street.

MATT: As you reach for her, she still pulls away a little bit, but you still grab hold and (poof) puff of smoke. You guys (magic sound) appear outside, landing a couple of feet above the ground and catch yourselves. You're off to the side of the stockade where it meets with one of the nearby walls. No one seems to immediately notice you, other than a couple of people that are walking down the street that see two individuals appear out of the ether and land onto the ground.

SAM: All right. Let's get out of here. Percy, I didn't wait quite until nightfall.

TALIESIN: I assumed you wouldn't. We're already walking back.

SAM: All right, we'll catch up.

MATT: You guys head back towards Greyskull? All right.

MARISHA: I'm glad I came in handy for that field trip.

SAM: Oh, shit! Burn it down! Burn the stockades down!

LIAM: I'd also like to point out that Grog's single nut-flick did more damage than your two full-on punches.

(laughter)

MATT: This is true! All right. Eventually, you guys make your way back. As you do, you gather, and about five minutes behind you, the rest of Dr. Dranzel's troupe arrives, looking a little bit frazzled and a little confused. He steps forward to the rest of you and goes, “I don't know what you did, but there's a manhunt for two gnomes right now over by the Promenade. But good on you. Might want to lay low for a little bit.”

SAM: Good thinking.

TALIESIN: The troupe may want to get out of town for a bit, as well.

MATT: “I think that's the plan. We were going to stay a few more days– we had a couple of gigs lined up, but I think we've pressed our luck far enough, so all right! Everyone feeling spectacular?” He claps his hands and the rest of the troupe start grabbing their goods and their instruments and what little cases and bags they do. Kaylie runs off real fast and comes back with her one over-the-shoulder satchel that carries all of her worldly belongings. “Then let us be off.” He gives a little tip of the hat to Scanlan with a nod. Looks to the rest of you. “We greatly appreciate your hospitality. We're sorry for any confusion, misunderstandings, and general debauchery. Good night to you all.” He turns around and they all start walking out. Kaylie begins stepping and she stops and looks over her shoulder towards you, Scanlan, and says, “Don't come looking for me. When I'm ready, I'll come find you.” She turns back around and leaves.

SAM: Oh, shit.

MARISHA: I liked them. They were fun.

TRAVIS: Did you tell her you're her dad yet?

SAM: That's not– She figured it out, Grog.

TRAVIS: That's awkward.

SAM: Yes. Yes, it is.

LAURA: They forgot to grab their gold. I like them!

MATT: That they did, actually.

MARISHA: Maybe they thought we were even?

LIAM: Probably should check the silverware, though, in the keep.

LAURA: Oh. I run and check the silverware.

TALIESIN: I check to make sure the skull is still there.

MATT: The kitchen is cleaned out.

LAURA: No!

MATT: All of the silverware.

LAURA: What about Jarett? He was supposed to be keeping an eye on them.

MARISHA: Yeah, what the fuck? What's with Jarett?

MATT: Jarett was one man keeping track of multiple people, with one very small, quick child that you were the only one able to keep an eye on.

LAURA: I hate your friends!

MARISHA: They were good drinking buddies.

SAM: They're all right. They've got their good qualities, too.

TRAVIS: Just the silverware's missing?

LAURA: What about our rooms? Is it just the kitchen that's cleaned out, or did they take everything in the keep?

MATT: Oh, no, no, no. None of the rooms have been touched, except for the guest room where some of them were staying.

LAURA: There was shit in there, anyway.

MATT: Yeah, there wasn't much in there, but a couple of candlesticks, things that were just decor. Anything that could possibly be hocked for a little bit of change from those rooms is gone.

LAURA: They don't know I shopped for everything at Home Goods, so joke's on them.

MATT: You gather probably no more than two to three hundred gold worth of materials were taken in total. That includes fine cookware, that includes decor, that includes a couple of previous art pieces that you had collected–

TALIESIN: Please tell me they stole the giant painting.

SAM: It's not here yet.

TALIESIN: Damn it!

MATT: It hasn't been delivered yet. That's probably in transit.

TALIESIN: No!

LIAM: And where would it have been hidden on their person?

TALIESIN: They could have rolled it up and stuck it where the sun don't shine.

MARISHA: A 20 by six foot canvas?

TALIESIN: Some caverns run deep.

SAM: I'm going to check my bed just to see if there's any shit on it.

MATT: You go and inspect pretty extensively. It does not appear that anyone has left you a Scanlan surprise.

MARISHA: Percy and I go downstairs to make sure the skull is still there.

MATT: Skull is still in the workshop, yes.

MARISHA: Beautiful.

MATT: What do you guys want to do right now?

TALIESIN: I'm going to spend some time working on the special barrel and see if I can get that up and running.

MARISHA: What time is it?

MATT: At this point, it's closing towards dusk.

LAURA: We should heal up and get ready to take this to Whitestone in the morning, yes?

MARISHA: I guess so.

TALIESIN: 18.

MATT: 18? All right. You disassemble elements of the pistol. You get the feeling that the way it's weighted, to attach the hand mortar to the pistol, it's still going to continue to be a very unwieldy thing. You are probably best to design them as separate pieces. Unfortunately, the way the pistol's balanced, for aim and such? The mechanism that's required to lob an object for the mortar to be able to do any help with is going to throw off your ability to aim much with the pistol, going forward. Not to mention increase the misfire score by crazy amounts. But you could create them both separately and swap out as needed.

TALIESIN: All right.

MATT: All right. You guys spend the evening. You rest up, you're back to full health, you're good to go. As the morning comes around–

TRAVIS: I have a question.

MATT: Yes?

TRAVIS: Can I wait until everyone goes to bed and can I make my way into Percy's workshop?

TALIESIN: It's locked.

MATT: As you get to the workshop, you check the door and it is, indeed, locked.

MARISHA: We stashed it.

TRAVIS: What's the door made of?

MATT: It's made of solid metal. It was constructed per specifications to be able to withstand concussive blasts in case of accident from the inside.

TRAVIS: Can I try to pick the lock?

MATT: You have no lockpicks.

TRAVIS: Can I shove an axe in the lock hole?

MATT: You can.

SAM: Clang!

MATT: Make a strength check.

TRAVIS: I have a greatsword that's just a normal greatsword.

LAURA: Are you going to try to shove it in the lock?

TRAVIS: Yeah, like a credit card in the side of the thing. Like a crowbar. That was crap.

MATT: What did you roll?

TRAVIS: Ten.

MATT: Ten. In trying to wedge the sword into the side of the door, you eventually feel a shift as you push. You feel it gives way, and you look and withdraw the greatsword, which is now bent at an angle to the side. Yeah, that sword's not going to be functional in combat any further.

TRAVIS: All right, I go to bed.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Nothing good ever happens to you in my workshop. It's just not a good place for you. Too many things.

MATT: All right, so. Morning comes around. You guys come back rested. As you each individually come to consciousness and finding your way down, the first thing you're met by is a very perturbed Laina, who as soon as you come down, says, “I'm terribly sorry. I went to make breakfast, and there's nothing to make breakfast with! I don't know what happened.”

LAURA: It's okay. Scanlan is going to buy all new stuff for our kitchens.

SAM: I'm supposed to lay low, though.

LAURA: Oh, that's okay. You can give her all the gold that she needs to buy new things for the kitchen.

SAM: I have only–

LAURA: You have about a thousand gold because I gave it to you.

SAM: I gave 50 to Percy, which you didn't use.

MATT: To buy basic cooking supplies, it wouldn't be more than 30 gold to restock the entire kitchen. It was more other elements of the keep.

SAM: Including the silverware?

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: Oh, great.

LAURA: It wasn't fancy silverware. It was utilitarian.

MATT: It was decent. It was functional. It was included with the keep.

SAM: All right, here's 50. Go get us a decent set of silverware.

LAURA: And other things. Or send somebody else, if you'd rather.

MATT: “I'm not much help around here right now, am I? All right.” And she runs off, returning a short time later, with groceries, as well, that she found while she was out. Makes a fresh meal for all of you. Partway through breakfast, there is a knock at the edge of the dining hall, and you see Cordell, your half-orc guardian there. Has his big, heavy crossbow at his side. “Sorry to bother you while you're eating. You have a messenger who wishes to speak to you at the front gate.”

LAURA: I'll go.

MATT: “All right. Follow me.”

SAM: Vax never came home last night?

MATT: Did you come home? No? Vax has not showed up yet.

SAM: Should we be worried?

TALIESIN: We're going to have to collect him before we go.

MATT: As you go to the gate, it's opened up and you can see there, standing by himself, Seeker Asum. Hood back, bald halfling helm with his tattoos greeting you. He goes, “Hello, Vex.”

LAURA: Hi.

MATT: “I've come to request your presence at the Precepts Stage within the Cloudtop District near dusk. All of Vox Machina, this evening, if you don't mind.”

LAURA: Oh. Well, why?

MATT: “Uriel and I have been in extensive discussion these past few days, and the reveal of Riskel's betrayal has had a profound effect on Uriel, and rumors have been spreading amongst the district and the higher order of the city. Uriel is to make a statement regarding it and to prevent any political intrigue will talk to the politically inclined populace first. As members of the council, we would like for you to be there to help us based on the reaction. If you would be so kind?”

LAURA: Yes, of course. I'll tell the rest of the group. We were planning on heading out to Whitestone today, but we can put that off if it's very important?

MATT: “It's rather important.”

LAURA: All right. What were you guys fighting about before? Can you tell me?

MATT: “It's nothing you need to worry about.”

LAURA: Really? It looked kind of serious.

MATT: “I think tonight's discussion will absolve any questions you have.”

LAURA: Is anybody in trouble?

MATT: “No. You're fine. You've done nothing.”

LAURA: Can I insight check him?

SAM: We should torture him to find out.

TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot off a limb.

LAURA: 23?

MATT: 23? He seems fairly forthright and honest. There is a sense of urgency to him. He's really insisting you guys be there.

LAURA: Okay. Well, we will be, then.

MATT: “Wondrous. I will notify the rest of the council. I look forward to seeing you this evening.”

LAURA: Yes, if you see my brother anywhere, can you send him home?

MATT: “Yeah, I'll keep an eye out. I have a network in the city. I can probably locate him within the hour, if need be.”

LAURA: Thank you.

MATT: “No worries.” He walks away. As he steps away, you look for a second. You glance away and look back, and he's gone.

LAURA: He is so sneaky. I need to train with him more.

TALIESIN: Like Batman.

LAURA: I go back and tell everybody what he just told me.

SAM: Oh my god!

LAURA: Right?

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I suppose we'll have to put it off for a day, then.

SAM: Yes. Is the skull going to be safe here while we're gone?

TALIESIN: I think so.

SAM: Can it see inside our keep? Can it channel some beast?

TALIESIN: It's locked very far away right now, in a very secure room.

SAM: But not secure magically.

MARISHA: Yeah. Percy, maybe me and you should make some reinforcements or something?

LIAM: It's just radioactive material in the basement. It's fine.

SAM: What if it's a portal? What if it can send a dragon to us, or a worm or something?

TRAVIS: It did say as long as that house stands, it will be very powerful.

TALIESIN: Well, do you think it would be safer somewhere? Do you think there's something you could conjure, perhaps, around it? Or should we move it to another room?

LAURA: I feel like your room is very secure.

TALIESIN: We could always send it straight away to Whitestone. But…

MARISHA: But we'd have to put it with someone else, right?

TALIESIN: We'd have to let someone take it to Whitestone. It could be there today. Or we could keep it in my room, or we could move it perhaps into the temple of Sarenrae?

LAURA: Maybe… how many times can you use that little tree thing, Keyleth?

MARISHA: Once a day.

LAURA: Fuck.

MARISHA: I know. Or else I would totally run it over and run it back.

TALIESIN: Oh. But you can run it over and run back.

MARISHA: Oh, if I use your thing?

SAM: If you, if you go there, take the stone from his sister and you can come right back.

LAURA: Yeah, take the stone from his sister and come back.

MARISHA: I could.

LAURA: Let her know it's useless after the one use.

SAM: Well, let's not lie to Percy's sister. (laughs)

TRAVIS: Is it safe in Whitestone? I mean, the temple of Sarenrae is at least here.

LAURA: Got a good idea. What if you go, you don't take the skull, you tell Allura what's going on, bring her back with you through the tree!

SAM: We keep summoning Allura to solve our magical problems. We brought her to Whitestone and now we're bringing her back?

LAURA: She's really, really smart!

SAM: All right…

LAURA: She can go right back, you can send her right back.

MARISHA: What if she doesn't come?

LAURA: Well, then you come back–

MARISHA: I'd be using a 6th-level spell as a glorified messenger? 'Hey, we found a scary skull.'

SAM: Hey, you used it yesterday for no reason, too.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Wow! Oh my god.

TRAVIS: (high-pitched) The sickest burn. That's the sickest burn! Oh fuck!

TALIESIN: And somehow the coffee has not been poured on your head. That's the greatest magic trick I've seen all night. How are you still dry? It's witchcraft.

MARISHA: You know what, Scanlan, why don't you figure out how to get the damn skull back to Whitestone by yourself, how's that?

TALIESIN: Why don't we just let it be in the room for now– Let's let it be in the room for now, nothing happened last night.

MARISHA: Nothing happened last night, but it seems like a ticking time bomb.

TALIESIN: I'm going down, I have to go get my things anyway, so I'm going to go down. Everything seems fine, doesn't it?

MATT: Untampered, room seems left as it was.

LAURA: It doesn't seem tampered with at all, the door?

TALIESIN: The door is steel reinforced, lined and bolted to the wall; it's not going anywhere. This room is designed to explode.

MARISHA: I mean, I could– all right.

LAURA: Maybe we should make sure there's, like, fabric over it.

TALIESIN: It's hidden in the room.

TRAVIS: Maybe we should go in and check on it.

MARISHA: I could Wall Of Stone another kind of box around it.

TALIESIN: I go into the room, I shut the door behind me. I check my hiding place.

MATT: Untouched.

TALIESIN: And it's untouched and perfectly reasonable. I return it to my hiding place. Which, if I have to reveal it later, I will happily tell you where it's hidden. Shut and lock the door behind me. Everything's fine.

TRAVIS: That's a relief.

TALIESIN: Let's find your brother.

MARISHA: All right. I guess we're staying in town.

SAM: We're leaving the skull?

MARISHA: Seems okay.

SAM: (laughing) Let's at least post Jarett here.

MARISHA: Yeah, let's post someone here, I guess.

MATT: Jarett's already, by the way, off to the side listening to this whole conversation.

SAM: Do you ever sleep, Jarett?

MATT: “I sleep when I'm not needed. But it seems right now I am needed, and I am more than happy to stand guard. It's what you pay me for.”

SAM: You're so cool.

LAURA: You're seriously the coolest guy.

MARISHA: Yeah, you're great.

MATT: “You're being absolutely ridiculous. Continue.”

(laughter)

TALIESIN: If anything strange happens, make note of it.

MATT: “Of course.”

MARISHA: Don't let anyone in or out.

TALIESIN: Well, he can't, he doesn't have the key anyway.

MATT: “No. This is true.”

MARISHA: I'm just saying.

MATT: “It'll be done.”

MARISHA: All right.

MATT: “All right.”

MARISHA: Okay?

MATT: “Okay.”

LAURA: We need to give him a raise.

MATT: “Yes, you do.”

SAM: Why don't you just take it from my money?

TALIESIN: I throw ten gold at him right now, just in lieu of– I throw ten gold.

MATT: “Very generous of you, Percival.”

TALIESIN: It's the very least.

MATT: And he sets up his chair in the far corner, staring at the door again, and sets his crossbow over his shoulder and just sits waiting.

TALIESIN: Let's go find your brother.

MATT: Now, Vax, what are you up to?

LIAM: I mean, I'm assuming– I didn't go there to find anything, but I went just to think, and I didn't see anything by chance, no?

MATT: Nope. You detect no movement inside whatsoever. Dark windows over the course of the evening, no sign.

LIAM: All right, well, I guess I'll go back to the keep.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: And I will sit up. No one's there? I'll sit up in my sister's room.

MATT: All right. Well, as you guys are walking back–

LIAM: Stealth, please. I'm not walking in the open.

MATT: All right, make a stealth check.

LIAM: 27.

MATT: 27? All right. All of you that are out looking for him, make a perception check.

MARISHA: 29.

TALIESIN: 18.

MATT: As you guys spend a good portion of the morning scouting about the usual paths that you take as a group, knowing the back alleys and the various paths that you walk through Emon to ensure that you avoid the main thoroughfares and the most-used walkways, as you're glancing about you see a quick shadow shift past about the size of the individual you are seeking.

TALIESIN: (puffs air) Sorry.

MATT: You look over and you see Vax dart off around the corner and dodge down an alleyway.

MARISHA: Vax? Vax!

MATT: You faintly hear Keyleth's voice behind you.

LIAM: Not now, Kiki. And I just keep going.

LAURA: Did you find him?

MARISHA: Nope.

LAURA: Vax!

MATT: You guys spend the better part of the day searching for him. Asking questions, nobody has an idea. A few individuals try and squeeze some gold out of you. You eventually manage to gather they have no idea what they're talking about. By about early afternoon, two o'clock in the afternoon, you eventually make your way back to the keep, figuring that he'll find his way back if he doesn't want to be found. Upon arrival, the guards also haven't seen him. But once you go up to your room to get into more comfortable attire, your brother is sitting inside your room, waiting.

LAURA: Well, there you are. What's going on?

LIAM: Look, everything's fine. All right?

LAURA: I believe you. Fully.

LIAM: Everything's fine. I just don't know what we're doing, anymore.

LAURA: What do you mean?

LIAM: I don't know what we're doing, I don't know why we're doing it. I don't know! I've just been thinking about it, I mean, what is the point of our lives?

LAURA: Well, that's a very deep question.

LIAM: Yeah. It's fine, let's go. I don't know what I missed. I can go wherever everybody wants to go.

LAURA: No. (sigh) Sit down! Seems like a problem in your mind. Are you mad because we're stealing gold? Are you mad because everybody's running off in directions and you can't keep up? Are you mad because you almost died?

LIAM: No. When it was just you and me, I knew what we were doing. We were just trying to survive.

LAURA: Right! That's really all we're doing now, just on a grander scale.

LIAM: (sighs) We're running into this shit on purpose now. Which is all right, when there's reason. I don't always know why we're doing the things we do. It was fun, breaking into that house. I'm good at it!

LAURA: Yes, you are.

LIAM: I don't know why we did it! I don't know why I'm working with a large fucking beast of a man who seems to despise me. Day after day.

LAURA: He doesn't despise you.

LIAM: The fuck he doesn't. I don't know why we're doing it. I don't know why we're with most of these people! And I love these people, but I don't know why we're doing it! And I just want you to think about a little bit too. And I walk out the door.

LAURA: I get ready for the evening.

MATT: Okay. As the sun draws across the sky, pushing towards dusk as the light blue begins to turn to a somewhat purplish-orange hue, you all gather your materials, whatever attire you wish to bring, and make your way towards the Cloudtop District. Anyone wish to do anything else?

LIAM: I'm going through my vast array of cloaks.

(laughter)

LIAM: And I'm taking the other one. And putting of all my many two cloaks, I'm going to put the other one on.

MATT: All right.

SAM: Can I swing by Gilmore's and just see if he or– Sherri works there?

MATT: Sherri works there.

SAM: Sherri works there, if they're around?

MATT: Going to ask. Sherri kinda greets you as you enter and goes, “Hello, Scanlan. Gilmore is back in Westruun, weeks away from opening his new establishment, but can I help you?”

SAM: Two things. One, when he returns, he made me a potion, a while back. I'm running a bit low. It was a scrying sort of thing. When he gets back, maybe he can whip me up another batch for next time I come pay a visit, but also– oh, yes?

MATT: She puts up her hand for a second and walks off through the beaded curtains in the back, and comes back with Gilmore.

SAM: Oh!

MATT: Gilmore steps forth. “Terribly sorry, Scanlan, trying to keep business right now kind of on the DL. There's a special event tonight.” And you see how dressed up he is. “I imagine, being part of the council, you're probably invited too.”

SAM: Yes, I was just going there now.

MATT: “Oh, well, I'll accompany you!”

SAM: All right, we'll save business for another day.

MATT: “Well, what business did you have?”

SAM: I just wondered– I may want to try to find someone at some point tonight. I don't know how.

MATT: “Hmm, scrying. We've had this conversation before.”

SAM: Yes, but a different sort, a less fecal sort.

MATT: “Not going to lie, I'm very glad to hear that.”

LIAM: Fecal matters.

SAM: I don't know how to scry, I don't know how to find someone or what I need. I may have a hair strand or two, but I don't have much to go on.

MATT: “That should be plenty. If I can't help you, I know a few that might be able to.”

SAM: All right.

MATT: “But! Nevertheless.” And he adjusts his collar and he's very, very well dressed in his long, deep navy robes, a high collar that nips at the side of his neck. “Shall we?”

SAM: Absolutely. You lead!

MATT: He leads you out towards the Cloudtop.

TRAVIS: Could I have also gone to Gilmore's?

MATT: If you'd like to.

SAM: Oh! Oh, Grog! Oh, Jesus!

TRAVIS: No no no, just, we go in together and when he's talking to Gilmore, I find one of the lesser clerks and I say: Do you sell lockpicks here?

MATT: The other clerk is probably a new hire, you haven't seen him here before. Young, early 20s, very, very thin hair, kind of waify. “Lockpicks? This isn't–”

TRAVIS: Yeah, you know. I keep locking myself in the shitter and I'm really tired of asking people to come let me out. It's really–

MATT: “I wish I could help. Those are outlawed, I'm sorry. That's not really–”

TRAVIS: Look, I've got these huge clumsy-fuck hands. Is there anything you could give me, maybe magical, that would just keep me from being embarrassed in front of my friends? It smells so bad and then they all come and the door opens and it's just awful!

MATT: As you're getting closer and closer to him, this, looming goliath who's feigning fear and worry in his face, the guy just retracts. “I'm sorry! I don't– We're closing shop!”

TRAVIS: No, do you have like a wand or a potion or like, a thing–

MATT: “Good night!” And he runs up the stairs to the second floor.

TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Lovely goods you have here. I'll let myself out.

MATT: “We'll come with you don't worry!” He puts his other arm out.

TRAVIS: All right.

MATT: The three of you arm in arm.

LIAM: He's currently like this.

MATT: Yeah! He's, like, lifted.

SAM: It's the Wizard of Oz!

MATT: Yeah! You skip along, the rest of you make your way to the Cloudtop, and you make your way around the stage and it's against the wall, near one of the entrances to the Cloudtop, but on the interior. And you can see there is a rather large stage up against the wall. There is already a crowd gathered. You see merchants, highborn families, political guests, upper-station military, a number of well-dressed representatives from all over Emon have gathered for this. You guys meet up with the rest of the group and you kind of, you know, gravitate. Gilmore gives everyone a quick wave and gives you a respectful nod. “Aha! Yes!” and he wanders off and starts mingling with some of the other guests. Just as the sun vanishes beneath the distant horizon, a procession of palace guards approach the area, the crowd parting, as Uriel arrives with the escort, flanked by his family, and the current inner council of Tal'Dorei with Arbiter Brom, Seeker Asum, Tofor Brotorus. Allura is absent of course, for being in Whitestone. They all step onto the stage along with the guards as well, as cheers and light applause begins to break out. Not crazy go wild, but just like (muted) “Hooray.”

MARISHA: Rich people clapping, sure.

MATT: Yeah, you know.

MATT: Guards have already set up a few chairs on the stage. Uriel begins to sit on one as his family gathers behind it, and he puts his hand out and motions to everybody to go ahead and hush down. As he does, he stands up from his chair. “Friends and family. Allies of this fair city of Emon. Houses-in-arms to the Tal'Dorei family. Guests, guardians and law-keepers alike. I thank you for coming on such short notice. Now, it has not escaped me that talk spreads quickly within these walls, and rumors only seek to undermine trust. It is true Lord Riskel Daxio, honored member of our council and overseer of development within Emon for many years, has unfortunately passed away. We mourn our friend, and ask you all to respect his legacy enough to not to smear his name. That being said, this was just one of many hardships that has befallen our council and my family this past year. Many that have left me with a terrible burden. We've been faced with deceit, and I failed to see it. We've been beset with allies in need, and I have been noncommittal in aiding them. We've been clouded by demonic powers, and I've failed to protect my family. And my responsibility to all of you. I look back at my bloodline, at my father and his father before him, and I plainly see what I am not. These times are different. This wonderful city has grown these past centuries into something grand: a beacon of civilization, here in these lands that my ancestors gave name to. My family has built us up, and I feel that there is little more my family can accomplish for the greatness of these lands. It has outgrown our meager guidance. I did not choose to be your sovereign; it was by blood that I came into this. And I did my very, very best to live up to your expectations. I can see the future of you all and I wish to safeguard it, by leaving it not in one hand, but the hands of many. As of the end of this week, I will be stepping down as your sovereign. The Tal'Dorei bloodline will no longer hold the fate of this realm. We will instead leave the council to rule.” And he looks about at the other council members, on out to you, out to the rest of the group. “There will be a chosen few, exemplary members of our society, who will step up and aid in this task, and join the council as well. You, the peoples of Emon, will be the ones to guide us to a new age of prosperity.” At this point now the claps come in again and some cheers happen. There's a little bit of confusion in the crowd, but for the most part everyone seems to be into it. At this moment, one of the guards hurries up the side of the stage and, you notice, whispers something into Asum's ear, who leans over and gives a nod and worried expression. Vex.

LAURA: (giggles) Yay!

SAM: (radio DJ voice) Don't forget to subscribe to Geek and Sundry, so you can see archives of the show and many others! I don't even know–

LAURA: Wait.

TRAVIS: It's hard, right? When one ear's in and one ear's out, it's tough. I was trying to plug it.

SAM: Remember, Liam doesn't really hate Travis in real life!

(laughter)

LAURA: Wait, wait. As soon as I notice that, I touch Grog and Vax's shoulders and I point up really fast.

MATT: You look up and– you guys all gather this as well. You can see, piercing out of some of the cloud cover above, what looks to be two fast-moving streaks of color, black and red. They just– (whoosh). And then you can't see them any more.

LAURA: Could I tell from my favored enemy-ness that it was dragons?

MATT: You can make a hefty perception check if you like to see exactly how much detail you can make out.

TRAVIS: Can I look up, too?

MATT: No. I'm giving her this because of her really high perception.

LAURA: No, that was wrong. 23.

MATT: 23. It's hard to make out details from this distance. They're moving quick.

LAURA: One black and one red?

MATT: Uriel now goes, “I am beyond confident that all doubts in the capabilities of those I leave the city to, and more–” And it's at this point you start hearing bells going off around the city. Tops of walls in the distance. You recognize these. These are warning bells. At which point the crowd starts murmuring and getting nervous, and Uriel puts his hand out. “Please, please. I–”

LAURA: Can I use my Primeval Awareness to see if it's actually dragons close by?

MATT: Okay. You begin to concentrate on that for the moment. Asum now steps up and says, “Everyone, if I might ask you to all quickly make your way to your respective homes. There is a small emergency we must attend to.” At this point, you guys hear this (whoosh) sound and you turn around just in time to see what looks to be a large, larger than you've seen before, white dragon just slam into the side of Allura's tower in the distance. Claws clunk into the side, digging into the stonework, wings unfurled, it looks into the upper window of where her actual parlor is and peeks in for a second before just unleashing a blast of icy cold magical breath into the inside of the tower. You can see now, screams start tearing around you as the guards start getting their weapons ready. At which point, the dragon pulls its head back and looks about at everyone screaming, and pushes off the tower. As it does you see the stonework crack, and the top of Allura's tower shatter–

LAURA: Oh, my god!

MATT: – and then begin to collapse, smashing into the city streets around you. At which point, the dragon (wingbeats) and takes off again above you. At this point in time: utter chaos has been unleashed, and you can see now the guards are rushing Uriel off the table. You guys are there caught amongst this chaos. At this very moment, as the white dragon heads deeper into the city, you hear a loud impact that silences the chaotic air around you, as the wall that the stage is buttressed up against now has perched above it an enormous vision of death: a grinning ancient green dragon. Its wings are curled around its form as it looks down at the rest of you in the middle of this open space and goes, “Delicious cattle. Raishan enjoys the taste of fear.”

LAURA AND MARISHA: Raishan?

MATT: At which point it leaps down onto the stage, crushing part of it. I would like you all to roll initiative.

MARISHA: No, what?!

SAM: We can't fight four dragons. Can we?

MARISHA: Wait, did you say four? He didn't say four.

LAURA and SAM: There's a red and a black, a white and a green.

TRAVIS: Are the red and black dragons?

LAURA: They were red and black– of course they were fucking dragons!

TRAVIS: You're sure?

LAURA: Everything else was dragons; why wouldn't it be dragons?

TALIESIN: For the love of God and all that is holy.

MARISHA: Oh Jesus Christ, Taliesin.

LAURA: Are we fighting something now?

MARISHA: Are we just fighting one?

SAM: Oh, hi, dragon!

LAURA: Oh, hi, dragon, you're my favorite customer.

MATT: Grog and Vex were there. Percy was here. Pike was here.

SAM: Don't worry, I'll kill it with music.

MARISHA: Holy balls!

MATT: And this is the chaotic pattern of individuals amongst here.

SAM: My god, look at all those fuckers!

MATT: All right! Now, if I could go ahead and have the initiative scores from you guys. 25 to 20?

TRAVIS: 20 again.

MATT: Anybody else? All right. Okay. 20 to 15?

LIAM: 15 again.

MARISHA: 15 as well.

MATT: All right. Ten to five?

LAURA: 14.

MATT: Oh, 14, sorry. 14.

SAM: 13.

MATT: Scanlan, Pike is after you. Percy, what did you get?

TALIESIN: Nine.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: The castle looks really badass. It's just off of camera.

MATT: Is it? Let me see if I can scoot this forward a little bit for you guys. Now. Top of the round, Grog you're up.

LAURA: Are we really fighting this right now?

MATT: Right there. You're right there, where the red base is.

LAURA: What's happening?

MARISHA: I dunno, what the fuck do we do?

TRAVIS: Well, I only do one thing– (yelling) I go into a rage! And a frenzied rage! And I take out Craven Edge, and I say, how do you feel about dragon?

MATT: “I think it sounds delicious; let's try a taste.”

TRAVIS: (laughs) Great Weapon Master– I run up to the dragon and hack away!

MATT: All right, make your strikes.

TRAVIS: All right, fucking hell, where's that son of a bitch? 19.

MATT: 19 misses.

SAM: 19 misses?

MATT: Yes.

TRAVIS: Everybody hear that?

MARISHA: Dragon.

TRAVIS: 22.

MATT: Just barely hits.

MARISHA: It has an AC of 22. It's some bullshit.

TRAVIS: (mutters) That'll miss.

SAM: Wait, how do I do anything to it?

MATT: Vex, you are familiar with dragons, as one of your enemies. Only the most ancient and powerful of dragons ever reach this size. Chromatic dragons are very selfish entities and do not usually work with individuals of other color patterns. The fact that this is this coordinated between multiple is a very, very bad sign. You're suddenly brought back to a singular moment in your past when you recall seeing four orbs embedded in a wall.

LAURA: Yeah, no, I think we– We brought this on ourselves.

LIAM: Chickens come home to roost.

MATT: So, Grog, damage on the one strike?

TRAVIS: Just on the one. Oh, yeah right, I'm sorry I was so caught up in the fact that I'm just literally going up against death incarnate– hey!

MARISHA: We had no fucking reason to go into that basement.

TRAVIS: 19.

MATT: 19? Okay, 19 damage, good to know. All right, that ends your turn. First, it is Raishan. Raishan– (roars). As you can see now, this burbling cloud of greenish black fume just spills out of its open jaws, outward towards the crowd.

LAURA: Jesus!

MATT: All right.

SAM: Jesus Crit!

MATT: I need Grog, Vex, Pike, and Vax, and Percy to all make a constitution saving throw.

MARISHA: Am I in there as well?

SAM: I was in there as well, I think.

MATT: You were as well, yeah. You guys were as well. So all– Yep. Pretty much everyone but– heh– everyone but Trinket, probably for the best.

TRAVIS: Ten plus eight is 18.

SAM: This is a constitution saving throw?

MATT: Correct.

SAM: Can I use Cutting Words on this? Is this a magical effect? No, wait.

MATT: No this isn't a saving throw thing. It just happens.

SAM: Oof!

LAURA: Bad?

SAM: Oh yeah! (laughs)

SAM: Five.

TALIESIN: 14 with resolve.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: Seven.

LIAM: 14.

LAURA: 20.

TRAVIS: 18.

MATT: Okay. All of you take 66 points of poison damage, as you feel your lungs and your outer flesh begin to burn and curl.

LAURA: 20 didn't save?

MATT: Nope. The rest of the crowd around you screams out in horrible pain as the rest of them gasp and fall to the ground.

MARISHA: Holy fuck, he just took out the entire council.

TRAVIS: If I had resistance to poison damage because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind, is that halved?

MATT: You take that halved, yes. You take only 33.

TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me. I'm like, I can't remember– I can't remember what I'm trying to do. We got to go!

MATT: Actually, before your turn is over, the dragon (whoosh) re-positions itself for the rest of the crowd over there. You get an attack of opportunity against it, if you want.

TRAVIS: Oh hey, awesome. That's a 19.

MATT: 19? That does not hit. You go to strike– it's already out of the way and you find yourself even amongst your rage shaken by this, as you look around for the first time and realize that the crowds of people that were around you are now face down, unmoving on the ground, amongst the open space. As it steps across the wood as it lands, ruining the last bit of stage and landing on the opposite side, Keyleth, it's your turn.

MARISHA: Are there any trees nearby?

TRAVIS: Wouldn't mind turning into that mist right now.

MARISHA: No shit– I didn't learn it! Go ahead.

MATT: There is a tree. There's a tree about 100 feet in that direction.

MARISHA: 100 feet?!

LAURA: Or go inside.

MARISHA: All right, everyone's around me, more or less?

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: I slam my staff on the ground and I cast Anti-Life Shell and I say, (shouts) everyone in the shell– we're running!

MATT: Okay. How big is the radius of the shell?

MARISHA: It's not that big. It's ten feet radius, so you guys are going to have to get close to me.

MARISHA: Ten feet.

LIAM: That's enough for all of us.

MARISHA: That's enough for all of us if we gather.

MATT: That's your radius there.

SAM: I'm right there already!

MATT: All right.

MARISHA: Pike and Scanlan are in it, everyone else needs to get close.

MATT: Yep, all right, and you're going to stay there? Wait for everyone to gather to you, or are you just going to run and everyone else has to catch up? Which, if everyone else makes a dash movement, they could probably get to you next round.

TRAVIS: Yeah, just go.

MARISHA: All right, yeah, I'll do like 20 feet, not my full 30 but enough to where people– no, fuck it, I'll do 30 feet.

MATT: Okay, so you're 30 feet up to the edge there. All right, that ends your turn. Vax.

LIAM: I click my boots, and I– Shit, where is everybody?

LAURA: Running towards Keyleth.

LIAM: I yank Trinket by the fur on his butt and say, come on Trinket! And then start running backwards and grabbing at my sister's cloak as I go towards Keyleth.

MATT: Okay, with the boots of haste you get up within this area pretty easy. Trinket turns and sees you run and looks over towards you, which, it's your next turn.

LAURA: Okay. I don't know why we're not running inside, instead of away. Are we running?

MARISHA: We're running to the tree. So we can Transport Via Plants, was the thought.

LAURA: Got it. Okay, I'm going to shout out in Draconic, and I'm going to say: Raishan! Is that his name?

MATT: Raishan is what it seemed to refer to itself as.

LAURA: Raishan!

MARISHA: You got it, you got it!

LAURA: So sorry for whatever pissed you off so bad–

SAM: All right, you had it.

LAURA: Your fight's with us, not with this city. Leave the townspeople alone. And I take off.

MATT: Okay. I imagine you tell Trinket to do the same?

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, of course.

MATT: So you rush up. Trinket comes and gathers off to the side there–

MARISHA: He's going to kill us, yeah.

LAURA: Oh! Oh! Can I cast something?

MATT: We'll say, you are now there, for those who want to see there, technically, there off to the side.

LAURA: Can I cast something?

MATT: To get over there would take both– it would take a dash action, so, no. Unless it's a bonus action, then you could've, like Hunter's Mark if you want to do something like that.

LAURA: I guess I'll do Hunter's Mark on him. I was going to do Protection From Poison, so I might not full dash.

MATT: Yeah, we'll say– up to you.

MARISHA: Is that a radius thing or just for yourself?

MATT: What do you want to do? Hunter's Mark?

LAURA: I'll Hunter's Mark. I'll just dash. I'm just stupid.

LIAM: Matt, probably too late, but can I retcon– say I'm holding my attack, since I didn't do anything? Fine if not, I just thought–

MATT: With the haste you could've gotten there. I'd say sure. So we'll let you have it. All right, holding your attack for what?

LIAM: If it bears down on us.

MATT: Okay. Scanlan.

SAM: Me? I'm going to–

LAURA: (gasps) What about Gilmore!? Where is he? He was right next to us.

MATT: I know.

TRAVIS: Just keep– it's not about Gilmore right now– it's Scanlan's turn.

SAM: Where is he?

MATT: You can make a perception check.

SAM: 12.

MATT: 12? You don't see Gilmore anywhere. You look about the bodies. You know the color of his robe, but you don't see it anywhere on the ground. In the chaos you really have no idea where he is.

SAM: Okay, I will– (sings) Bigby's Hand! Shamone! I will Bigby's Hand and put it right in front of him and– wow, it's so tiny compared to him!

(laughter)

SAM: I will use it as a Interposing Hand, blocking him from approaching us. And I will use my movement to climb into the circle of good.

MATT: Okay, you can get there. Okay, that ends your turn.

SAM: And I'll– shit.

MATT: Want to inspire somebody?

SAM: I guess, I mean, who's near him? Just Grog right?

MATT: Right now, it's Grog, Percy and Pike are all still out right now.

SAM: They'll get away right, they're going to run? You're going to run, right? They'll be fine. All right. I'll inspire Grog by saying, you're a magnificent, handsome bastard, don't die!

MATT: All right. You take a d10 inspiration die.

TRAVIS: Thank you.

MATT: Pike is going to rush right here and is going to attempt to cast Mass Cure Wounds. Mass Cure Wounds as a 6th-level spell, so that's 4d8 plus five. Six creatures in a 30 foot radius. So that'll be– all of you. She's not going to do it to herself. Or, she can't do it to Grog, so she can get–

SAM: Grog, did you get hit?

MATT: She can get everyone but Trinket, but Trinket seems fine, so– that is seven, eight, 12, 15 plus five– 20 points healed to all of you guys.

SAM: Great, that'll help.

MATT: Except for Grog. That's going to be her turn, and she just moves into the circle there with the rest of her movement. That brings us to Percy.

TALIESIN: I'm going to look for Gilmore.

MATT: Perception check.

TALIESIN: What!

LAURA: What happened to you, Percy?

TALIESIN: I don't know. Nine.

MATT: In this chaos, you have no idea where he is, unfortunately.

TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my attack for if the dragon comes towards us and I'm going to run into the–

MATT: You rush in. all right, at the end of your turn, all the rest of these guys just go running. Running as far away as possible, getting up, going at full sprint all over. The guards are trying to usher people out of the way. You have crying mothers who can't find their kid–

LAURA: Oh god.

MATT: You have absolute chaos, and at this point your hear in the distance a large explosion, as you see a rolling cloud of fire rise up in the distance over the mountain and the rest of regular Emon, surrounding the Cloudtop District. This guy over here's going to run as well. Beginning of that turn, Grog you're up.

TRAVIS: I'm booking ass.

MATT: Okay, with a dash you get over to there.

SAM: Don't worry, my magical hand is there. (laughs)

MATT: Raishan now is going to move over here.

SAM: Hey, but, I try to stop him!

MATT: The hand is going to try to–

SAM: Got a strength of 26.

MARISHA: That's awesome.

MATT: Interposing Hand just gives you cover against the target, and it can't move the hand's space if its strength is four, so it's not going to move through the space, it's going to try and move to the side. So instead of going after you guys, the hand just moves with it and keeps it in between, but it stays approximately here. It then blows towards this crowd here, just catching Grog in the corner. So Grog, I need you to make another constitution save.

SAM: With inspiration.

MATT: With inspiration, if you'd like, if you need it.

TRAVIS: (mutters) I'm okay. 26.

MATT: 26. You succeed, so you take we'll say 33 points of poison damage, halved, to 17. All right. The rest of these guys except for– Oh, no, Grog, no! Grog, no! Those guys all survive, though they're coughing and trying to get away. This brings us to end of his turn. At this point in time you look up and see (whoosh whoosh) another set of wings come slamming down onto this side.

TRAVIS: Holy shit, look at the size of that thing. What the hell?

SAM: (laughing) What is that thing?

MATT: As it lands, it looks down at the group and then runs up the side of a building's rooftop up here.

MARISHA: Oh, Jesus Christ!

LAURA: So we're totally getting in the tree, I know it, we're going to make it.

SAM: (laughs) The tree has been evaporated.

MATT: So, the rest of you guys, are you all moving as a group forward?

SAM: Oh, hells yes!

MATT: Okay, you all go rushing– You all go dashing forward. At full speed, aside from Vax, who can get to the tree this turn, the rest of you are going to get halfway there.

MARISHA: Fuck!

MATT: So we'll say for the purposes of this movement, we'll move it backward.

MARISHA: There's not a closer bush? Nothing closer we can jump in?

MATT: No, not currently. the closest large enough plant to use this ability–

SAM: Me and Pike get there, because I Dimension Door us.

MATT: Okay. Actually, technically Grog can get there too, and Vax and Pike and Scanlan. You guys all get there. The rest of you are all inside the Anti-Life Shell as you're running.

LIAM: I'm not going to leave the group, I'm going to pace with them.

MATT: As you're pushing forward, the large black dragon is just toying with you– it's climbing across the rooftops, and just watching you as you run, and you hear it chuckling under its breath– (menacing chuckle, whoosh, impact).

TALIESIN: Okay, is he taking to the air?

MATT: He takes to the air and jumps to another rooftop.

TALIESIN: I'm going to try as I'm running– do I have enough time to try and take a shot?

MATT: You can, yeah.

TALIESIN: Am I going to be able to keep up with the group?

MATT: Probably not.

TALIESIN: Never mind. Damn it, never mind.

MATT: So you're like, “shit,” and you just keep running. It now jumped over onto this rooftop and Raishan has moved up toward the center and making its way towards you. At this moment, another burst of fire over the wall much closer goes (boom) and swooping out of it, out of the flames, you see the largest red dragon you've ever experienced come swooshing through the flames, rises up past. The two other dragons almost lower their heads as it passes over.

SAM: Maybe they just want their gold back?

MATT: (whoosh) It swoops past without even noticing you all, slams onto the top of the palace, causing part of the entire throne room glass-domed structure to (shattering noise) shatter and break inward before it turns around and plants itself outward. You've seen ancient dragons– this is large for an ancient dragon. In fact, by its sheer size, you feel like you may have encountered this individual before when you were passing through the plane of fire.

LAURA: That fuck that was like the biggest dragon ever ever?

SAM: I don't remember that.

MARISHA: The guy we missed because we laid low from him and he flew over and we were like: 'don't move,' and we missed him?

MATT: As it lands, the two other dragons take a step back and recoil and snarl and you hear this voice come just tearing through the center of the Cloudtop District, saying, “Move on, Umbrasyl. I claim this as my domain now. The rest of you have a task to complete. Go! I shall remain and set a new dominion of the Chroma Conclave.”

SAM: (whispering) Chroma Conclave, that's so cool!

MATT: At which point the two other dragons snap at each other and they both– the black one just takes off in this distance. The green dragon stalks for a second and then (snarls) angrily turns around and climbs back onto the top of the wall and then flies off into the distance as well, both of them heading westward.

LAURA: West.

SAM: Oh, we're okay! Hey guys, it's fine.

MATT: You watch as they curve around and start heading east.

LAURA: East?

MATT: At this point, you guys have now reached the outskirts of the tree and you can see now this large red dragon has planted itself–

LAURA: He died! He died!

MATT: He's fine, he flew off, it's fine. Just begins breathing flames into the center of the Cloudtop. As you can briefly see javelins being thrown, bolts being shot, and you hear a wave of screams in the distance as it rains death through the center of Emon. You're at the tree, Keyleth. Where are you going? Where are you going?

MARISHA: Where are we going, what are we doing? Do we want go back to the keep?

MARISHA: What do we do?

LAURA: To the keep. Get underground.

TRAVIS: We need that skull.

MARISHA: What?!

TRAVIS: The skull grants a wish.

MARISHA: Grog!

SAM: Just get to the keep– we can talk about it there.

MARISHA: I cast Transport Via Plants on the fucking tree!

MATT: The tree– opens up and a small oval, almond-shaped portal and you can see, it's in the intensity, it's partially unstable but it's keeping itself clean. You guys each dive in as the Anti-Life shell vanishes.

LAURA: I shout: Gilmore! Before I go though.

MATT: Okay, and you come leaping through the center of the tree as it closed behind you. And we're going to end tonight's session on that point!

LIAM: Thought we were going to be starting a brand-new Shadowrun campaign next week!

SAM: You know, maybe the warden of that jail was a dragon! And he invited his friends to find us.

LAURA: Did this all happen because we went back to General Krieg's place? Did we kill the entire city because we went back to General Krieg's place?

SAM: But think of the 4,000 gold we got! (laughs)

LAURA: Or maybe this was a long time coming and it just happened to time up.

SAM: We'll find out.

MARISHA: I'm hoping it's the first, I'm hoping it's the first.

MATT: We shall see if all of these interests come to reveal themselves in the future–

LIAM: That was frightening, man.

MATT: – for future episodes of Critical Role.

MARISHA: What did we do?

TRAVIS: You just massacred people. You just committed genocide.

MATT: I just destroyed something that I built. It's a really weird feeling.

LAURA: You destroyed your whole city, Matt.

MARISHA: The whole city, everyone's dead.

TRAVIS: Well done!

SAM: Not everyone, just a couple of dozen people. And Gilmore.

LAURA: This is Act Two of the game, of the video game that you're playing.

MARISHA: Holy fuck.

MATT: So with that, folks, as it closes on 11 o'clock, we have to get ourselves a rest for the evening. We hope you've enjoyed tonight's game. I forgot to announce earlier because I was feeling all tense and– yeah– but we have a winner of our initial drawing.

TALIESIN: It was a thing, wasn't it?

MATT: Earl Grey Austin was the winner tonight of our Critical Role package. So congratulations to you, buddy

TALIESIN: Someone won tonight! That's so nice.

LAURA: Someone won.

MATT: All right, well guys, have a wonderful night, thank you all for watching, we'll see you next Thursday.

MARISHA: I'm going to have an aneurysm. 

Part I

MATT: All right, guys, so welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role. So to get you up to speed real fast: the group Vox Machina, after finishing their foray in Whitestone, finding a member of the council, Riskel Daxio, was a cult member for this entity called Vecna, bringing him to justice and executing him in the throne room of the palace of Emon, they discovered during the search the traveling troupe of Dr. Dranzel's performance troupe, which Scanlan used to be a part of. During this time, they hatched a plan to have Vox Machina seek this house that had fallen into disarray, and the owner disappeared for a while, that may contain some goods. The party went and investigated. They had previously been in the house and were curious as to where it stands at this point in time, especially if more people are disappearing into it. Upon going into what was once General Krieg's house where they once fought a blue dragon, they discovered the corpse of Krieg, long-buried from the collapse of the cavern and picked apart by some other large clawed creature. And immediately got into some sort of a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were essentially battling over whatever it was that was moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and tasty. These adolescent worm creatures, not even fully grown, proved a nice little challenge, but the party managed to succeed in escaping after killing them, before the mother showed up. They returned to Emon, managed to help Scanlan's now-discovered daughter, Kaylie, out of a little pinch in getting imprisoned after she'd gotten into a major bar brawl. And the party returned to their keep, where they were notified that Uriel, the Sovereign of Tal'Dorei and the city state of Emon, had an announcement to make in the Cloudtop District. So gathered Gilmore, gathered the rest of the party, and everyone went to the Cloudtop District around noon at the presentational stage– not at noon, at dusk. Sorry, the other one. So, at which point Uriel announced that he felt he was no longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step down. During this announcement, however, a number of strange entities came through the clouds in the sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons swooped in and began to destroy the city of Emon. Many of the townsfolk gathered at that square were immediately killed. The party as well as a few straggling survivors ran away as both the large, gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase you down. Right before they honed in to pick you off, an even larger ancient red dragon shoved them off to head east to continue their plot after slamming down into the center of Emon and claiming it as his own domain. The party escaped via the druid's Transport Via Plants spell and just stepped through the tree to land in the center of their keep of Greyskull. So now we pick up where that left off. So as you all come rushing through the other side of the transport spell, each one of you comes stumbling out into the center of the temple to Sarenrae that's constructed on the base floor of your keep. The sheer intensity and force that pushes you all through one after another, some of you end up tripping and catching yourself, but nevertheless you all make it through safe and sound before the large tree trunk behind you, the portal, snaps shut, the magic exhausted. The adrenaline still pumping in your head, you're all still thinking over and processing what exactly had just happened and what it means.

TRAVIS: Are we all here?

MARISHA: All those people.

TALIESIN: Yes? Yes?

TRAVIS: Is anyone hurt?

TALIESIN: That's a good question.

MARISHA: Can we see anything from here?

MATT: Looking around right now, you have the stained glass of the complex. The keep seems to be in order. From this perspective, you don't see anything because the city is on the opposite side of the keep. This portion of the temple is actually facing southward.

TALIESIN: I suppose I'd like to get a vantage point, to see what we can see. Is there any way to– I think we all took damage. I think we're all hurt.

TRAVIS: We're all hurt a little bit.

LIAM: Pike, heal?

ASHLEY: Yeah, let me do some healing.

MATT: Pike, be aware, as part–

ASHLEY: I don't know where I'm at.

MATT: Yeah, I'll let you know where you are at. You cast, let's see, you cast Heal once, which I believe was your 6th-level spell, and then you cast Mass Cure Wounds, so a 5th-level spell. So you've cast a 6th and a 5th.

ASHLEY: One 6th and one 5th?

MATT: Correct.

ASHLEY: Okay. All right, and then healthwise, where am I at? Went down 66?

MATT: Healthwise, you were down 66 and then you healed up, I don't remember the exact number. It was like 24. We'll go with 24. It's fine.

ASHLEY: Okay guys, let's do a Mass Cure Wounds then at fourth level.

MATT: Okay. Which one is this? Are you casting Cure Wounds?

ASHLEY: Yeah.

MATT: On who?

ASHLEY: A Mass Cure Wounds, sorry.

MATT: Mass Cure Wounds is a 5th-level spell.

ASHLEY: How low is everybody?

TRAVIS: I'm all right.

LIAM: I'm all right.

LAURA: 43, but if we can take a short rest, we can roll some dice.

MARISHA: I'm at 32, so same thing.

TALIESIN: 57.

TRAVIS: Short rest?

ASHLEY: Short rest.

MARISHA: We should get inside, anyways.

TALIESIN: Let's get inside. I want to see if I can get a vantage from the top.

LIAM: I think in the short term, we need to take care of two things: one, get a vantage point and see how the keep is and what we can see from above. We also need to get the staff out of here, we need to send them away immediately.

TALIESIN: Do we send them away or do we send them down below? Like for shelter?

LAURA: We don't need them running out.

TALIESIN: It's safer than running around outside, that's where I want to end up.

LAURA: Send them below.

LIAM: Out of the city, though, into the wild?

LAURA: If we need to, we can bring them through the portal into Whitestone.

MARISHA: We don't know what all is safe right now.

LIAM: I'm all right, so I'm going to go find the staff and herd them down below and tell them what has happened.

TALIESIN: You can put them in my workshop. Actually–

MARISHA: Why don't we all head down there?

TALIESIN: Yes, let's head down to my workshop because I have to unlock it anyway.

MATT: Pike, are you not casting Cure Mass Wounds? You have one more 5th-level spell, so you could do if you wanted.

ASHLEY: Yeah, let me go ahead and do it.

MATT: Okay. So I believe that's 3d8 plus five, unless I'm mistaken.

LIAM: This one's on everyone?

MATT: This was on, this would be on up to six creatures, so 3d8 plus five. Well, everybody but one.

LAURA: Everybody but Scanlan.

MATT: Sure, everybody but Scanlan, we'll put it there.

ASHLEY: 18.

MATT: Plus five?

ASHLEY: That's plus five.

MATT: Okay, so everyone heals 18 hit points.

ASHLEY: Rolled a little low.

MATT: That's all right. Okay, you're heading off–

LIAM: I'm going to start moving through the entire place, I'm going to start at the front gate and see if anybody's outside.

MATT: As you head into the foyer, the first thing you see is Laina currently panicking about, running around with Erwin falling behind, trying to calm her down and going, “Laina, it's all right “calm down.” And Laina is like, “I don't know what to do, I, I–” She turns around and sees you, “Oh, Master, Master Vax.”

LIAM: It's actually not all right, we need to gather everyone right now, quickly, I'll explain after we've gotten everyone in the keep. We need to go to Percival's workshop, can you help me with that?

MATT: “We can do that, we have a problem–” She points out. The front of the keep is currently opened, the doors and the gate's there and you can hear what sounds like a cluster of very loud voices, shouting and screaming and yelling over each other.

TRAVIS: Outside of the keep?

LIAM: But I'm on my own, right?

MATT: You are, yeah.

MARISHA: What are the voices speaking?

MATT: Are you following him to the foyer? Currently only Vax is.

LIAM: Go to Percival's workshop, go, I will handle it.

MARISHA: I figured we'd all be moving outside, at least.

MATT: All right, as you guys move into the foyer to follow, you see Vax having this conversation with Laina. She and Erwin go head back down, to head down to the workshop. What are you doing?

LIAM: I'm going to go stealth toward the door to see what the hell is going on out there.

MATT: Okay. Roll stealth check.

LIAM: Yeah, it's a 29.

MATT: All right, good to know. All right, so as you go to the door and look out, you can see, along the top wall there are three figures. Takes you a moment to focus, and you realize that it is Kendrick, who's one of your general guards you keep around, as well as Cordell and Shayne. All three of them have crossbows ready, and they're yelling to each other and aiming them over the wall towards the front. However, what you can hear from this point is a chorus of 20, 30 or more voices muffled from the other side of the wall.

LIAM: I'm going to start running up towards them. I'm going to join them on the wall.

MATT: Okay, so there is a ladder at the side, and you climb up the ladder, and as you get closer, you hear people shouting, different voices going, “Let us in, let us in or we'll die!” Voices going, “What are you doing, you going to leave us out here?!” Other people are screaming, you hear crying children, you hear people shrieking.

LIAM: How many people am I seeing down there?

MATT: Well, as you get up to the top and crest over, you can see the three guards are all yelling at each other and yelling over, “We can't, we can't do anything right now, we're waiting for "th–” They look over and see you come over the edge, and you can see there's probably close to 50 or so people that are all pressed up against the gates to the inside of your keep, that are all shouting to be let in.

LIAM: If I look past, do I see anyone else coming towards the keep? Is it just a cluster and that's it, or–

MATT: You can see people that are fleeing from the town in little bits, two or three at a time, trails of individuals that are just now managing to make it outside of the city of Emon itself. Some of them are heading out into the distance, getting far away as possible. A few more are heading towards the keep, and you gather that this crowd has been gathering here for the last few minutes, at the very least.

LIAM: All right, slapping my hand on Kendrick's shoulder. We are going to let these people in. The city has come under attack, everything is fucked beyond belief. There are at least four large, old dragons attacking the city, and these people need to come inside. I don't know what we're going to do with them, but we're going to bring them in now. And you and I are going to wait by the gate for those stragglers to come in. The rest of you, take them inside, join the others.

MATT: They all look at each other. Cordell gives you a nod, “Right, sir, we'll open the gate, hold on.” And you guys all, are you heading out to the courtyard as well? Or are you staying inside the keep?

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we see them.

MATT: So you come out and see this happening and hear them shouting at the top of the wall.

MARISHA: Keyleth stands in the middle of the foyer, unable to move.

TALIESIN: Keep them out of my workshop, but put them into the spare rooms and anywhere we have room.

LAURA: Maybe the cathedral?

TALIESIN: The cathedral is a great idea.

MATT: At this point, you hear this strange high-pitched whine sound. Vax, as you look up, you can see there are these columns of smoke that are billowing out of the city in the distance as mass areas are burning and smoldering. You see coming out of one of the clouds something spinning slowly towards you, and you look up and see it's one of the skyships from the Cloudtop District, one half of it currently in flames.

LAURA: Inside, now!

LIAM: I scream out, get the gates open now!

MATT: At which point, you can see now Shayne and Cordell are pulling on the ratchets, pulling the chains up as fast as they can while putting their eyes up and seeing this as it careens in your direction.

TALIESIN: I'm running up to the tower as quickly as I can.

LIAM: And I'm fireman's pole down the ladder, down one side of the ladder to get to the gate.

MATT: Okay. The gate opens a little bit, enough to get one or two people through, and begins to push through, and you can see now people are yelling in pain as they're being crushed, as the whole mass of them are pushing through the small opening.

LIAM: I scream out: if you rush, you will die!

MATT: It doesn't seem to be affecting anybody, unfortunately. There's this inlaid fear, this animalistic need to survive.

LAURA: I start to grab people arms and pulling them through and helping people get through safely.

MATT: At this point, the skyship has passed overhead, missing the top of the keep and the highest walls by about 40 or so feet. For a few seconds of silence, and you hear impact, shaking the ground for a few seconds. Not far from here, you can see another blast of red fire and a couple of sparks of arcane energy that arc out, as another column of smoke south of you begins to pour up into the sky.

MARISHA: Feeling that, I snap out of it and run to the south exit of the castle to look for the explosion.

MATT: Okay. As you start rushing in that direction, to the south side of the castle, looking back to where the skyship came through, you can see the smoke parts once more, and you see unfurling from within two large white wings bearing down, and you can see as it swoops down, there are groups of people that are rushing 100, 200, 300 feet away, that are pulling themselves out of the ravine that sits between the south walls of Emon and the north walls of your keep. As they're pouring through the mud and the stream there, it's about four or five feet deep, it swoops down and unleashes a blast of freezing cold energy that freezes that whole section of the river solid and every person in that vicinity as well. Locked in place.

MARISHA: Does Keyleth see all of this?

MATT: You don't see this because you're inside the wall. You see it come down and swoop by. You see it circle around. You, however, have a good view of this, right as you're about to go down the wall on the ladder.

TALIESIN: Vex, I need you on the roof.

LAURA: All right. I run up.

MATT: As you go running up, you guys see now it circles back around and its wings tilt to one side as it begins to make its way towards the keep for a second sweep. I would like everyone to roll initiative.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to get down.

MARISHA: Natural 20.

TRAVIS: You want to go first?

MATT: Put you there. Percy and Vex, you guys are up on the wall, technically, right?

TALIESIN: Up here, so we can get down real quick.

MATT: Okay, yeah, so the ladder is there.

TALIESIN: Well, shouldn't there be a door that leads to that anyway?

MATT: The way this is designed is it's a ladder getting up and down.

TALIESIN: Okay. That'll do.

MATT: Did you still go down the ladder, or are you staying up top here?

LIAM: No, I already said I went down.

MATT: Okay, so as soon as you see it swoop overhead, you come back down to the bottom there. Scanlan is currently inside for the sake of this, and may come out here in a moment, he's figuring out what's going on. Grog, where are you?

TRAVIS: I guess I was out in the courtyard, trying to help the cattle come in.

MATT: All right, so let's go ahead and place some cattle.

LAURA: Jesus.

TRAVIS: The door to get back inside is located where?

LAURA: Yeah, where's the cathedral at? Is that what the other entry is?

MATT: This is the entrance to your actual keep, there. Essentially, these two sections here are the doors that lead through to the interior. People are pouring through at this point, trying to get through as fast as possible. Whole cluster of them.

TALIESIN: Got to get that thing finished.

LAURA: There's more on the outside there? Is that what you're putting there?

MATT: Pike, you are where?

ASHLEY: Yeah. Somewhere around there.

MATT: In the center, keeping watch there, all right, and Trinket is with you– or Trinket can't make it up the ladder, so Trinket is staying in the courtyard, probably keeping close to Pike right there. All righty, so. Initiative. 25 to 20.

LIAM: 24.

MARISHA: 22.

TALIESIN: 27. 26, 26.

MATT: What did you get, Keyleth?

MARISHA: 22.

MATT: All right. Who got 20 to 15?

LAURA: 15.

MATT: 15. Pike, what did you get?

ASHLEY: Three!

MATT: Three. Grog?

TRAVIS: Nine.

ASHLEY: I can do some cleanup.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Three!

ASHLEY: Matt, real quick.

TRAVIS: He said 'yeah', you can go ahead.

ASHLEY: Oh, I think I do have a sixth level because I think that sixth level was used for Liam with the worm, and then we came back to the keep to rest.

MATT: That's right, that's correct, you do have a sixth level spell, still. Yes, thank you for the reminder. Good on you. All right, and so here we have Cordell, we have Shayne, and we have Kendrick right there on the top, as well. Top, currently the dragon is about, I'd say, 120 feet off this direction. You're up first, Percy.

TALIESIN: Does it seem like the dragon has noticed us?

MATT: The dragon at the moment is currently seeing the keep. It doesn't notice anyone in particular, it just sees a swarm of people trying to get inside, and it's circling around to try and do another dive attack.

TALIESIN: How dumb am I?

MATT: That's up to you, buddy.

TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

LAURA: Don't be real dumb because I'm standing next to you.

TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to pull out Bad News, and I'm going to make a targeted shot at its wings and try to put a hole into its wings.

MATT: Okay, go for it, go ahead and take the shot.

TRAVIS: What the fuck. Come on, golden snitch.

TALIESIN: Natural 20.

(cheering)

TRAVIS: Get the hell out of here.

TALIESIN: I'm back, baby.

MATT: Go ahead and roll some damage on that.

LIAM: A little, tiny ray of sunshine.

MATT: 4d12 for the hit on that, and then what's the save, to see if it can maintain height?

TALIESIN: It's a constitution saving throw.

MATT: All right– (laughs) It rolled a four.

TALIESIN: Yeah!

MATT: It is plus 14 to its constitution saving throw, so it's 18. What's the DC on that?

TALIESIN: Eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod– So, I don't know– six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 18.

MATT: So it just makes the save.

TALIESIN: Hold on, is that right? It's proficiency bonus.

MATT: Proficiency bonus plus four.

TALIESIN: Plus dexterity, which is six.

MATT: Six, which is 18, and it just makes the save.

TALIESIN: Stupid dragon.

MATT: Just makes its save, but still does damage, go ahead and roll that.

TRAVIS: At least you hit it, you got to bleed it a bit. Longshot.

TALIESIN: 27 points of damage. Let's see, one more, yeah, one more shot at the wings just to see if I can take it down. Make it.

MATT: Okay, the second attack is reload, third attack. Another grit point to try and take it down, go for it. Roll for the attack.

TALIESIN: 25.

MATT: 25 hits. It rolled a three, that is 17.

TALIESIN: (laughs) Drop, fucker!

MATT: Terrible, terrible– All right, so that will effectively reduce its speed, or its height, by what?

TALIESIN: Height by 20 feet? And I imagine that would throw it a bit.

MATT: It might.

LIAM: Now it's angry.

TALIESIN: And let's do some damage. And damage is 20 points of damage.

MATT: 20, nice. All right. 27 points of damage on the round.

TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my movement until it's so close that I want– I'm going to hold my movement until–

MATT: You can hold an action, you can't really hold movement.

TALIESIN: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus action to turn to Vex and: fight or flight? All right, you can answer next turn, yeah.

MATT: However, as the first bullet hits, you see it takes the hit in the wing, but it hits the muscle on the edge. As it goes into its glide to head down, you fire into the other wing, this time blowing a hole through the leather flap, and you can see it lose about 20 feet and is actually now skidding towards the roof of the keep.

LAURA: Oh jeez.

TALIESIN: That was a good plan?

MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: I'm going to dive by that tree.

MATT: Right here?

LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: And I'm going to hold my attack until it is on the ground or low to the ground.

MATT: All right, got it. So you're holding your attack if you can. All right, cool. Keyleth.

MARISHA: Where am I in regards to everyone else?

MATT: You are right here, because you were heading to the south wall when all this went down.

MARISHA: Oh, okay.

MATT: This is the north direction this way. It came this way, swooped past, circled around, and now it's coming back from this direction.

MARISHA: Okay. I want to use my movement to get under that tree.

MATT: Under this tree or that tree?

MARISHA: Yeah, let me– No, towards the entrance– heading for cover.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Here.

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, so you're behind the tree.

MARISHA: And now I'm going to cast Fog Cloud at fourth level, which makes it a radius of 80 feet.

MATT: 80-foot radius?

MARISHA: If you cast it at higher levels, it goes up by 20 feet for each level higher you cast it. So I'm casting it at fourth level. Okay, so I go all Storm for a second, get all misty-eyed, and I want to create a nice low-level fog. Across the whole castle.

MATT: Okay. Okay, so heavily obscured. Heavily obscured will give everyone a ¾ cover bonus– Let me see what heavily obscured would actually do specifically, to be sure real fast, pardon me.

TRAVIS: I don't even know what ¾ cover bonus is.

MATT: It's when you're blocked by something, it gives you a bonus to–

TRAVIS: Never happens to me. I'm usually a ¾ cover bonus.

MATT: All right. It blocks vision entirely, creatures suffer from the blinded condition. So everyone in the entire Keep is now blinded.

MARISHA: Well, I want to make it like a fog cloud over top, so we're blinded by–

MATT: So it's above you guys, is what you're saying?

MARISHA: Yeah, so we're blocked from the dragon as we flee. I hope you guys weren't wanting to shoot at it, by the way.

TALIESIN: Well, we're above it, the cloud would be between–

MATT: The cloud now is– encompasses this whole area here. Which means the only people that are affected by it are the people at the top of this tower right now. Got it. Was that your turn? Your movement?

MARISHA: That's it.

MATT: Cool, stay there?

MARISHA: Well, I moved.

MATT: Right, you moved there. Are you done with your turn? Okay. So now it is the white dragon's turn. The white dragon, as it comes down, you don't see it anymore because the fog cloud obscures it, but you suddenly hear the sound of a heavy object slamming into stone, and the cracking and breaking of stone against the surface, as the dragon has now, due to the fall of height, slammed into the top of the Keep and is tearing its underside against the roof. Who knows the state that the roof of the Keep is going to be in right now, but because of that, I'm going to ahead and–

LAURA: We'll just have Riskel fix it– Oh, wait.

MATT: Well, he was the overseer. He actually had somebody else build the actual thing by hand.

LAURA: Oh, okay. Well, good.

MATT: So it suffers 14 points of damage–

LAURA: That's it?

MATT: Yeah. It's dragonhide, man.

TRAVIS: What about all the spires that are up there, that have anti-dragon poison?

MATT: Yeah. That was a dream, unfortunately. However, it does somewhat emerge– you can see its form somewhat as it comes down in this direction, ending its movement here.

TRAVIS: Oh no.

MARISHA: Wait, it skids to a halt right there?

MATT: It's just the fog cloud. As it slams into the keep and tumbles off the top of it and catches itself in the air (wingbeats).

TRAVIS: How high above us is it?

MATT: It is currently 20 feet above you guys. For its turn, it is going to pick a random direction to try and blast its cold breath at. So let me go ahead and roll the direction on this.

LAURA: Because it's all covered in fog?

MATT: Yeah, it can't see right now. Currently it's obscured. Oh, hold on! But it has blindsight 60 feet, so it has no effect on him, unfortunately. So as it stops in the air, it still manages to use its sense of smell and the general atmospheric ability to sense what's around it. It seem to move its head and search–

LIAM: Can I attack right now? I was holding my attack.

MATT: You can. Now, what's the range on your daggers?

LIAM: 60, because I'm Sharpshooter.

MATT: 30, 40, 50, 60– it's just at the cusp. Like just barely cusp, but yeah, you can get your attack.

LIAM: So I'm going before him, and it's a surprise attack because I'm hidden and I'm going first–

MATT: Yes, you're essentially interrupting his attack because the moment he came into range–

LIAM: So it's an advantage and it is an automatic crit?

MATT: It's not a automatic crit, it's not surprised.

LIAM: It's not surprised?

MATT: No, it know you guys are there.

LIAM: Even hiding behind a tree? All right.

MATT: A surprise generally means that it has absolutely no idea that you are there or there's any sort of threat from you.

LIAM: 24.

MATT: 24 hits.

LIAM: All right. And then the second dagger I throw– I can only throw a second one– is also a 24.

MATT: Both hit.

LIAM: So the first one is double dice, so eight plus– 14, 15, 18, 23, 25. Double dice is 50 plus seven is– Yeah, 57 for the first.

MATT: Ooh, nice.

LIAM: And the second one goes bink. That is a ten.

MATT: Ten, all right. 57 points of damage, that's– Is that straight-up dice rolls? That's crazy.

LIAM: That's Sneak Attack, I've gone up a level to 13–

MATT: Right, so it's a d6 or 7d6.

LIAM: 7d6– Oh, wait.

MATT: It's not doubled, though.

LIAM: Sorry, sorry, sorry. 25 plus seven is 32. Sorry, 32.

MATT: 32, there you go, I was like, that's really high for a non-crit.

LIAM: The second one was ten. 32, ten.

MATT: So 42 points of damage. Still not shabby by any means. Gotcha, as you chuck both daggers in the direction where you can see as it's now at the very bottom of the fog cloud. You have enough visual to strike towards it without missing and both daggers sink into the bottom of the creature. One of them you know was a nice, impactful wounding for any other creature, but it doesn't seem to have taken much issue with the impact of the blade. Appear at your side again. That ends your reaction. Now Vorugal is going to go. Looking at the area of most density–

LIAM: What was his name again?

MATT: Ah, you will know that shortly. The white dragon. The white dragon rears up in the fog cloud and dips down a little bit, (exhales) outside of the fog cloud, hitting everyone in this vicinity here. That's going to be Grog, Trinket, and everyone here over. I would like all of you to make a constitution saving throw. Well, I'm not going to roll that many dice, I'm going to use my dice roller.

ASHLEY: Come on, guys.

MARISHA: “I'm not going to roll that many dice.” Always a good sign.

LIAM: Grog's about to lose ten percent of his hit points.

MATT: I don't have enough d6s, it's 16d6. Or sorry, 16d8, my apologies. All right, so that comes to– Grog, what's your–

TRAVIS: 25.

MATT: 25, that's a success. What's Trinket's?

LAURA: 15.

MATT: 15? All right, that is 63 points of cold damage to Trinket.

LAURA: Trinket is unconscious.

MATT: All right. Trinket actually freezes in place. Now you can see the armor itself has about an inch-thick layer of ice as currently the eyes go dull as unconsciousness takes the bear, but unable to show or reveal that. Grog, you take half that, so you are at– you take 32 points of cold damage. Let me roll some saves here. Average saves– Okay, so these four here survive, the rest of these are all entirely wiped out. And you can see now, the people that were rushing in are now rushing away from the keep. The rest are getting the fuck out of Dodge. So yeah, that's going to be the end of the white dragon's turn. That brings us to Vex. You're up in the fog cloud right now, so you have no visual range on the creature. You hear all these screams and hear the blast.

LAURA: I can't see it?

MATT: No, unfortunately, the fog cloud is just high enough where it covers this area for you guys. However, you could jump off if you wanted to, make an acrobatics roll and then maybe do your attack afterwards. If you wanted to try that, your call.

LAURA: Wouldn't I still be in the fog cloud if I was on the ground?

MATT: No, the fog cloud is elevated up here. It starts here and then goes upward. Keyleth created it in the air. You guys are at the base of it right now.

LAURA: So I can use my movement to jump down?

MATT: Yes, if you want to.

LAURA: All right, I'm going to fucking Hunter's Mark him.

MATT: You can't see him right now, unfortunately.

LAURA: I'm going to jump fucking down on the ground.

MATT: So you jump. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. As you leap off the highest part of the wall of your Keep, all of a sudden the fog dissipates and you see the ground rushing up towards you.

LAURA: 14.

MATT: 14. You manage to catch yourself. You aren't knocked prone, but you do suffer five points of damage from the fall. But you catch yourself (grunts), get up, and now you can see at the very, very base of the fog cloud, the head peeking though and the wings occasionally (wingbeats) from out underneath, and you have visual on the dragon.

LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark him. And I'm going to shoot him through the Sky Sentinel.

MATT: You already used the Sky Sentinel if I recall against the green dragon, didn't you?

LAURA: On the worm.

MATT: Was it the worm? Okay.

LAURA: And I multiclassed today, so I'm a rogue, so I get Sneak Attack on this.

MATT: It currently does not have–

LAURA: Does it know that– does it see me?

MATT: You haven't tried to stealth, so technically yes. As soon as you jumped off and land, and hurt yourself and your ankle, you look up and it sees you.

LAURA: Never fucking mind. Balls, all kind of balls around here right now. The first attack is 25.

MATT: 25 hits.

LAURA: The second attack is 24.

MATT: Both hit.

LAURA: The third attack is 16.

MATT: 16 misses.

LAURA: Okay, so. Let me double-check. An extra d6 for those two. 15 plus seven is what?

LIAM: 15 plus seven is 22.

LAURA: 22 on the first arrow. 15 plus four is 19 on the second arrow. I'm a little upset right now. And then I'm going to shoot the third arrow through the Blazing Bowstring. I mean my second attack.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: And that doesn't hit him, so. Good times.

MATT: So as you land, you get up, pull out your arrow, and as you pull back and release it, you can see it bursts into arcane energy and splits into three different arrows, two slamming into the fog cloud and hitting the sides of the dragon, and it's knocked around for a second. It looks around and its eyes peer at you– You did the additional Hunter's Mark damage on it, right?

LAURA: I did.

MATT: Cool. You see now it's looking around, choosing what its next round is going to be about, and you seem like a tasty morsel, though not entirely drawn to its attention at the moment. You still have a little bit of movement if you wanted to move.

LAURA: Can I– No.

TALIESIN: Just for clarification: which door is back into the keep? That one. Okay.

LAURA: Is it possible to get inside the door?

MATT: Inside of–

LAURA: The door that I'm right there– If I backed up into the door?

MATT: Yeah, I'd say you could. We'll say you're inside right now. You hide inside the best you can to keep out of view.

LAURA: Yeah, I want to be ducked around a wall, if I can, on the inside of the door.

MATT: Okay. That ends your turn?

LAURA: Yes.

MATT: All right, so, at that point now, your guards over here don't have– they can't see at all, but they saw you jump off the side. Kendrick is going to go ahead and take the ladder down, and it's going to be his movement to land there. They're both going to jump and make your– using your example. Cordell, not bad, and Shayne– actually, both rolled pretty well. Both managed to prevent any fall damage, catching themselves on the ground with their heavy crossbows ready. They rush up and fire both at the dragon. Five and a one, god damn– That hits, and a 19. All right, so Cordell and Shayne both manage to get one shot that hits the dragon on both sides. So both bolts hit, so that's seven damage and ten damage, so 17 damage total from them, as they fire the heavy crossbow, try and reload it and get off a second shot. That ends their turn, now. That brings us to Grog's turn.

TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: And run at Trinket.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: He's covered in how much ice?

MATT: About an inch, inch and a half of ice, and the rest of the entities, all the rest of the people that died, they all got frozen in place and some of them shattered in the impact and there's chunks of them frozen on the ground.

LIAM: Is that a medicine check at this point? If Trinket is frozen in ice? You can't say–

MATT: You have no idea.

LIAM: Thanks. Could I pee on him and thaw him out, quickly?

MATT: Over time, yeah. You'll have to drink a lot beforehand and wait a little while, jog in place. What you got, Grog?

TRAVIS: I would like to run to the side that is closest to you, on Trinket. I would like to start pushing him along the lawn, towards the entrance to the Keep, like a giant ice block.

MATT: Okay, so this side there. Go ahead and make a strength check.

TRAVIS: Okay.

MATT: Because you are raging, you have advantage on strength checks.

TRAVIS: Yes, thank god. 18.

MATT: 18, okay. You did suffer damage this turn, but you started raging this turn, so if you don't suffer damage until the beginning of next turn, your rage ends and you'll have to rage again. Just a heads up. But with that roll, though, you managed to push him, we'll say 15 feet that direction. (grunts) Pushing a giant frozen bear and he's sliding against the grass in the front of the courtyard. Sweat's beginning to pop on your brow as your teeth are gritted, and looking over your shoulder, you can still hear the snapping and the– The air itself of the entire courtyard has dropped about 20 degrees, and you can begin to see your breath in the vicinity of this creature. That ends your turn, Grog?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Scanlan now steps out from the inside of the Keep, because Sam is texting me what he wants to do. He rushes out at this point. Seeing all of this from the inside, he whips out his Wand of Fireballs and aims it up at the bottom of the dragon that is now visible underneath. As you see now, the edge of the wand flickers red for a second, before a little bead of light streaks forward and (explosion) detonates beneath it. The dragon would fail its saving throw, but it's going to use its Legendary Resistance once to auto-save, so it takes half damage. He is going to use– What did he tell me, how many slots he wanted to do? Okay, so he's going to use three of its charges to do this one, that will put it at–

LAURA: What is he doing?

LIAM: He's trying to resist. Scanlan sent a Fireball at it and it's fucking with it.

MATT: 36 damage halved from him, so that still puts it at 17 points of fire damage to it, not too shabby. As it blasts out from the opposite side of it through the bottom of the cloud, keeping everyone else outside of the collateral damage radius of the Fireball because of its height, so that's good. Scanlan then, realizing the circumstances, uses the rest of his movement to get back into the very corner of the Keep and defend himself against the wall. That's going to end Scanlan's turn. Pike, you're up.

ASHLEY: All right, I'm– Can I run over to where Trinket is? Okay. I'm going to Cure Wounds on him.

MATT: Okay. So you move over to Trinket. All right, go ahead and cast Cure Wounds.

ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to cast it at 4th-level.

MATT: 4th-level, okay. 4d8 plus five.

TRAVIS: On the floor.

ASHLEY: Dang! 30.

MATT: 30. Trinket heals up– As Pike reaches out, grasping her symbol in one hand, a look of desperation in her face, her hand goes out and touches the ice and as her hand touches, her fingers melt through the ice with divine energy in her fingertips, and manages to touch Trinket's fur beneath. As the divine energy filters through her body, Trinket's form glows from the inside and the ice begins to crack before it all shatters off of Trinket's body and Trinket catches himself (bear grunts) and shakes off what little bit of remaining ice and moisture is on the coat.

LAURA: Thank you guys.

ASHLEY: I want to scratch behind his ears.

MATT: Okay. Trinket goes (bear noises) Trinket nudges you and licks your face before looking up and growling very angrily at the dragon.

LAURA: I don't think Vex even saw any of that, like Vex doesn't even know he was unconscious.

LIAM: Got to go Revenant on that bear!

MATT: That is an angry bear, and those who have seen the movie know how scary an angry bear is. Great. Pike, you still have a little bit of movement, if you want to move. You have like 15 more feet, if you wanted to use that, your call.

ASHLEY: Okay, you guys are my eyes, so I can't really see it from here. But I guess anywhere there's cover. Is that a tree?

MATT: You can start moving towards the tree or the front of the keep, tree is closer but currently has two other people hiding there.

LIAM: Or behind the goliath.

ASHLEY: What was that?

LIAM: Behind the goliath.

ASHLEY: Yeah!

MATT: All right, you move over here and use Grog as cover, we'll say, and leap over there. Classic Pike-Grog technique.

(laughter)

MATT: Cool. Ends your turn. The rest of these survivors on this side of the wall are going to start fleeing in this direction, using their turn to get the hell out. These guys here are going to do a full-round dash to get inside the keep, and they manage to make it inside. These guys here are moving back. Actually, no, these guys now that are inside the keep are going to run, they get almost all the way to the keep. There we go. The dwarf gets about that far, this guy almost makes it in. They're all right at the cusp of getting into the keep, screaming and running past you, moving between the different frozen bodies, not even paying attention to any of you, as the look of sheer terror on their faces has taken over. That brings us to the top of the round. Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to drop down– Like a boss.

MATT: Are you going to leap or climb down?

TALIESIN: I'm going to leap.

MATT: All right, and roll.

TALIESIN: 29.

MATT: 29, success and managed to avoid one of your guards who was right below you. You weren't aware and managed to dodge off to the side this way and use the edge of the wall to kick off to change the trajectory, as you land, carrying Bad News in one hand, three-point landing in the other.

LAURA: Sick, Percy.

LIAM: Hold that gun up from the ground.

MATT: Yep. Just making sure it doesn't damage itself.

TALIESIN: Okay, the next thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to concentrate really hard and I'm going to try and conjure Hex to see if it works.

MATT: Okay. So as you focus and look up, you can see now some of the fog cloud that surrounds it congeals into a darker color and clings to the dragon's form as it is now Hexed by you.

TALIESIN: It still works.

MATT: Is seems that as long as the shadow entity has been within you, though it is no longer bound to your weapon and yourself, it did leave some dark scars on your soul.

LIAM: Left a taint upon you.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: So, just to remind you, that means that he has disadvantage on all agility checks.

MATT: Are you choosing dexterity? Because you choose which one of the–

TALIESIN: Oh, on which checks? Constitution.

MATT: Constitution, all right. So I'll put that down.

LAURA: I like it, I like it.

MATT: I'm not sure that's how it works here. Someone will yell it later.

TALIESIN: Ability check, on any ability checks.

MATT: On ability checks, yes. Good to know.

TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a grit point. I'm going to take another shot to try and drop him.

MATT: Even further?

TALIESIN: Yeah. Just for fun.

MATT: Because saving throws are– I don't–

TALIESIN: Are they not? Because I'll use that Grit point for something else, if–

MATT: I don't believe saves are ability checks, unfortunately, so that wouldn't affect that. Yeah, it is its own circumstance.

TALIESIN: It's its own circumstance? In that case, I'm going to spend my point for Deadeye.

MATT: Okay. Advantage on the shot.

TALIESIN: Advantage on the shot.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: And do I want to go nuts? I'm going to go nuts. I'm going to add Sharpshooter to that, might as well.

MATT: You cannot overlap the shots. No, only one shot effect on an attack at a time, sorry.

TALIESIN: That's fine, here we go.

TRAVIS: Come on, go nuts.

TALIESIN: Both– 25.

MATT: 25 hits.

TALIESIN: 2d12.

MATT: And add your 1d6 damage as well.

TALIESIN: Oh, thank you for reminding me– 17 points of damage plus four points of necrotic damage.

MATT: Nice. 21 damage total.

TALIESIN: I'm going to use the rest of my movement to duck in there. I want to try and spin all the way back so I'm completely out of sight. Is that door open?

MATT: There's a little space there, I mean.

TALIESIN: Open the door.

MARISHA: Does that lead to our keep?

TALIESIN: No, it's the other door that leads to our keep. So we're both going to get in and dual-wall it.

LAURA: Yeah!

TALIESIN: And then I'm going to use my bonus action to take one of my few remaining potions. The medium one.

LAURA: Does the door actually open on it?

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: Heh, that's so cool.

TALIESIN: What does the mid-range potion do? I should really start writing this down. Is it one–

TRAVIS: Mid-range potion?

TALIESIN: The second-level potion.

MATT: Of healing, you mean? That is–

LIAM: 10d10.

MATT: Not so much. Second level, greater healing is 4d4 plus four.

TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four.

MATT: You got it. All right, cool. That ends Percy's turn, Vax, you're up.

LIAM: I want to double check, the boots of speed that I wear, it's ten rounds each day, the haste effect's duration need not be consecutive rounds. So it was one or two back in Emon, and I've had one round here.

MATT: That's the old Pathfinder rules.

LIAM: So what is it, ten minutes now? I think it remember the ten-minute thing–

MATT: No. Haste lasts for a minute, you get to use the spell on you once. Yeah. In this ruleset, it's a little too much.

LIAM: All right, so, I'm going to dash towards the tree in that corner and get away from this clump of my friends.

MATT: Over this way?

LIAM: Towards the wall, yeah. I should be able to get behind that tree, I think, if I dash?

MATT: If you dash, yeah. Yeah, you can get over there, behind that way.

LIAM: So then I'm going to throw a dagger, it's all I can do. Can I use an action to hide? Or it's a bonus action only?

MATT: As you throw it, the arc just misses the bottom, what's the maximum range on the dagger, right?

LIAM: Whoa, I'm asking if instead of throwing a dagger, can I hide instead?

MATT: You could, yeah.

LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.

MATT: Yeah, because right now, it's at 60 feet away, but it's at an upward angle from you, which adds a little more distance, your dagger would miss it at this range, and you would know that.

LIAM: So I'm running balls-out to that tree, and I'm going to go right up against the tree. And fucking wait and that's it.

MATT: Cool. All right, did you roll stealth?

LIAM: Oh, sure. I'm going to use Luck, I still have a little Luck today, good, that's better. 31.

MATT: 31. Good, good, good– Okay, that ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Oh god. Okay, I'm afraid of everything– I'm afraid if I throw up a Wall of Stone or anything like that, he'll be able to be like, oh, I'm a fucking dragon, so I'll go to the other side of the wall. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to start running towards the keep. Start running towards the keep. I'm going to go ahead and cast Conjure Woodland Beings. And I'm going to summon a giant eagle.

TALIESIN: Yeah!

MARISHA: This is dropping my Fog Cloud, since that was real fucking useful.

MATT: So, where are you conjuring it?

MARISHA: I'm gonna conjure it right on the other side of him where it's– I can then have it do an attack, correct? In the same turn?

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: I command it to go for its eyeballs.

LIAM: Eagle to the fucking face.

TALIESIN: Eagle to the eye!

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: Oh, that's inauspicious.

MATT: All right, so as the eagle goes up. Do you have stats for the eagle?

LAURA: That eagle is weally weally close to that dwagon.

MARISHA: Oh right, he's attacking, right, right. He has talons.

MATT: You've got to roll for damage on that.

MARISHA: That was more of a distraction.

MATT: Which spell is this? Conjure–

MARISHA: Conjure Woodland Beings.

MATT: Conjure Woodland Beings.

MARISHA: It's a 4th-level spell.

MATT: 4th-level spell, thank you. All right, great.

MARISHA: It was a 19– Oh wait, plus five is 21.

MATT: I have to roll initiative for it separately as part of the spell. It rolled a 20.

MARISHA: It rolled a 20?

MATT: All right, so I'll say given that case I'll let it go ahead and go immediately, but next turn it starts at 20.

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: That is pretty close to what you got.

MARISHA: It rolled a 21 on its attack.

MATT: 21? Hits! Actually.

(cheering)

MARISHA: Go, eagle, go! Right in the eyes.

TRAVIS: Just barely hits or hits?

MATT: It's close to barely hitting him.

MARISHA: Yeah! 2d– So that's 11 plus three– 14 points of damage.

MATT: 14 points of damage. As the eagle starts clawing at it, you can see the dragon rears back, unexpected to see the sudden giant eagle appear out of the middle of the air and go clawing at its face. You can see it rears back as it does so, moving its head out of the way. Gets a couple of scratches in, but still an ancient dragon. It's more spooked than really hurting from the impact, but it caught it off guard.

MARISHA: It's supposed to be a distraction, all right– And then I use a bonus action to be like: everyone inside!

MATT: All right, that's your turn? Now it is the white dragon's turn. Let's see if its breath weapon returns. Nope, it rolled a one. So instead, it's going to ignore the eagle.

MARISHA: Great.

MATT: As instead it lands right about there.

TRAVIS: It lands?

MATT: It lands (impact). As it impacts, the whole ground shakes around you. As you were pushing Trinket, you look over your shoulders, the shadow encompasses the area, and as you look over, you see it land with a heavy impact. Giant frozen gnashing teeth as mist emanates from the side of its jaws. It's going to use its multiattack, including its Frightful Presence. I need everybody, everybody to roll a wisdom saving throw.

TALIESIN: Including us inside?

MATT: Yep. As it rears back and gives off a horrible roar that shakes the stones of the actual keep.

MARISHA: 23.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: 18.

TRAVIS: 18.

TALIESIN: Seven.

LAURA: Eight for me.

MATT: Oh, Scanlan rolled a 19.

LAURA: And 19 for Trinket.

TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to spend my resolve and reroll that.

MATT: Okay, go for it.

TALIESIN: Ten.

MATT: Okay, everyone who rolled an 18 or lower, it shakes you to your core. You suddenly really realize what you are dealing with here and the fear causes you to fight with the fight or flight impulse in your body. You are considered frightened.

LIAM: Too late for Luck? (laughs) I got one more charge.

TRAVIS: I can't be charmed or frightened.

MATT: Yeah, you're still raging so it doesn't affect you.

LIAM: Nope, nope.

MATT: Nope. Okay. While you are frightened, you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while it's in your line of sight.

LAURA: Man, I wish we would've a Fancy Feast.

MATT: And you cannot move closer to it willingly. You can only move away from it.

LIAM: So attack rolls and what was the other?

MATT: Ability checks. While you can see it. You're so scared of this thing.

LAURA: What is it really called?

MARISHA: Heroes' Feast.

LAURA: Fancy Feast is way better.

MATT: Lower level, but helpful.

LIAM: (singing) I like chicken, I like liver, Meow Mix, Meow Mix, please deliver.

TRAVIS: In the middle of white death.

MATT: It's going to make a bite attack against Pike and two claw attacks against Grog, who are right there. So Pike, you look up as its jaws come down at you from above. That's a natural 20.

TRAVIS: Oh fuck, shit.

MATT: Against you, Grog, two claw attacks, that is 23.

TRAVIS: Come on, taint-smear.

MATT: And 22.

TRAVIS: Tickles, both of them.

MATT: Okay, so against you, Grog, you take–

LAURA: Wait, that was against Grog?

MATT: The bite was against Pike. Two claws against you. So Grog, you take 15 points of slashing damage, reduced to half because you are raging. So, eight. And the other claw, that's a little higher, that is going to be 18 points of slashing damage. So down to nine.

LAURA: So wait, so Pike was the one that took those huge hits?

MATT: The critical bite.

LAURA: (gasps) Are you okay, Pike?

ASHLEY: I don't know. (singing) Critical bite!

LIAM: What's Pike's AC? What's Pike's AC?

MATT: 20, but it rolled a critical hit. So that's–

LIAM: Ooh, what's that face?

TALIESIN: Don't do that!

MATT: So 17 times two. 34 plus eight. 42 points of piercing damage.

ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

MATT: However, you then also suffer, as the freezing jaws clench around you and the cold surrounds you, you suffer an additional, that was 42 right?

LIAM: I think you just said 'two', you just said 'two.'

MATT: Nah. Nine plus– 13 points of cold damage. So 55 points of damage total.

TRAVIS: Where you at, Pike?

LAURA: Are you okay?

ASHLEY: I am at, hold on–

LIAM: Carry the one. Carry the three.

ASHLEY: Hold on, one second.

MATT: Doing math here.

LAURA: “One second, let me check.”

ASHLEY: Okay, I'm at 25. Could be worse, could be worse.

MATT: That ends its turn.

TRAVIS: Are we really fighting this thing or are we running?

MARISHA: That what I was about to ask. Are we fighting or are we running?

TRAVIS: We are getting our fucking asses handed to us.

LAURA: Is it ancient?

TRAVIS: He keeps saying ancient. So it's ancient.

MATT: That brings us to Vex's turn.

LAURA: My turn? I'm feared.

MATT: Yeah, so you can attack it but you can't move closer to it and have disadvantage on all your attacks.

TALIESIN: What can we do to unfear?

MATT: You repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns. Or it lasts for a minute.

LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to use my bonus round to hide. Stealth.

MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll a stealth check.

LAURA: 23. We're stuck where we are because we can't run closer to it.

TRAVIS: You can run away from it.

MATT: You have disadvantage on the stealth check, by the way.

LAURA: I did, and it was 23.

MATT: 23, gotcha.

MARISHA: Who's not feared?

LAURA: Oh! It's disadvantage, but I had advantage.

MATT: So it's just a straight roll.

LAURA: Even. I don't remember what the first–

LIAM: I wasn't paying attention.

LAURA: Should I reroll it?

MATT: We'll take the 23, it's fine. Okay. You're inside and you know it's outside and you heard the roar and shaking and so you can peek around the corner but you cannot move out of the building. You can basically strafe to the side to get a look out as you want to, if you want to fire on it.

LAURA: Okay, I guess I'll try to shoot it, then.

MATT: Okay, go for it. So disadvantage on both your attacks.

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: Trinket shrugged it off, Trinket is like, “Whatever, I got this.”

LAURA: Oh okay so– That was good, that was good, 26. With disadvantage. Okay, so I'll do the first one right now.

MARISHA: If we're running, I don't want to bust out my good shit.

TRAVIS: We've got to run, right? I think it's stupid if we stay.

LIAM: But where do we go? If we're outdoors, we're dead.

MARISHA: We can go down– inside, anyways.

LIAM: And go where?

TRAVIS: I don't know where, can he get inside the keep?

LIAM: Sure, he can dig–

LAURA: 22.

MATT: 22 hits.

LAURA: Because I got Sneak Attack, right, because I'm hiding?

MATT: Yes, because you are technically hiding and it didn't roll high enough perception.

LAURA: Okay, so 23 was the damage on the first arrow.

MATT: All right, was that including the sneak attack d6?

LIAM: I don't know where to go. We can't go above ground because we're dead.

LAURA: Now, the second one I don't think hits, it was like an 18.

MATT: Nope, that misses. So the first one, you fire and it manages to hit the creature because it does not see you. It hits to the side of its neck and looks over. It goes–

LAURA: I duck back behind the wall.

MATT: Okay, behind the wall. You do reveal yourself as part of the strike, and it does see you duck inside and growls.

LAURA: Okay, and I want to send Trinket into the keep, if he can make it.

MATT: Trinket is going to rush this way.

LAURA: Is that, should I send Trinket into the keep?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: It gets an attack of opportunity against Trinket.

LAURA: Balls, what? Really?

TALIESIN: But it's holding Pike, so it has no bite.

MATT: Well, no, it didn't grapple her, it just bit her and released. She managed to get her way out of its mouth. That's going to be a 26 to hit.

LAURA: Ah Jesus, it hits, come on.

MATT: All right, so Trinket takes 14 points of slashing damage.

LAURA: All right.

TRAVIS: Is he good?

LAURA: He's fine. Bear-ly.

MATT: Oh, what! I see what you did. Does that end your turn?

LAURA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Did you do a saving throw?

MATT: Do your saving throw, to see if you shrug off the frightened ability.

LAURA: Okay, so is it wisdom?

MATT: It's wisdom-based, yeah.

LAURA: Ooh, 17, 18, 19!

MATT: 19 is just what you need, you managed to shake off the fright from this. Seeing Trinket rush off, you're like, “Okay, I can do this.” At the end of your turn, the white dragon is going to use–

LAURA: I'm not afraid anymore, you hear that?

MATT: It's going to go ahead and use two of its actions to do a wing attack.

LIAM: Shit.

MATT: So every creature within 15 feet of it, as it's sitting there, beats its wings around it and kicks up all this cold wind and air that blasts out, threatening to knock you off your feet. This is going to affect Grog, Pike, and Shayne. So I need you guys to make a dexterity saving throw.

LAURA: Pike, get out of there!

MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

ASHLEY: I'm trying, I'm trying.

TRAVIS: I have advantage on those. Because of Danger Sense.

ASHLEY: Ah! Natural 20.

TRAVIS: Natural 20!

(cheering)

ASHLEY: I don't have any dexterity modifier.

MATT: Cool. So– All right, so yeah. I'll see if Shayne– Shayne does not make it with a two, so Shayne takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. As she is rushing up, she's dropped her heavy crossbow and she's pulling a weapon out, and she rushes up, yelling, her red hair blown back from the wind as it's beating towards her. She gets bludgeoned with the sheer force of the wind from under the wings and knocked flat on her back. At the end of that attack, it now gets to move half its movement and so it– There we go, a fly speed of 80, it's going to move 40 feet. So that will put it at 20 up this way as it starts backing away. And it's going to move 20 feet in this direction.

TRAVIS: I get an attack of opportunity on it, right?

MATT: As it pulls away from you, yes you do.

LAURA: Pike gets one, too.

MATT: No, actually, neither of you– no, Grog is the only that does, because Pike, you're too far away, and it has reach on its attacks, so it doesn't have to be right up against you to hit you. But you still have to be up against it to get an attack.

TRAVIS: 22. Does that hit?

MATT: That hits, yeah.

TRAVIS: Okay. This is with Craven Edge, five, six.

LAURA: Kill him. Kill him with Craven Edge!

TRAVIS: 19 points of damage.

MATT: 19 points of damage, got it. All right, and has to make its constitution save

LAURA: Disadvantage.

MATT: Not on saving throws. 24. Resist it? All right, cool.

TRAVIS: You fucking piece of shit.

MATT: (laughs) So that ends Vex's turn, the guards now. Shayne will get up and she's now going to regret dropping her crossbow and go over and pick it up again; she's not going to have time to fire it. The other two, down here, are going to be– Cordell is going to turn around and fire off a shot, as well as Kendrick. That's a natural one. That does hit, that does not, and that does not. One hit gets through, rolling ones like crap. That's five points of piercing damage, not great on that round, guards. Then they're going to start rushing towards the keep here, using the rest of their movement. Cordell is going to start moving to the side and start ushering everybody inside. “Go in, go in, go in.” Shayne is going to move up next to you, Grog, and essentially begin to hold the flank with you. Shoulder to shoulder, she, as opposed to the crossbow at this point, and seeing the two of you can work together in this regard, she pulls out a broadsword. That's going to end the guards' turn, Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: Fuck this dragon. As much as I would love to protect this house, we've got to get the fuck out of here. Is Pike right behind me?

MATT: Pike is, yes.

TRAVIS: Can I grab her and run inside the keep?

MATT: If Pike will allow it. Are you going to let Grog do that or are you going to fight him on it?

ASHLEY: No, no, no.

TRAVIS: No, no, no, I can't do it?

ASHLEY: No, no, no, grab me and let's go.

MATT: You reach over and grab Pike, lift her up, and the two of you go bolting towards the keep.

ASHLEY: Grog!

MATT: That'll get you right here in the crowd.

LAURA: Oh jeez, don't attack the crowd.

TRAVIS: 50 feet?

MATT: 50 feet, but you're also having to push through people, so you're getting up, we'll say–

TRAVIS: Little meat sticks, it's not a problem.

MATT: We'll say as you're pushing through here, you get up to the door. You guys are right up there with the full movement.

TRAVIS: I'll even damage them, I don't give a shit.

MATT: There you go, that's your turn. The action was to pick her up. Okay.

TRAVIS: Get out of the way, giant beast coming through.

MATT: Scanlan, at the back, seeing you guys rushing in, and he's happy to see Pike coming into safety at this point. He pulls out his wand again and aims once more with the Fireball.

TRAVIS: The dragon giggles.

MARISHA: Tickles.

TALIESIN: Technically, fire damage should be good.

MATT: Fire damage doesn't do anything additional to it.

TRAVIS: Don't say it smug like that. Jeez. It's our lives!

MATT: 29 damage, makes the save, so 15 points of fire damage to it as it blasts from underneath, singes the edge of one of the trees, but the white dragon appears to still be not really visibly hurting yet.

TRAVIS: Yep, got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

MATT: Scanlan backs up into the keep, at this realization. At that point, nothing is right in range. So yeah, so the white dragon is not going to do anything. At this point in time–

TRAVIS: Nope.

MATT: You guys hear a voice come ringing out from the north side, towards where Emon is. A familiar voice that you've heard before that shouts out, “Enough! You are not to linger, follow the others.” At which point, you see the white dragon glances over the shoulder, and you hear the voice again say, “Vorugal!” And a streak of smoke and red. The red dragon you saw that had perched itself in the center of the city grapples onto the back of Vorugal and throws the dragon off the edge of the wall. And goes tumbling to the south of the keep. Out from the perspective.

LAURA: So how much bigger is Vorugal, like is he–?

MATT: Yeah, he's roughly double the size of the white dragon.

LAURA: Holy crap!

MARISHA: Is this Umbrasyl? Does he refer himself as Umbrasyl?

MATT: No, you haven't heard the name of this one, until that point. Well, I mentioned it earlier.

MARISHA: No, the red dragon.

MATT: The red dragon you haven't heard the name of yet. Umbrasyl is the black dragon. Raishan was the green dragon. So as you hear the impact, you hear the dragon screeching out in anger and no one has any visual at this point, you just hear the sounds over the side. You hear it skid to a halt, but the red dragon is still flying and grabs it, throws it, makes it hit the ground, almost like a show of dominance. And as it arcs back around, it ignores the keep and heads back towards Emon. You see Vorugal now lifting back up into the sky, staring back at the red dragon as it heads back, and you can see in its general demeanor, it's frustrated and angry and it begrudgingly begins to fly towards the east, where you saw the other two dragons continue. As the red dragon returns towards the city, its voice is ringing out at a volume that, even at this distance, is being enhanced by some sort of arcane means, whether it means– it wants to be heard. And as you can see now, as it hits over the far south walls of Emon, it shouts out once more, “Hear me, insects! You that live do so out of mercy. Fight or flee and you forfeit that mercy. Know that your pitiful guardians brought this upon you. That blood is on their hands! Vengeance has been swift, and in its wake, a new age is upon you.” Making its way towards the center of the city. “Be thankful, for until now your lives had no purpose. No meaning. Abandon your gods, your paltry convictions, for now you have a new purpose: to serve me!” And with that, you hear the clattering impact once more of the Cloudtop District, as a half-dozen buildings collapse under its weight as it slams into the center of what probably still stood tall in the middle of the city of Emon. You hear the crumbling wreckage echoing in the distance as it slides to a halt. And a couple of distant slamming sounds as it makes its way into the central borough where the palace once was. Quiet now takes the air, as all the people are still standing frozen in fright of what they just saw, and slowly begin making their way into the keep, whispering, shaking, crying under their breaths, the survivors that are not frozen in the center of Greyskull Keep's courtyard. What do you want to do?

TRAVIS: Pee.

(laughter)

MATT: That is entirely viable.

LIAM: Everyone, we need to go inside.

TALIESIN: Yes.

MARISHA: Is this because of us?

LAURA: Can we heal the frozen people? Is it possible?

MATT: You guys make you way out towards the people currently frozen in the courtyard– What? Did you want to use Cure Wounds?

LAURA: Yeah, sure.

MATT: Okay. You use what level?

LAURA: Two.

MATT: Two, all right.

LIAM: How many people are frozen?

MATT: Currently, I'd say about 14 people are frozen in the courtyard.

LIAM: Can we all do medicine checks on them?

MATT: Six of them are partially shattered, like as part of the impact their bodies (shattering ice) and part of the torso busted, arms missing, upper body's missing. As you cast your 2nd-level Cure Wounds spell and reach out and touch the person to heal them, a crack forms where your hand touched the body and (shattering ice) before the upper part of their torso, head, and leg breaks into ice, and you get the feeling looking around that these individuals are beyond saving at this point.

MARISHA: It's too long, it's too late.

LIAM: Inside, everyone inside now.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we all go inside.

LIAM: Come along.

MATT: All right, so. You guys make your way inside the keep. People are looking about, some people are running through rooms trying to find a place to keep safe. You can see already in the armory there's like a family in there that are huddling, crouched in the corner. Some people have moved on towards the kitchen, people are shouting trying to see if anybody they lost eye contact with is inside, you hear a couple of people shouting names. “Shawn! Shawn!” “Kayla!” Different names being shouted as if they're hoping that someone they got separated from may have made it in. Couple do, a few seem to continue to shout fruitlessly. But the inside energy of the keep is one of tension, fear, and mounting sadness.

LAURA: Can I find Erwen?

MATT: You can, you told the people within the keep to go downstairs

LAURA: Yeah, I go and find him and tell him to start setting up as many beds as he can, as many in the cathedral that we have to– In the chapel. To maybe give some of these people places to stay for the time being.

MATT: All right, so.

ASHLEY: Can I go into the temple?

MATT: You can. As you head downstairs too, you can see Jarett is still there, sitting with his crossbow on his lap, and he's been doing his last duty, which was to watch over your workshop. And as you come down the stairs, he goes, “What's going on, I heard noises upstairs, is everyone all right?”

TALIESIN: No.

LAURA: Everything's gone.

MATT: “May I be excused to aid Erwen in his duty?”

LAURA: Please do.

MATT: “All right.” He gets up and puts his crossbow away, heads upstairs, finds Erwen and Laina's still shaking, she goes, “If we're having guests, should I make food? I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.”

LAURA: Simple food. Fruit, anything.

MATT: “Okay, I'll go ahead and start preparing it.”

TRAVIS: Percy. Can I have a word with you, please?

TALIESIN: I step inside my workshop.

TRAVIS: May I come in?

TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

TRAVIS: Can you shut the door?

TALIESIN: Is there anywhere private in this place at this point?

LAURA: Nobody is in the workshop yet.

MATT: Nobody is in the basement or workshop area. Everyone is seemingly scattered on the base floor of the keep.

TALIESIN: All right.

TRAVIS: Can you lock it?

TALIESIN: All right?

TRAVIS: Listen, the skull we took out of the house. I haven't told you, but it grants a wish and only those that dark things have touched can use it. That's you and that's me, as far as I know. It said it wanted you, but I wasn't going to let him have you. It grants a wish. We can change all of this. I feel like it was there in case the dragons came out of that portal. It was facing the inside of the room, it moves, and there's something in there. I feel like it's a weapon. What the fuck else are we going to do? We go for more help, it'll get killed coming into this city. We're not strong enough to take four of these fucks.

TALIESIN: We have an opportunity here, but we're going to have to be careful.

TRAVIS: I'm listening.

TALIESIN: All right. We're going to need more than just you, we are going to need a few of the others, just in case.

TRAVIS: They have to be touched.

TALIESIN: This is how it's going to work. I'm going to take it out, I'm going to have you go, I'm going to remove it from its hiding place while you go get the rest of them from upstairs.

TRAVIS: But who?

TALIESIN: At the very least, Vax, Keyleth at the very least.

TRAVIS: Keyleth, she's bleached whiter than Whitestone.

TALIESIN: Exactly, we need good people and I'm going to try and talk to it. To try and discern what it is and how it works and what it wants, and if for some strange reason things go wrong, I need people who would be more than willing to at the very least knock me out. So I'm going to be needing you and at least one other, preferably a magic user ready to deal with me if something goes weird.

TRAVIS: I step closer to Percy. I think you only need me.

TALIESIN: I need one other, just in case.

TRAVIS: Name one other.

TALIESIN: Keyleth– Or Vax, pick– Your choice, honestly. Whoever is less busy upstairs.

TRAVIS: All right. I leave.

TALIESIN: I'm going to take the skull out of the hiding place so he doesn't see where I'm removing it from.

MATT: Okay. While this is happening, Pike, Keyleth, Vax, Vex, Scanlan, all of you guys begin helping the guards take beds out of your rooms and bring them downstairs into the main foyer area, basically turning this into a makeshift living space for refugees. Heading towards and moving them into the temple of Sarenrae, as you go into the temple of Sarenrae, you get a bit of a feel of the damage that was sustained from the impact of the dragon upon the top of the keep.

MARISHA: I follow Pike into the temple.

MATT: A large portion of the stained glass on the roof and on the outside has been shattered from rocks and boulders that were– chunks of the top of the keep that were knocked off, and looking up you can see the roof of the keep itself sustained a fair amount of damage. Not enough to really be a serious issue, but it is in a bit of disrepair visually. As you guys are taking the beds from the upstairs to the downstairs, you do notice that a portion of the roof has caved in on the second floor. The guest room has been ruined and the southmost room, which I'll have to check to see who's supposed to be living there, is partially collapsed inwards and you can see the ceiling– the sky from underneath. There is a fair amount of damage to the top of the keep from the impact.

MARISHA: I back into a corner in the temple and collapse into a corner.

MATT: Okay.

ASHLEY: I would like to go over to a quiet spot in the temple and start saying a prayer. And I'd like to cast Planar Ally. You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. So I would like to call on Sarenrae.

MATT: All right, let me pull this up. What level is this?

ASHLEY: It's a 6th-level.

MATT: All right. Let's see here–

ASHLEY: You have to ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment.

MATT: Mm-hm. Yeah, what would you like to do?

ASHLEY: Well I think if I say– Sarenrae, I've been rebuilding your temple for months, so please help us in battle and help rebuild our city, if that's service enough.

MATT: Okay. So as you reach out, you feel Sarenrae's warmth come to you, wordless. Attempting to comfort, but even then there is a trepidation in Sarenrae who is, you gather yourself, still taking in the circumstances that have happened. You feel that warmth begin to coalesce into a specific form, and everyone who has come into the temple with you gasps aloud as over these central worship platforms in the center of the temple, a glowing orb begin to form that then slowly takes the form of a humanoid with wings, similar to the ones you've worn in your celestial form. As the light fades, you can see, levitating roughly a foot off the ground, a human. White eyes and pale blue skin, hairless with a simple breastplate that's silver with gold lining on it, a single sword sheathed on the side, and beautiful white angel wings sprouting from its back. The entity stands there and looks down towards you. “I have been sent to your aid. Are you, Pike Trickfoot, to give me a task?” The voice itself seems otherworldly, and understanding the basis of the spell, you need a specific task in mind for it, and it is expensive to maintain in materials, the longer the task requires.

ASHLEY: Okay. We need your help. As you can see, our city has fallen to pieces by these dragons that are attacking us. And we ask that you aid us in battle somehow.

MATT: “Lead me to a battle if you wish. I haven't much time on your plane. If you have a task that I can complete at this moment.” And you know that to maintain this spell cost about 100 gold per minute.

ASHLEY: Okay. Ah, shit. Okay.

MATT: Or 1,000 gold per hour depending on the– Or 10,000 gold per day. Yeah, it depends on the task it required. It needs to be a little more specific than just aid us in battle,” because if there isn't a immediate battle happening, because the longer it's out, the more expensive it will be. You asked it to rebuild and it looks to you and says, “If you require my aid in rebuilding…” She looks with her head around the temple. “This I can help with quite a bit of haste, as it is within the realm of our patron lady.”

ASHLEY: Okay, well, yes. Rebuild our keep.

MATT: “It will be done, within the hour.” So you can mark off 1,000 gold worth of materials, and at this point, the Planar Ally's wings unfurl and begin to float up, and as it does it lift its hands and all the shattered stained glass begins to lift off the ground with it. And you watch as they all begin to reform.

LAURA: That's pretty sick.

MATT: And begin to, through pure divine energy, rebuild the entirely of the temple around within a matter of minutes. While everyone else is looking in awe, you can begin to see around you, many people who had been shaken to the core of their being, who had lost all hope, even this visual representation of the power of Sarenrae and the faith you put into her, you can see people are now bowing in deep prayer at the center of the temple as it's being rebuilt. This has been a very impactful moment for the survivors you've taken under your wing.

MARISHA: I wander over to Pike and just I grab her hand as I watch.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: I'm busying myself trying to bandage any of the survivors that seem injured.

MATT: Okay. There are injuries, many sustained from rubble falling or trying to get out as fast as possible, slamming themselves into ruins or fallen rock and flaming or whatever else happened. So you tend to the wounds, so you guys are helping out with those who are hurt.

LIAM: I'm helping and as we do so I say: I don't know what's going to happen in the following hours. Do not go far from me. If we are out of earshot, you are too far from me. Do not go far from me.

LAURA: Do you think this is what– Do you think this is what Mother saw before she died?

LIAM: Do not go far from me.

LAURA: I won't, I swear.

MATT: Percy and Grog, you find your way back up to the foyer.

TALIESIN: The second he leaves the keep, I rush to pull the skull out, shut the door, put it on the table, sit down in front of it, and say, okay, talk. You have my attention.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Okay, I got a minute before he comes back.

MATT: You do, you do.

LAURA: He's a dick.

LIAM: He's just a sociopath, that's all.

[no audio]

TRAVIS: Fire and ice sale.

LAURA: Hey, check out those Critical Role shirts on Geekandsundry.com. They sure are lovely.

MARISHA: Donate to 826LA.

MARISHA: Oh god, I feel like I should scootch over.

LAURA: I know, can't hear it?

LIAM: That is a long talk.

TALIESIN: (softly) At what price?

LAURA: Ugh, what is he saying? Oh my god.

MATT: All right, sorry.

TALIESIN: I then take the velvet cloth and put it back over it and put it over and set it up as if I haven't talked to it.

MATT: Okay, all right, so. And once again reminding you, the skull itself, it's humanoid but it's elongated, it's not a human skull. Its jaw itself is– you would say almost elvish, but the features are too sunken, the teeth are too long, and the skull itself is a little more oblong to the back. Yeah, you're unfamiliar what species or race this may have been when it was alive.

TRAVIS: As I was leaving, can I notice anything about the back of his door? Like is– a lock or is it flat, plain?

MATT: I'm gonna go ahead and have you make an investigation check.

TRAVIS: 13. Minus two, you asshole.

(laughter)

MATT: As you start walking out, you turn and look at the door and take a moment to inspect it. I mean, Grog, doors are doors, you know how to deal with doors. This is a weird door. You don't know how this door works.

TALIESIN: My door is unlocked.

MATT: Right, but he doesn't understand the mechanism of what–

TALIESIN: Oh, no. I built with you in mind.

TRAVIS: I bet I can figure the lock from the inside. And I open the door and it opens because it's unlocked.

MATT: Okay, right, as soon as you throw the velvet over, the door opens up.

TRAVIS: I go up and I try and find Vax.

MATT: Okay, you go up and you see the two of them helping people along, making eye contact. You can see the drying tears across their faces as they are trying to stay strong for those that are currently in a less emotionally stable position right now.

TRAVIS: Sorry to break up an awkward moment, Vax, do you have a moment?

LIAM: What do you need?

TRAVIS: May I speak to you alone? No offense, Vex.

LAURA: None taken. I go and help other people and call to Trinket to carry over some bandages for me.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: You and I may have had some friction recently, and we have our differences, but we're on the same side. Percy needs you downstairs. Will you come with me?

LIAM: I look at my sister. What is it? What does he need?

TRAVIS: I would tell you, but I don't want to frighten anyone in this room. It's about the– (quieter) It's about the skull and I can only bring one. Percy's request.

LIAM: Wait here.

TRAVIS: I have to come with you.

LIAM: Just wait a second. I walk over to my sister. I'm going downstairs. If I'm not back here in five minutes, I want you to come down, do you understand? And I say that because I need you, you are stronger than me and I will need you. Tend to the wounded, five minutes. I follow Grog.

MATT: All right.

TRAVIS: I go back downstairs.

LAURA: I Hunter's Mark Grog as he walks away.

TRAVIS: What? Why?

LAURA: I don't know. I just do.

MATT: Okay. I'm going ahead and say make a sleight of hand check and make a perception check.

TRAVIS: I'm sure this is going to go dandy.

19! (laughs)

LAURA: Fucking A!

TRAVIS: I don't know why I'm so excited right now. Everything's dead.

LAURA: 15.

MATT: As you're walking away, you feel this strange pulse of tingling energy. Almost like a soft–

LAURA: Aw, you know what?

MATT: What?

LAURA: I haven't chosen my fucking rogue ability yet, my rogue proficiency.

LIAM: Rogue proficiency bump.

LAURA: Too late now.

MATT: You feel this magical essence creep up on you. You are not familiar with it, but you feel like something just attached to you.

TRAVIS: From any direction? Or just attached?

MATT: You aren't entirely sure.

TRAVIS: I look about. Is there anything looking at me? Anybody throw anything at me? Pour anything on me?

MATT: Make a stealth check, Vex.

LAURA: I'm choosing my dice. Okay, okay, okay. I get advantage on all stealth checks?

LIAM: Yes. Because the cloak, yes

LAURA: 24.

MATT: You look about, and in the chaos of the people, you have no idea what the source of this weird tingling was.

TRAVIS: This keep is fucking drafty. I go downstairs.

MATT: Okay. As you walk downstairs, you find your way to Percy's workshop, we're going to take a break.

(cheering)

LAURA: Jeez Louise.

LIAM: Thank goodness.

MATT: All right, make this one quick guys, get back into it while we still have the tension in the story going. So we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.

TRAVIS: Five minutes, five minutes.

LIAM: Five minutes. Pizza and five minutes.

MATT: You good?

LAURA: Is the food here?

MATT: It should be, I hope so.
Break

[break]

MATT: Hi, my name is Matthew Mercer, I'm a voice actor and the dungeon master for Geek and Sundry's Critical Role, and welcome to my short video series for my tips on how to dungeon master or game master your own roleplaying games.

So today, our first topic is going to be Encounter Building. So when you are creating an encounter, a combat encounter specifically for your party of adventurers or space marines or whatever else you are running, you want to consider what kind of terrain or region is this going to have. That's going to go ahead and help you guide what creatures are going to be there, what type of challenges might be in that way. So consider, is it a icy tundra, is it a frozen mountaintop or is it like a hot, muggy swampland, is it a underground cave network? There are actually a lot of these resource books that you can find for these RPGs that will have listings of creatures and monsters and dangers by topography, and by weather, and that's a really cool way to see what indigenous creatures might live there, and that's a good resource to pull from if you're not having any creative juices helping you decide what to put in front of them.

Secondly, you want to consider how challenging you want the encounter or encounters to be. Do you want it to be a really quick scuffle, do you want it to be a series of small battles, as to opposed to fighting in a long hallway, in a spaceship? Do you want it to be one giant climatic multi-leveled boss confrontation? Once you've made that decision, that'll help you figure out how dangerous, how extensive, and how powerful the villains may be for this encounter. There's a lot of great resource manuals for every RPG system out there that have breakdowns about what creatures are good for which player levels as far as power or challenge and danger is concerned. Like, for instance, the dungeon master's guide and monster manual have a challenge rating system. A creature of a certain challenge rating is a decent challenge for a group of four players of that level, and you can slide the scale from there. Also, the DMG, or the Dungeon Master's Guide, has a experience threshold table in there as well that helps you build encounters based on the total experience points the creatures are fighting. So those are really cool resources, if you're new to the system and you're still trying to figure out how to balance that properly. Over time, eventually you'll just get a feel for it. Experience helps you get a little more comfortable with balancing the battle, and you want to make sure you don't kill all your players way too quickly in the game, either. There's also a really good website called Kobold Fight Club, for those who are running Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition campaigns, that helps them build an entire encounter with the experience table stuff that helps you get an idea of what could and could not be considered too powerful.

And don't forget, if you can't find a creature or monster in these realms or any sort of villain that suits your need for the storyline or this particular battle, you can create one. Make one up or take something that's there and customize it and alter it, make it more powerful, make it weaker, you know? If you really, really want to run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main villain, but all your players are level ten? Go ahead and make yourself some more powerful kobolds. You can customize 'em all you want. Everything in there is just a baseline suggestion of what they think, or they created initially to be, but you can always scale them, you can make them more powerful, you can add additional hit points, make them do more damage per attack. Increase their defenses, give it some hidden resistances or vulnerabilities. You can even create whole new abilities, I customize creatures all the time for my game. I think it, one, makes it more interesting and more customized to the specific encounter and world. Secondly, for players who have been playing for a long time and pretty much memorized the monster manual, it keeps them on their toes because they'll be encountering monsters that they have yet to memorize everything about. Also, make sure, though, if you do use these creatures and you want them to have interesting defenses and vulnerabilities and the like, make sure you highlight them or note them, it's very easy to rush into combat and forget some of these cool things. So I always use a highlighter and highlight the various notes and elements of these creatures or these combat scenarios that I want to make sure that I remember and recall in the heat of battle.

The next note I want to bring up is battlefields. First and foremost, not every game needs a battlefield. In fact, I kind of prefer RPGs that don't have a battle map with miniatures, it's just a way to play. I prefer to keep things in my imagination, but that's generally more wieldy with smaller groups, if you have three, maybe four players. Larger than that, it gets a little unwieldy, and me running six to eight players, it has become very necessary for everyone to keep track of their spatial awareness. When you create a map, things to consider, creative terrain. You know, think of where it's are happening, but ways to make it different on occasion, too. You can have straight forward battles with just, here's an area where they fight, here's some hallways, here's some rooms, and that's cool, too, but if you're in an urban setting, have furniture they can use to their advantage, whether it be for height or for setting up blockades. Also, consider what other challenges and confrontations they might have with the terrain during the battlefield. Is there a giant chasm they have to get across to actually get to the villain while they're attacking them from a distance? Is there some sort of arcane field that's locked off a portion of the battlefield and they have to figure out some sort of puzzle during the battle to lock it down? Is invulnerable to all damage until they can find some sort of hidden aspect of their soul locked within a nearby battlefield, or is there a bunch of innocents in there as well that are in danger of being killed from the collateral damage? Find cool and unique ways to make it an interesting battle outside of a slug fest of HP being knocked away and whoever falls first. Mind you, those can be fun, too, on occasion, but you want to make sure to keep things interesting.

For those who want to create battlefields, what I use for my battlefields, because it has been requested a few times. You can use easel pad paper, one-inch grid easel pad paper that you can find online, and that's a real cool way to draw on that using markers and create your own battlefields that way. There are great tutorials online too that show you how to make cool battles and interesting-looking terrain with simple hatch-mark shading and minor colors, so I highly recommend that.

Also, when you're using intelligent creatures, especially monsters or individuals or villains that are understanding their own mortality, they may flee. When they hit about half or a quarter hit points, they maybe want to get the heck out of Dodge. So don't be afraid to let your villains or enemies do that on occasion. One, it ups the stakes immediately in a battle from a slog fest to, oh crap he's getting away, and the dynamic shifts to try and prevent them from doing so. And secondly, if they do manage to get away, you may have a juicy villain who can recur later on down the story with a need for vengeance. Vengeance!

Another cool note, not all battles are meant to be won, either. Sometimes you want to introduce a really powerful enemy as a foreshadowing aspect, a creature that they can in no way, shape or form defeat, and they are meant to flee from, so that they can build towards down the road, maybe coming back and finally killing it as a means of vengeance. Just make sure you try and insinuate to the players that they shouldn't stick around for the whole fight or you might have a TPK on your hands, so be careful with that one. It's a fun tool, but be careful. No, seriously, be careful. Plus, it also leaves a cool story like, “Man, you remember that one time we almost got killed by that thing?”

Not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed, as well. So don't be afraid to let the players diplomatically resolve an encounter. Sometimes battles happen because of misunderstandings or misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it ticks somebody off. That doesn't mean they have to fight to the bitter end and murder whoever's in front of them. You don't want the whole murderhobo syndrome to be consistent, unless that's the campaign you're running, in which case, fight on, my murderhobos. But let the players use their ocial skills to try and defuse an encounter before anyone gets killed. I've many games where halfway through a battle, they're like, “Wait, they may have information we need,” or, “Maybe we were duped and have the wrong information,” and they decide to diplomatically end it. It doesn't always work, but it's nice to give them that option.
Part II

MATT: All righty guys, welcome back. So before jumping in here real fast, we got a couple things. One, we have a winner for our next giveaway, for all you awesome subscribers out there. The winner is Blackshadow773!

(cheering)

MATT: Appropriate place for a shoutout.

LAURA: That's really appropriate.

MATT: We'll send you an awesome package with a bunch of goodies, Critical Role goodies, some signed stuff, some fun things coming your way, so that's fun. Also, I forgot to do it in the announcements earlier, but I have a couple of new music tracks and some things coming forward that I'll be able to incorporate into the game from awesome guys named Battlebards. They did a Kickstarter a while back to create RPG-specific music and sound effects and audio tracks and they were nice enough to give me some of their stuff to use in the show. So if you're running your own game and want some good music and soundscape stuff to work on, Battlebards' got some pretty cool stuff, so thank you guys. All righty, so. Returning as it was, Grog and Vax, you make your way down to the basement of Greyskull Keep. The door's still partially ajar as Grog left it. You enter the room–

TRAVIS: Before we go in, I would like to put my hand on Vax. Just a note, I tried to do this by myself, but the skull asked for Percy. I know he didn't respond well with all that dark shadowy stuff, so be careful. I'm not entirely sure we can trust him with it. I wanted to do it myself, but it was either you or Keyleth, and you're a prick, so I picked you.

LIAM: I don't say anything.

MATT: Okay. You guys enter. Percy is there waiting, hands behind his back. There is the table on one of his workbench areas that has a piece of tapestry that you guys originally had wrapped the skull in, draped over it, it's currently not visible.

LIAM: What's going on, Percival?

TALIESIN: Good. I felt that this was only possible if we had a few more witnesses. We have an artifact.

LIAM: Good.

TALIESIN: A skull. There is something alive inside the skull. There is something evil, or at least not good, inside the skull, and it is offering to grant us any wish we desire if we set it free. Now. Grog is inclined to take this deal. I am, and I imagine this is surprising, having some reservations. I like having the terms spelled out, and I feel that so far the terms have not been spelled out. I'm going to lift the fabric off.

TRAVIS: I go and shut the door.

MATT: Okay, and as you lift the fabric off, and you have a look at it as well, in this controlled environment, still facing you, the skull, which once again has the elongated form, the longer teeth and jaw, it has the one gem that's embedded in the eye socket, and you can see there's a little bit of almost like a spectral swirl to it, like there's something fluid in the actual gem itself.

LIAM: Well, Freddie, I imagine I'm wondering the same thing you are, at least I hope, and that's: what's in it for the skull?

TALIESIN: He wants to be freed. It. How would we free you?

MATT: There's a slight pause before you can see the gem, the swirl coalesces into what looks like a spectral face. You can make out what looks to be eyes, a mouth and a nose. Though the nose itself is less of a pronounced human nose and–

LIAM: I'm looking at the floor, I'm not looking at it.

MATT: Okay. But you see where the nose is, instead there are two nasal passages. And you hear a voice slowly creak out from it and say, “All that I require is for you to destroy this prison. Free my spirit from generations of torment, that is all I ask.”

LIAM: Hey, quick question, who are you? Who were you before you were in this prison?

MATT: “It's been too long, too long have I been here, I do not know who I am.”

LIAM: Ah, well, go fuck yourself. And I put the blanket over it.

MATT: The blanket covers the skull.

LIAM: This seems like a very bad idea to me. Why are we doing this? Didn't we do this already, once before?

TALIESIN: It was an option, and I felt it was worth exploring, and I think now we do have an option, which is we have to take it somewhere and have him identified. We have to know who this is.

TRAVIS: What are you talking about? If it wants to be set free, fuck him, it's a wish. It's like a genie that wants out of a can, you don't grant it its wish, you get your fucking wish first.

TALIESIN: It's not always genies in cans.

LIAM: If we wish to rid Emon of these dragons, then we've got nothing to deal with this fucking thing right here, whatever it is.

TALIESIN: I would like to know before we make any deals, we need a name.

TRAVIS: Hold on, hold on, hold on, look, we have a chance to do good now, right now. People are dying. More people are dying.

TALIESIN: We have a chance to kick the can down the road.

TRAVIS: I don't understand.

LIAM: He's speaking literally, Grog.

TALIESIN: We don't know that whatever is in here could be worse than what's out there.

LIAM: I had a thought–

TALIESIN: But we could find out, and since it's a wish, we'll have plenty of room to fix this. We don't have to do it immediately.

TRAVIS: Are you a betting man, Percival?

TALIESIN: Yes.

TRAVIS: If I told you that four giant ancient fuck-off death dragons were attacking the city and all of us barely managed to break one of its pinky toes, you're saying what's in there is worse than them?

TALIESIN: I don't know. It's in there, isn't it? And how do we know the dragons weren't guarding it as opposed to it being a signal? It could be the thing they're angry about.

LIAM: I think– I have a thought I haven't spoken out loud yet. Every divine being that exists is accessible through Vasselheim. We are not equipped to handle this problem. Maybe this skull will do something, maybe, that's a bit fucking maybe. We're not equipped, and we don't know what dealing with that thing will bring. We will go to Vasselheim tomorrow. We bring all the people in this keep with us, Keyleth sends them through the tree. They stay there, we find help. We cannot handle this on our own. My first instinct was to go back in for Uriel. We don't know what's happened to Uriel! But we can't do it, we are powerless against those things. Against one of them, let alone four. We need help.

TALIESIN: I wave my hand, and the skull drops into a shadow on the table and vanishes.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: Did that blanket just blob down?

TALIESIN: The blanket vanished into the shadow as well, it's now just a shadow. I've put it back in its hiding place.

TRAVIS: What the fuck was that?

TALIESIN: That was a reminder that you should know what you're dealing with before you touch power.

TRAVIS: Can you do magic?

TALIESIN: Yes. I'm not going to pretend I always make the best calls. But I at least would like to know its name.

TRAVIS: (sighs) Fucking pussy. We have a chance to save this city now.

TALIESIN: We have a chance to stop anything worse from happening, or we have a chance to unleash something far worse on it.

LIAM: Grog, know your strengths, it is your strength–

TALIESIN: I am a betting man, and this is a bad bet.

TRAVIS: Can I walk up to the shadow table?

MATT: Yeah, yeah.

TRAVIS: Can I start looking around it? Do I see anything?

MATT: It looks like there's the dark spot on the table, and as you reach your hand out, it's just a solid table.

LIAM: I look at Percival. We need to talk to the girls.

MATT: And as you reach your hand past that into the shadow, because I assume that this is the–

TALIESIN: You know exactly what I did. Is he reaching or is he–

TRAVIS: I did not reach, I'm looking on top of it, on the sides, underneath.

MATT: Yeah, currently it looks like literally where the cloth and skull once were, there is a dark spot and shadow.

TRAVIS: No button, no latches, no holes for quarters?

MATT: Nope.

LAURA: I'm knocking on the door.

TALIESIN: Your plan is good. It just requires a little bit more study. It's a good plan.

TRAVIS: Study.

LAURA: Are you in there?

TALIESIN: Yes, come, please come in.

LAURA: I open the door.

MATT: Unlocked, Vex walks in.

LAURA: Well, what's this big master plan you're all plotting?

TALIESIN: Vex. Vax, do you want to– Well, actually, we might as well get Keyleth down here as well.

LIAM: Pike as well.

TALIESIN: Pike, Keyleth, meet me in my– I'm going to walk and attempt to gently scoop the skull up and put it behind me.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: To catch things up, I walk out the door and I'm going to get the other two.

LAURA: Did I notice that, I have a really good passive perception?

MATT: You do, you see him scoot go over to the table and move something behind his back.

TRAVIS: Who did?

(laughter)

MATT: You don't know. You head up to the main foyer area where the stairs come up through the armory and lead into to the main hallway that bisects the center of the main floor, just as Keyleth and Pike are coming out of the temple after being summoned.

LIAM: All right, I beeline right up to them and I drop down in front of Pike. Pike. Keyleth. We're working on a plan, and we don't have one yet, but Pike– and I'm down on my knee– you need to guide Grog. He doesn't listen to anyone else, he only listens to you.

MARISHA: Is something wrong?

LIAM: Yes and no. It's better if you just come. Pike, come.

ASHLEY and MARISHA: Okay.

LIAM: And I take Keyleth's hand and pull her after me.

TRAVIS: Who's in the room right now?

MATT: Right now it's just you, Percy, and Vex.

TRAVIS: I shut the door.

MATT: Okay. Grog walks over and closes the door.

TRAVIS: I want that skull. I want it now.

LAURA: This is about the skull, then?

TRAVIS: Yeah. Percy's trying to do some fucked-up shit with the skull.

MARISHA: Wait, did you close the door?

TRAVIS: I did.

MATT: You guys aren't there yet. This hasn't happened yet, you guys are still walking down the stairs.

TALIESIN: He can't lock it.

TRAVIS: No, but I can stand in front of it. I want the skull, right now.

TALIESIN: Let me see your sword.

TRAVIS: No, you don't want to see the sword.

LAURA: Oh shit.

TALIESIN: I point at the table and I say: reach into the shadow and see if you can take the skull.

TRAVIS: No, I don't think so, your water fucked me up last time. You get it out of the table.

LAURA: Can I insight check them to see who is fucking with who–

TALIESIN: Good luck.

LAURA: – and who has better intentions right now?

MATT: Sure.

LAURA: Double insight check? Okay, the gold one is for Percy, and the thorny one is for Grog.

LIAM: Naturally.

LAURA: Whoa! Good for both of them, motherfucker! The gold one is a 27 for Percy and– 15 plus eight, what is 15 plus eight?

LIAM: 15 plus eight is naturally 23.

LAURA: 23 for Grog.

MATT: Okay, I rolled it for both of them. Was one of those a natural 20?

LAURA: No, but one of them is 27 and 23.

MATT: Right, 27 and 23, okay, good. Looking at them both, they're still very guarded and you are unable to really–

LAURA: Both of them? Seriously, Matt?

MATT: Yeah. I mean, it doesn't absolve any of your suspicion by any means, but they're both locked in this intense stare-off and you in the center of it as you dart back and forth to try and see any give, any twitch, anything that would possibly show an ounce of what is going on in their heads. It's the best poker faces you've seen on either of them in a while.

LIAM: Are we at the door yet?

MATT: You guys are now getting to the door.

LIAM: Hey, big man, Trickfoot wants to talk to you.

TALIESIN: I look Grog right in the eye before they come in. I very quietly say: does your friend have an opinion on the skull?

TRAVIS: Which friend?

TALIESIN: Your new friend.

LAURA: What the fuck? What the fuck is going on?! What fucking friend and–

TRAVIS: Vex.

LAURA: I saw you, Percival.

TALIESIN: You did.

MARISHA: I put my ear to the door. Can I hear them a little bit?

MATT: You guys can hear shouting from the other side, but it's too thick.

ASHLEY: Can I try opening it?

MATT: Yeah, it's unlocked, and you open the door and it stops as if there's a door stop directly behind it. You feel the door slamming you in the back, Grog.

TRAVIS: Okay.

TALIESIN: Or pick who you trust. I trust your judgment.

TRAVIS: Trust? Vex, listen to me. What did you see?

LAURA: Who's your friend?

TRAVIS: (sighs) The skull grants a wish. It can only be used by those with dark presence around them. That's Percy, that's me. How has Percy done with dark shit in the past? I went to him for help because I'm trying to free the city of these fucking dragons, but it wanted Percy. I tried to keep it for myself. And now he's up to his shady shit all over again.

LAURA: It specifically wants Percy?

TRAVIS: It wanted Percy.

TALIESIN: And I said 'no.'

TRAVIS: The hell you did.

MARISHA: (yelling) Wait, who wanted who?

ASHLEY: Can we wiggle in?

MATT: You can try to, but Grog, you hold the door shut? The door's not moving.

LIAM: Okay, I'm going to quick, rapid-fire– I was hoping to bring everybody in, but say: listen to me. Percy's got this fucking skull and we– Everything about it. It's a skull, it's talking about granting a wish, it's fucking fucked up just like the fucking smoke demon that was in Percival. I don't understand what's going on yet, but both Grog and Percival are a little fucked up, but Grog is more fucked up, but I don't understand everything. But things are not good.

MARISHA: What?

ASHLEY: What's going on?

MARISHA: Hearing Vax unload that information, if I reach through the crack in the door, can I touch Grog?

MATT: There's just enough of a gap where you could probably get an arm through.

MARISHA: Like my tiny little female hand.

MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

ASHLEY: Can I push the door open? Or at least try?

MATT: Try to. Pike, make a strength check.

ASHLEY: Yeah, go first, go first.

MARISHA: I reach through, and if I can grab Grog, I cast Hold Person on him.

TRAVIS: Cool, I'll stay right where I am.

MARISHA: Well– Then we can push him over, right?

MATT: You can try, yeah. All right, so. Hold Person: does it require–

TRAVIS: I weigh like 600 pounds.

MARISHA: There's three of us, we can push real hard.

LIAM: We can get Jarett.

MATT: All right. So, looking at Hold Person here, hold on just a second.

MARISHA: Oh, wait! Wait, can I redact that? Can I redact that?

TRAVIS: No, you already said it.

MATT: It has to be a humanoid you can see within range. So you couldn't even Hold Person through the door.

MARISHA: Beautiful– Even better.

TALIESIN: You read the spell, didn't you?

LIAM: Scanlan, Scanlan, join us. Please, quickly, please.

MATT: Scanlan goes, “I'm trying to help some folks, but if you insist, all right.”

LIAM: I do, I do insist.

TRAVIS: Vex. If he has the skull, we've got to get it from him now.

LAURA: Percy?

TALIESIN: I have the skull. I'm not going to use it, I don't trust him not to use it, yet.

LAURA: How about you guys give me the skull, I'm not even touched by anything dark.

TRAVIS: That's a great idea.

TALIESIN: That's fair.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Give her the skull.

TALIESIN: All right, I pull it out from behind me and hand it to you. It's in the bag, wrapped in cloth.

LAURA: Oh god. I'm going to get fucking attacked by Grog. I'm going to back up into a corner and hold on to it and look down at it.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: I'm holding onto it? Jesus.

MATT: You are holding onto it, and it's wrapped in the tapestry that you guys threw over it originally, but you can feel it in your hands, and it's not terribly heavy, it has some heft to it, and just having it there, you're already getting pins and needles on the back of your neck.

LIAM: Now, Shorthalt, now.

MARISHA: Is he trying to bamf in? Scanlan?

MATT: No, no. So, Pike, what are you doing?

ASHLEY: I want to try and push in the door open.

MATT: Okay. Make a strength check. Grog, make a strength check.

ASHLEY: With all my strength.

TALIESIN: I love you, Travis.

(laughter)

MARISHA: While she pushes, can I get up against the crack to see if I can see through while she pushes?

TRAVIS: 17.

ASHLEY: Eight.

MATT: The door lurches, but you hold it solidly in place. You can feel–

ASHLEY: Grog! Let me in!

TRAVIS: Just a fuck– just a minute!

ASHLEY: I've been waiting five minutes!

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Put your pants on, Grog, really.

LIAM: Just another minute, mom.

LAURA: I think this is probably the stupidest thing, why did I decide to hold it?

TRAVIS: Give me the skull, you don't want Percy to have it.

LAURA: I don't want either of you to have it.

TALIESIN: Don't give me the skull, but don't give him the skull either.

TRAVIS: If you want to, you can ask it what it wants, and then you'll know, or you can give it to me and we can be done with this.

MARISHA: Are we trying to hand Grog the evil things?

LAURA: I take the tapestry off it and I ask it, what the fuck do you want? What the fuck are you? What the fuck is this?

MATT: As you look down at the skull, which you guys still can't get through because Grog's holding the door, and you don't have a visual in there because he's holding it pretty close to completely shut. As you look down, you can see now in the gem, formulating in the middle of it, this swirl of a face that comes right up to the front. You can see in the midst of its coloration these energy-based eyes and grin, a toothy grin that goes, “I wish to be freed. That is all. I've been here far too long. I grow tired. I want to finally pass.”

LAURA: Are you Vecna?

MATT: You hear a chuckle. “No. Vecna has been long gone. I am not a being of such power.”

LAURA: Can I insight check the fucking thing in the eyeball?

MATT: Sure, make a insight check.

LAURA: Sure, no problem. Unless it was a natural 20, it doesn't matter, 15, no.

MATT: 15, you don't.

LAURA: No. Way higher than 15, 21.

MATT: Okay. 21, thank you.

LAURA: 22, I can add.

MATT: 22, okay, that's way higher. You take a look at it, but due to the fact that it's mostly hidden, there aren't facial tics and there aren't normal gives to what a person's intent is, and even the tone of voice itself is spectral, ominous and otherworldly. You have a hard time being able to read whether or not it's being honest or lying or anything in between.

LIAM: Scanlan here yet?

LAURA: Why would we free it?

MATT: Scanlan is now behind the door on the other side, and he enters the room with you guys and is like, “What's going on, everything cool?”

LIAM: Wait, the door is open now?

MATT: No, he's with you guys.

LIAM: Ah good, yeah, Bigby that shit.

TRAVIS: I bum rush Vex.

ASHLEY: No, Dimension Door me in, please.

TALIESIN: I think we need a name for the thing.

TRAVIS: I bum rush Vex.

TALIESIN: I'm using quick draw.

MARISHA: What?

MATT: Initiative rolls from both of you guys.

TALIESIN: Yeah!

MARISHA: Does this mean the door flies open?

ASHLEY: Yeah, the door flies open.

MATT: Just a moment.

LIAM: This is all seconds, this is happening in seconds.

TRAVIS: 14.

LAURA: Do I roll anything? Can I do anything?

TALIESIN: 28.

TRAVIS: Ugh, Jesus. 28?!

MATT: I'll say roll with disadvantage, because it catches you entirely off-guard.

LAURA: So this is a surprise attack. Ugh, that's lame. That was just 13.

MATT: Okay, and you had a–?

TRAVIS: 14.

MATT: 14, okay. All right, so, you see Grog lower his head and then go for a burst run across the length of the workshop towards Vex. You instinctually go quick draw, what are you doing?

TALIESIN: I'm shooting a warning shot past his head, diving in, taking the–

LAURA: Are you close enough? I backed into a corner.

TALIESIN: I've got six spaces of movement in my turn.

MATT: Yeah, it's not a big room.

TALIESIN: Diving and grabbing the head and curling back around–

TRAVIS: The head? The skull?

TALIESIN: Grabbing the skull and going–

TRAVIS: She's 50/50 distance between us.

TALIESIN: I'm moving first.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: And I'm happy to spend an action surge if that'll make this work better.

LAURA: Do you think you can just grab it from me?

LIAM: D&D standoff.

TALIESIN: I can make a roll for it.

MATT: So, as you dart, Percy is waiting for someone to also dart, and both of you go rushing across the room. Percy manages to get there a fraction of a second before you do. You hear the blast of his pistol past your ear, and the ringing hits the center of your head, but you still continue pushing forward in the way that Grog does, ignoring all outside interference. However, you've gotten to the skull first. Are you going to attempt to wrestle it from her?

TALIESIN: Gently pull it out of his run. So I'm going pull it–

LAURA: Are you going to try to pull me out of the way or just the fucking skull, you dick?

MATT: She's pretty grappled to it.

TALIESIN: Oh, if she's that grappled to it, then I'm going to try and push her out of the way of Grog.

MATT: Okay, opposed strength checks from both of you.

LAURA: From me?

MATT: Yeah, make a strength check.

TRAVIS: He doesn't seem to care much.

LAURA: He really, really doesn't.

TALIESIN: 15.

LAURA: Ah, that's terrible– nine.

TALIESIN: It's less of a shove and more of a pull out of the way of Grog's rush.

MATT: Right, so, he reaches over and grabs the skull in your arm and pulls you–

TALIESIN: Well, I grab her.

MATT: Right, she– but you haven't pulled it from her grip, you pull her out of the way. Shoves you to the side. You go rushing forward, and as you get there, she is pulled to the side, she is still right there in front of you, but the bum rush didn't get you there before anybody could react. So now it's your turn.

LAURA: It's my turn?

MATT: Yeah. Wait, you rolled a 13?

LAURA: I rolled a 13.

MATT: Oh, never mind, Grog goes next. Grog, so you rush up and you can now see Percy, pistol out, hand on the side of Vex, off the side of her arm. She's holding the skull there and they're both looking at you expectantly. What are you doing to do?

TRAVIS: I want Percy. I'm going to tackle Percy.

MATT: You what?

TRAVIS: I am going to run straight towards Percy and tackle him.

MATT: Tackle him, okay, all right. So, let's get some proper rumble music for this.

MARISHA: There are dragons outside and we're fighting, playing rugby with a fucking skull.

TRAVIS: I'm trying to fix the dragons.

MATT: Okay, so you use the momentum of the rush and you see him do this, you turn out of the way and go for a shoulder shove. I want you to go ahead and make an attack roll. Actually, make an athletics roll versus your acrobatics.

TRAVIS: Why can't that be higher? 19.

TALIESIN: Ah shit, 14.

MATT: 14, I need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

TALIESIN: Oh shit. 17, oh, saving throw. 21.

MATT: 21. You slam into him and you essentially shove him with the shoulder. You manage to knock him prone, but the skull doesn't come loose, he loses his grip on it, and currently Vex is still holding it front of you. You're prone on the ground.

TALIESIN: I'm prone on the ground?

TRAVIS: So Vex still has it?

TALIESIN: But it's Vex's turn.

TRAVIS: But I knocked him off of her. But you've still got the skull.

TALIESIN: I wasn't trying to wrestle it.

MATT: Anything else you want to try and accomplish?

TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to turn and put my back to Vex, because she has the skull.

MATT: Okay. So you go and plant a protective position in front of her? It's now your turn. Grog, who rushes over and shoulder slams Percy out of the way, and he's fallen to the ground. His gun almost scatters to the floor of the workshop around you. As you're expecting, he turns towards you, instead he steps and his giant frame is now blocking you with the shoulder blades in front, his arms out in a defensive position, facing off with people as they begin to enter the room. What are you going to do?

LAURA: I reach up and I touch his back. And I say: are you yourself?

TRAVIS: Me?

LAURA: Yes, you, fuck!

TRAVIS: Yeah, yes, fuck, it's me.

LAURA: I back up into a corner, and I say: what is all this about? Why do you even need this? Why do we want to set it free? I don't understand.

TRAVIS: We don't, we don't, we just don't want him to have Percy.

MARISHA: The rest of us see this now, right?

MATT: At this point now, the door's burst open, and the rest of you guys rush in and you can see Percy just as he hits the ground. You can see Grog recovering from the shoulder slam, who then steps in front of Vex with this snarl on his face and begins shouting to her over his shoulder, and you hear them talking across the room.

TALIESIN: It doesn't want me, I don't want to use the skull. I want to keep you from using it.

ASHLEY: What is going on in here?!

MARISHA: Keyleth cracks her staff on the floor and does a Gust cantrip and goes (whoosh) to make a big burst of wind in the room.

MATT: Okay. Tools go falling off the wall and clattering to the stone floor of the establishment. All of you who have hair have it blown and wrapped around you. You are pushed back about three inches from the burst of it, and all of you, immediately, your attention goes to Keyleth who stands there with her staff.

TRAVIS: Is it dusty in there now? Or is it just windy?

MATT: It's not dusty, it's covered in layers of soot that have now been kicked up, and the air itself is a temporary fume.

TRAVIS: Do we have an order?

MARISHA: Silence!

MATT: She does that. Pike, what are you doing?

ASHLEY: Can I insight-check Grog?

MATT: Yeah, go for it.

ASHLEY: 21.

MATT: What are you trying to know?

TRAVIS: What are you trying to know?

ASHLEY: I want to know why he wants this skull so bad.

MATT: Okay. If you would like to relay any information, she peered pretty well into your demeanor.

TRAVIS: I want to get rid of the dragons, now.

MATT: So you gather that he's coming from a place that a simple mind is looking for a simple solution to a complex problem.

(laughter)

LAURA: “I'm right here, Matt.”

TALIESIN: Burn, burn!

TRAVIS: Oh, oh, the flames, ah!

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Stop, drop, and roll!

MATT: I'm saying that's the best way she can discern your demeanor right now. Pike, anything else you want to do right now? We have to continue this.

ASHLEY: Yep. Can I walk over and grab Craven Edge?

MATT: Craven Edge is currently sheathed on his back, away from you. So you can attempt to, if you want to.

ASHLEY: Grog, can you give me Craven Edge, please?

MATT: Pike, hands out to you and looking you earnestly in the face.

TRAVIS: Why?

ASHLEY: I just want to look at it.

MARISHA: Pike, you sure about this?

ASHLEY: I just want to see, something's not quite right.

TALIESIN: Can I get up at this point or no?

MATT: We are about to get back to the top of the round. So you do what you're doing, okay. Percy.

TALIESIN: I'm going to stand up and grab a poker off the table. I'm leaving my gun on the floor.

MATT: Not off the table, the wind gust knocked off a lot of these things on the ground. Small pile of tools next to you. So you grab the poker.

TALIESIN: I grab a poker and I take a corner.

MATT: Okay. So now, Percy, you've squared off into a corner, there's Vex in the other corner, Grog's standing in between the two with the back against Vex. The three of you are right there at the front. Pike has stepped up to Grog now and is beseeching him. That's Percy. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: I look at Pike. I turn around, I look at Vex. You'll thank me. And I'd like to try and pull the skull out of her hands.

MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check against her.

LAURA: Oh jeez, oh come on. There's no way, even if I roll like a– Unless I get a 20.

TRAVIS: 21.

LAURA: No, that's 14.

MATT: All right. As Grog turns around and gives you almost an apologetic look, his face steels over with intensity as, lightning-fast, his muscular arms rush out in front, grasp the skull. Like tearing a toy from a child's grasp, it is removed from you with barely any sort of resistance.

MARISHA: Can I get a spell off on him?

MATT: Not yet. So Grog, that's your action. You grab and you have now the skull. You left her with the tapestry, like you have just the bare skull in front of you.

TRAVIS: What would I like to do with it?

MATT: You have a bonus action, so depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

TRAVIS: Can I spike it?

MATT: You can, yeah, I'd say yeah.

TALIESIN: That's a bonus action?

MATT: I'd say this would be your movement and bonus, I'll let you do that, the whole thing together.

TRAVIS: I would like to spike the skull.

TALIESIN: Oh Jesus.

MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check.

LAURA: You're just going to–

TRAVIS: What are the fucking chances?!

MATT: A natural one?

LAURA: Yes.

(laughter)

MATT: As you reach up, at the apex of your throw you look down and–

TRAVIS: I don't believe it. I don't fucking believe it.

MATT: Your eyes catch Pike, and during that brief moment of slow-motion as you reach up, you see her face, this look of complete, heartbreaking disappointment. Just like that. It shakes you in a way that you didn't expect, and as you go through the motion you already anticipated, and your brain's already wandered in doing so. You slam it half-heartedly and it bounces and skids across the ground, over by where Keyleth is.

MARISHA: Is it rolling at my feet?

LAURA: I run and jump for it.

MATT: All right, so. It's not your turn, it's the end of your turn. As it goes rolling, you run and dodge, go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

LIAM: Damn it.

LAURA: 23.

MATT: 23, all right. You jump out of the way, tumble, roll, and scoop up it in your arms once more, and you have it.

MARISHA: Can I get a spell off?

MATT: You have to get to your turn. Is that all you're going to do?

LAURA: That was all of it? Can I run out of the room? If I can move. I'm going to run towards the door.

MATT: I'd say, yeah. With the tumble and everything, you have just enough movement to get out of the room. So Vex goes darting out of the workshop, just past the door, leaving the room. That brings us now to–

LIAM: Relay race. Okay, then I take a step in front of her and pull out my daggers and stand in front of my sister.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: What the fuck is happening? Seeing all of this happen, I cast Hold Person.

TRAVIS: Stop trying to protect the skull.

MARISHA: At 4th-level.

MATT: To? Against?

MARISHA: Against Percy, Grog–

LAURA: I'm out of the room, you can't see me.

LIAM: I'm in.

MARISHA: How far away are they? Can I turn around and see–

MATT: I'd say she just got out of the room, you would have visual on her as she's leaving the room, yeah.

MARISHA: What about Vax?

MATT: Yeah, Vax is standing in front of her, you have visual on both, technically.

TRAVIS: Don't do this.

LIAM: This is so metal.

MARISHA: Vex. Vex. Sorry, Vex.

MATT: All right, I need a wisdom saving throw from all three of you.

LIAM: Wait, me too?

LAURA: No, just me. Yeah, you fucks are still mobile.

TRAVIS: Natural 20.

MATT: Boom, Percy?

TALIESIN: 15.

MATT: 15, that's a failure.

LAURA: 21.

MATT: So Percy, your muscles tense up, and as you're holding your poker, you find yourself unable to move. Grog, you feel and look over and see Keyleth as she looks towards you with intensity, and you feel a similar tremor across your head, but you shrug it off.

TRAVIS: These fucking sensations today.

MATT: Yeah, it's weird. Vex, you as well, you glance over your shoulder as you hear Keyleth muttering under her breath, and you can feel that familiar sensation of the magical attempt to grasp your mind. Your half-elven self makes it even easier to shrug off, and you continue darting forth the direction you are with your brother behind you. So you're protecting her?

LIAM: Oh yes, I'm barring the way

LAURA: So we're right up the hallway from our prison cell, right?

MATT: Correct. I haven't got to your turn yet, though. So, does that end your turn? Do you want to move?

MARISHA: Can I say something?

MATT: If you want to, yeah

MARISHA: Everyone, stop, why are we fighting? We just watched our city burn to the ground. What are we fighting over?

TRAVIS: We're not fighting, they're trying to protect the skull.

MARISHA: What does this look like? What does this look like to you?

TRAVIS: A statue garden?

MARISHA: Everyone, get in Percy's workshop and we're going to talk this out.

MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

LAURA: Keyleth, you don't know what's happening.

MARISHA: I would if any of my fucking party would for once tell me something. You all didn't tell me the full fucking story when we went back into General Krieg's house, and now look what happened. Look what happened because you assholes aren't communicating.

TALIESIN: (muffled mumbling)

MARISHA: Shut up, Percy!

(laughter)

MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

MARISHA: This is because of us, and you all know it is. Let's figure this out. Go, Pike.

(laughter)

ASHLEY: Grog, did you just say you want to protect the skull?

TRAVIS: No, I want to break the skull. I want to get rid of the dragons

ASHLEY: Okay, what were you trying to do when you brought Percy and Vex up here?

LIAM: Vax.

TRAVIS: It needed someone with a dark touch. But now it's–

ASHLEY: To do what?

TRAVIS: To get the wish, but now it's touching everyone, they're trying to protect the skull, and we don't want that. We want it broken, I think.

ASHLEY: But you want the wish?

TRAVIS: Yeah, we want the wish, we can do whatever we want to with the wish and not take it, but yeah.

ASHLEY: There has to be some type of payment, if we take a wish.

TRAVIS: Well, it didn't say anything about a payment. There are four dragons killing everything.

MATT: At this point, as you guys are having this conversation, and you guys are darting out, Vex, you stop, as coming down the stairs from the main floor is Erwen. Frazzled, but still put together as well as he can.

LAURA: I tuck it behind my back.

MATT: “I'm sorry, Lady Vex'ahlia, it appears you have a few guests, suddenly.”

LAURA: What? What kind of guests?

MATT: “She's been here before. I don't recognize the other; in the dining area.”

LAURA: What does she look like?

MATT: “Blonde hair.”

TRAVIS: Allura.

MATT: “Dwarven individual.”

MARISHA: Oh my god, it's Allura and Kima.

LIAM: This is a little like Clue: the Movie.

LAURA: It kind of is. Yes– Erwen. Bring them down here. It's an emergency

MATT: “Very well, I'll–”

LAURA: As quickly as possible.

MATT: “Yes, yes.” And he turns around and hustles up the stairs.

MARISHA: Can we all please go back in Percy's workshop?

LAURA: Not yet, darling.

MARISHA: Why not?

LIAM: Keyleth, let's just wait until Allura gets here. I feel like she might have a calming effect on this situation, an outside eye.

MARISHA: We are standing in the damn hall, all I am asking is that we move into a quiet room.

MATT: At this point now, at the top of the stairway, two individuals come walking down. First and foremost, you see a dwarven male with short black hair and a beard, trimmed fairly fine, red leathers, carrying some sort of crooked wand on the side. Behind him you see, hair tossed back as she rushes down after him, Arcanist Allura Vysoren.

LIAM: I sheath my daggers.

MATT: Okay. She looks about curiously and the dwarf goes, “Okay, what have we stepped into here?” And Allura puts her hand on his shoulder and goes, “Don't worry. I apologize for my intrusion. I had a– is everything all right?”

LAURA: We could use your help at this moment.

MATT: “Certainly. Sorry, this is a long-time friend of mine, Elementalist Drake Thunderbrand. If you don't mind him accompanying us as well?”

LAURA: Is he good?

MATT: “Oh, he's one of the finest.”

LAURA: A good person?

MATT: “I've put my life in his hands a number of times, yes.”

LIAM: Things are a lot more complicated than you can even imagine. Please come in, we need you.

MATT: “Yes, yes.” And as you guys are having this standoff, you watch as this black-haired, red-leathered dwarf walks in, looking around and inspecting intently. You don't recognize him, you've never seen him before

TRAVIS: What's he wielding?

MATT: No weapons on him. You see him clutching this gnarled, curved wand that almost spirals, like a piece of well-treated but messed up wood.

TRAVIS: A stick.

LAURA: That's a weapon.

MATT: Maybe. And Allura rushes in, muttering under her breath, “I was just in Whitestone and I had a terrible feeling come over me and all my teleportation sigils within the city were suddenly severed. Both my tower and the Lyceum. I had to manually teleport us here as it was the only place I really had enough familiarity with far enough away from the city in case something bad had happened, I hope you don't mind.”

LAURA: Not at all. We're grateful for your help.

LIAM: Could you do us a favor? We had a small accident with Percival.

LAURA: Not yet, not yet.

TRAVIS: Does she know about the– D–?

LIAM: No. So… Emon is in ruins. It's been destroyed by dragons.

LAURA: Four. Ancient. Dragons.

MARISHA: They call themselves the Chroma Conclave.

LIAM: And your tower is–

TRAVIS: Fucked!

LAURA: We're sorry.

MARISHA: I'll go ahead and drop the Hold Person on Percy.

MATT: And her face goes white, the blood runs from her entire complexion, and you can see the dwarf that initially was huffed up and intense in his energy, while not fully understanding what's going on, looks over to Allura and softens and walks up and puts his hand on her shoulder. “You okay, lass?”

LIAM: I'm sorry, my lady. Did you know that Uriel planned to step down?

MATT: “He threatened it–”

LIAM: He did it.

MATT: “– for weeks– what?”

LIAM: He did it, and moments later four old dragons descended upon the city.

MARISHA: The Cloudtop District has been demolished.

MATT: “This cannot be.”

MARISHA: We don't know who all is alive or dead. We can only expect the worst.

MATT: “This cannot be.”

LAURA: Unfortunately, Allura, all of that is the reason for our current impasse. We seem to have discovered something that could potentially reverse the situation. But there's a great price to pay. It could be a small price to pay, we don't know. If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this relic that we discovered.

MATT: And you see, she is still lost in thought and there's something in her mind that's distracting her immensely, but she eventually clarifies and her eyes focus on you once more and she goes, “Of course, please.”

LAURA: I don't give it to her, but I pull the tapestry off of the skull and show it to her.

MATT: She looks at it and leans forward and begins muttering something beneath her breath, and she goes into technical mode, like she distracts herself with work at this moment. And as her brow furrows, she mutters under her breath and completes some sort of flash of arcane energy, and you can see the flash of energy attaches around the skull for a second and glints back at her, and she goes, “Right, all right, that's– That skull is not human, that skull is Githyanki. That is a species that exists primarily on the Astral Plane. They're rowdy, evil, pirating, marauding individuals, and that's one sense. The gem within that skull appears to be a soul gem and contains the soul of, from what I can gather, a Githyanki individual. Very old. I can say at least from my knowledge and learned opinion that no good can come from such an artifact.”

LAURA: Okay. He can grant a wish, he says? Lying, truth? What do you think?

MATT: “It's hard to say. It would take a very powerful individual to do so, however, I would say that wishes granted by entities that do not correspond with your moral outlook for the most part rarely end up in your favor, even when carefully worded.”

LAURA: Right. No, but I remember this, we dealt with this with the demon that killed Pike.

MARISHA: Yes, but we used our wish to wish ourselves out of that contract.

LAURA: And it had to be so carefully worded.

MARISHA: We can destroy more, if we're not careful.

MATT: “There have been powerful individuals, who upon obtaining the ability to make such a wish, even as careful as they were, they reached beyond the means of its magic, and doing so, undid themselves. It's a very, very powerful, very dangerous magic, and if this entity is indeed even capable of doing so, who's to say the chances that it wouldn't wreak more havoc than you intended?”

LIAM: We are in a precarious position. The city is in ruins, already, in a matter of hours.

MATT: “Yes, yes.”

MARISHA: What do we do?

MATT: And at this point, she looks around for a chair. You can see her hands are shaking, and she goes and grabs a chair and pulls it up and sits down for a second, puts her hands on her knees, and quietly, “Describe to me these dragons.”

MARISHA: There was one of each color.

LAURA: A green, a black, a white.

TRAVIS: And a big red piece of shit.

MARISHA: All colors except for blue of the chromatic spectrum. I got a few of their names.

MATT: As you go through each color, she nods, but when you say the big red, her body freezes.

MARISHA: Does this sound familiar to you?

MATT: “The names, you said?”

MARISHA: There's a white dragon that called himself Vorugal. A green dragon, Raishan. Black dragon, Umbrasyl, and the red dragon, we haven't heard his name yet. He seems to be the leader.

MATT: At this point she nods and goes, “I know not the middle two, but Vorugal has been known to wander the wastes north in Othanzia. Some of the offspring have wandered further, in fact I believe the Skysunder that you destroyed naught but two years ago that was sealed in the Frostweald was one of its brethren. Its children. But Vorugal has not been seen wandering this far out. Chromatics do not work together, they are selfish and greedy and territorial.”

LAURA: They're definitely working together.

MATT: “This red you say is the leader?”

LIAM: Yes, most definitely.

MARISHA: He had a message that he belted over the entire city. He said that we who live, he's showing mercy and that we can either fight or flee, and then–

LAURA: He said if we fight or flee, we'll be denied the mercy.

MARISHA: Okay, something along those lines. And then he said that it was the guardians of this city that brought this upon Emon, and that he has control. He called it like a new order.

LAURA: He said our new purpose is to serve him.

MATT: Now for the first time, you have known Allura for quite some time, she's been a very stoic, strong, confident, and powerful person. At this moment, she has withered. She looks genuinely like she's hit a level of fear you have never seen in an individual like this, and it shakes you to see this upon her face, and she puts her hand up and says, “This is not your fault. This burden is mine.” And looks over to the dwarf and says, “It is ours.” And the dwarf, you can now see, he's nodding in understanding. “This dragon… it's been called many names, but the one that it's taken is Thordak, The Cinder King.”

MARISHA: Thordak?

MATT: “Thordak. This terrible beast lorded over half of Marquet for centuries, taking the scalding sands as its domain and its denizens as cattle, and just as the city of Ank'harel was becoming the jewel of the desert, Thordak struck. A battle, however, that it was unable to win. Sent away, mortally wounded, it was thought that the dragon had died soon after, having not been seen for many centuries since. That is, until about 15 years ago. The rumors of a powerful drake, storming the beaches and seas, had been whispered for a long time, while ships would be lost at sea. It had survived and secretly ruled the island of Viscan in the south of the Lucidian Ocean. I suppose after generations, the dragon, now self-crowned as the Cinder King, grew greedier with the island's limited resources and began razing the Mournset countryside south of the Verdant Expanse and the Stormcrest Mountains.” And her eyes get even more distant as she is recalling all this. Reports of a dragon more massive than the records can compare hit Tal'Dorei. At the time, I wasn't part of the council. I traveled with a group of adventurers much like yourselves: Kima, Drake here, and a handful of other brave souls who are no longer with us. We traveled to investigate, but arrived to find this creature destroying everything surrounding the Glade Pools. Port Udall, gone, Byroden a smoldering ruin, and we gathered a small army of mercenaries and hunted it back to its new den in the Stormcrest, where a large number of lizardfolk had formed around him. But we were overpowered by the sheer might of the dragon. Many lives were lost. Knowing that we could not kill it, we turned to other means. I called upon the Arcana Pansophical, a circle of friends, arcane practitioners that agreed to work together across the land to keep them safe. They devised a trap, one that could, we believed, permanently seal Thordak within the elemental plane of fire, preventing him from ever returning to our world. At the sacrifice of many, including our companions Sirus, Dohla, Ghenn, we succeeded.” And as the tears begin to roll down her face, she looks around. “For naught now, it seems, and somehow he has broken our invocation. We bound his essence to the fountains of creation and thought he would stay there forever.” And she goes quiet and looks around for a second. “I'm sorry.”

TALIESIN: This couldn't be because of our journey to the elemental plane, could it?

MATT: “I'm so sorry.”

TALIESIN: We saw him there.

MARISHA: We did, but it sounds like he has been….

TALIESIN: We didn't set him free, you don't think?

TRAVIS: No, it was Keyleth's Ashari thing.

MARISHA: My people– Our job is to guard these realms.

TALIESIN: Is there any way of contacting the Fire Ashari?

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, oh god. Oh god, what if they're– what if they're dead?

MATT: “To bind him, we created an artifact called a soul anchor. It was crafted from the salvaged heart crystal of a primordial fire titan. The anchor could not be removed from the plane, and the Cinder King could not leave without it. I don't know how he's managed to escaped the binding of this.”

MARISHA: Oh my god, this is all my fault.

TALIESIN: No. No. This was a land mine waiting to be stepped on.

MARISHA: But wait. We fought– We fought my elders, we fought the Headmaster.

LAURA: It couldn't have been.

MATT: “That would have no bearing on this. The heart crystal is immense. 15, 20 feet in diameter, it's a gem of pure crystallized ruby and elemental power and energy. Lest you managed to find this and destroy it, which, I mean no offense, is far beyond your capability.”

MARISHA: My people, would they be okay?

MATT: “Depends on where he made his way through. The timing is rather conspicuous, seeing as how Winter's Crest recently passed, in which time the planes are the thinnest barricades.”

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: “Whatever it is, I fear that our ruse will not work twice, especially if Thordak has had all this time to obsess over his failure. I do not know our next course of action.”

MARISHA: What do you know of General Krieg?

MATT: “He's been gone for some time.”

MARISHA: You were on the council with him, do you know anything further?

MATT: “I think it was discussed that he had been killed during the demonic intrusion in the city, or deserted.”

LAURA: Would a dragon seek vengeance against one of their brethren killed?

MATT: “Chromatics are selfish beings, they do not care for each other, and the power of one is enough, but a conclave of dragons is both extraordinary and horrifying, but there is no– There is no sense of vengeance for their kin unless it is against the greater plan. Now, if what you say is true and these other dragons are bound together in the service of Thordak, I imagine they would be the ones who had the power and the resources to find some way to bring him through.”

LAURA: All right.

MATT: At which point, the dwarf steps up and still has his hand rubbing Allura's shoulder and says, WWe knew not what we were doing, other than trying to save it, don't blame yourself.”

MARISHA: Allura.

MATT: “Yes.”

MARISHA: Would you consider us guardians of this city?

MATT: “One of many. I believe the guardians–”

MARISHA: Is this because of us?

MATT: Allura looks at you dead-on and says, “The only guardians that Thordak would know of would be the ones that sent him away to that plane 15 years ago. This is my fault.”

LIAM: That's not true. If we are to solve this situation we cannot hide the truth. I killed Krieg. We killed Krieg. I finished Krieg.

LAURA: Krieg was a dragon, Allura.

MARISHA: A blue dragon.

LIAM: We stumbled upon his lair, reached through his home in Emon, through magical means. We found his lair.

LAURA: He attacked us.

LIAM: And we– I–

MARISHA: I reach out and I grab Vax's hand.

TALIESIN: We survived.

LIAM: When it happened, he had four stones, four orbs in his lair. They saw us.

MARISHA: They spoke out to us.

TALIESIN: They threatened us.

MATT: “When was this? Was this–”

TALIESIN: Many years ago.

MARISHA: Maybe two years ago.

LIAM: Not all that long ago.

LAURA: It was right after we got to Emon.

MATT: “It's been over a year at least. Well, if it's taken them that long at least to free Thordak, it means that this was probably in the works for quite some time. If we do share this responsibility, I assure you it weighs heavier on me than it does you. But right now we need all the allies we can gather. Now, you say Thordak is where right now?”

TRAVIS: Sitting on Emon.

MATT: “Within the city?”

LAURA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Vex, you would know.

LAURA: Oh, I can sense them. Right.

MATT: It's for a six-mile radius, was it?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: On the edge of your senses, you close your eyes and focus and extend your ability to feel the landscape around you. Indeed, The Cinder King still sits in the center of the city.

LAURA: He's here.

MATT: “What of the others?”

LAURA: Do I sense any others?

MATT: Nope.

LAURA: They're gone for the time being.

TRAVIS: It's weird, they do what he says.

TALIESIN: Barely.

LIAM: And on top of all that, we have this fucking skull.

MARISHA: I need to check in with my people. I need to check in with the Air Ashari.

MATT: “Where's the rest? Where's the council? Who do we know survived?”

LAURA: We don't know anything. Everyone was dying around us, we made it to the keep.

TRAVIS: It happened very quickly.

LIAM: We don't know what happened to Uriel, we didn't see.

MATT: “We need to take stock of who we can consider friends that are still around. We need all allies right now. That should be our first order of business, if anything.” And her face drops again. “I just lost my connection with Westruun.”

TRAVIS: Oh fuck. The whole world.

MARISHA: Yeah, this is an annihilation.

MATT: “This isn't an annihilation, if this was an extermination there wouldn't be any survivors, you wouldn't be here. The fact that they've only taken what they can of the city– what use is a city to a dragon if it doesn't have worshippers? They're vain beings.”

MARISHA: Think, Allura, what do all these cities have in common? And what would be the benefits of taking over these cities?

MATT: “Resources, their gold, their people.”

MARISHA: Do you think they just want domination over people? Over us? They called us ants!

MATT: “Yes.”

LAURA: They want to be gods.

MATT: “What good is a creature that sees itself as superior if there aren't those around it to tell them as such and confirm the belief, and if anyone refuses to bend to their will through fear and power. That is the nature of the chromatic dragons.”

MARISHA: There has to be something more that they want.

MATT: “Perhaps, but for now, the fact that he's even shouted mercy at this time as opposed to completely destroying everything in his wake, means that vanity can be used to our advantage. I don't know how soon, but that's something. Now–”

TRAVIS: Allies. Vasselheim has warriors, armories.

TALIESIN: Whitestone as well.

LAURA: We can bring them here.

MARISHA: I need to reach out to the Ashari and see if they're– I leave, I want to go– Well, actually; Allura, will you help me in a scrying spell?

MATT: “Yes, yes, the best I can, yes.”

MARISHA: I want to scry and first check in on the Fire Ashari.

MATT: Okay. All right, at this point she pulls out her crystal ball from a little tiny satchel, which is in itself a smaller Bag of Holding. Pulls out a small mirror, takes some water and pours it on the mirror, places the sphere above it, and it floats for a second. And there's a makeshift scrying ritual site here before you. You guys take about ten minutes to concentrate, and if you guys want to do anything in that ten-minute period, you're welcome to, or if you just want to watch and wait, you can.

TALIESIN: I'm going to just sit, it's been a long, long day.

MATT: Okay. The spell completes.

TRAVIS: Can I roll hit dice?

MATT: Yeah, you guys can begin to take a short rest, if you want to heal up.

LIAM: I go over to my sister in that time. I want– I want to kill that dragon. Or I want to die trying.

LAURA: We will.

MARISHA: Do I see Cerkonos?

MATT: So you take Allura's hand and you put your focus into the crystal sphere, your vision lifts out of the keep with extreme speed. You find your visual surroundings thrust across the Ozmit Sea. You find yourself swooping across the shores of Othanzia, over the forests, eventually coming upon the blackened clouds that perpetually hang above the charred mountain range that contains the home of the Fire Ashari and the entrance to the elemental plane of fire. Your vision crests the mountain and steps into the valley of broken, blackened shale to the ever-burning forest. As you come upon it, you recall where the Fire Ashari village was and where you were greeted before and given your trials. Where there is now nothing but sundered, broken wood, tents, destroyed bodies burned and charred and curled up in horrible ever-gasping pain. The forest itself is flattened from the inside out, like a blast from the center of it just exploded outward, the trees all bent and snapped at the base, and in the center, where there once was that small pool of molten lava that you created the portal through and stepped into the elemental plane, there is a large, ominous, flickering gash between the planes that is roughly 30 to 40 feet in width and height that is pulsing as fire and magma pours out of it. You can see wandering imps and elementals and various entities slowly peeking out and escaping and wandering throughout the mountain tops. From what you can see, there are no signs of any survivors.

MARISHA: It destroyed everything. They killed everyone.

MATT: Allura at this point, who pulls out of the ritual, reaches out and grabs you by the shoulders.

MARISHA: We failed.

MATT: And she looks you in the eyes, and for a moment you feel like her normally warm and embracing face has gone cold and intense and her voice seems to echo with an undercurrent of arcane focus and volume. She goes–

MARISHA: My people failed, we failed our cause.

MATT: “Keyleth, you failed no one, this is not your doing. This burden is ours as a people to hold, do not let this wash over you or he wins. This is their making, this is not yours. These creatures are evil incarnate, and it is our job, our true calling to end what they have done. Do not let this crush you, you are stronger than that. Pull yourself together. Your people, those that remain, they stand behind you.”

MARISHA: I'm not as strong as you, Allura.

MATT: “But you can be and you will be. Do you trust me? Do you trust me?”

MARISHA: Yes.

MATT: “Good.” Her grasp releases.

MARISHA: That's my people.

MATT: “And mine, and all of ours. There are many secrets in these lands. I'm a firm believer that there's always a way to victory, if we are smart about it and if we're quick about it. Now, I think we should look for survivors. Gather those we know that can rally to our cause, in Emon and beyond. What say you?”

TALIESIN: Aye.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MARISHA: Aye.

LIAM: We are to stand now or we might as well be dead.

LAURA: So we're definitely not going to wish on this skull then, yeah?

MATT: “I would recommend against it.”

MARISHA: Yeah, I stand.

MATT: “Very well, let us prepare for the fall of the Chroma Conclave. Together.” And that's where we'll end our session for tonight.

LAURA: Fucking A!

MATT: Hey guys, D&D's fun!

(laughter)

MARISHA: D&D will never be fun again; everything's ruined.

LIAM: Hey, we're all cows!

(laughter)

MARISHA: Back when things were so much simpler.

LIAM: Be sure to buy a t-shirt over on geekandsundry.com.

TRAVIS: Wow.

LIAM: In Sam's honor.

LAURA: What in the hell.

TALIESIN: Brought to you by Wyrmwood Gaming. Specifically designed to absorb tears.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Ah yes, thank you. It's so porous.

MATT: So yeah.

ASHLEY: Can we play longer?

TRAVIS: Can we play longer?

MATT: Aww.

MARISHA: What time is it? It's ten o'clock, and we ended on time and–

LAURA: That's the first time we've ever ended on time.

LIAM: Wow, that game felt like 20 hours.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Originally this was supposed to be a three-hour show, but it never quite made it that way.

MATT: I know we tried, we try and mostly fail, but occasionally we get it right. So, I mean, I'd say I'm sorry for the emotional rollercoaster, but no.

TRAVIS: The was fucking awesome.That was awesome, aside from the death.

TALIESIN: I would have kicked your ass, by the way, just throwing that out there. I picked up the poker because I didn't want to hurt you.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: All right, okay.

TALIESIN: Throwing that out there.

LIAM: My plan was to take that skull and run like a fucking football player and fucking go for the goal.

TALIESIN: Flash Gordon.

LIAM: Yeah. I would have been in the heart of Emon. Shoving it up the red dragon's nose.

MATT: Well. Welcome to the new story arc.

LAURA: Oh jeez.

(cheering)

LAURA: Everything changed.

MATT: Yeah. Oh man.

LAURA: Everything.

TALIESIN: When do I level up?

MARISHA: I'm going to find a corner to rock back and forth in.

LIAM: We would have been working in a lich's sugar mine if you'd done that.

TRAVIS: Nah, we all would have been kings and queens, we would be drinking iced mochas.

MARISHA: I was more afraid of us wishing ourselves out of existence. I wish there were no more dragons… and no more people and no more–

TALIESIN: It was such a bad deal, I said no. Like, can you imagine how bad of a deal that must have been?

LIAM: That's a good point.

TALIESIN: I was really looking for a reason to say yes.

MARISHA: And it turns out that it was just a fucking lame-ass pirate. Fuck that, we don't want to be indebted to some shithead pirate.

TALIESIN: Nothing good happens when you let Mxyzptlk out of the goddamn skull.

MATT: It was fun. I set a time for myself when she's gonna arrive, and I was like, “Oh man, what's going to happen before she gets there?” I was like, as you guys kept delaying it, they might actually– she might actually catch them in time.

MARISHA: She would have walked in and we're beating the shit out of each other.

LAURA: It all would have gone to hell if–

MATT: You don't know what would happen. You don't know.

TRAVIS: I would have saved the world, that's what would have happened. Fucking one.

MATT: None of you have heard of a githyanki in your travels.

TRAVIS: I would have been King Grog, I would have gotten a cave, I would had a bunch of harem people taking care of me, giving me sponge baths with their tongues.

LIAM: I was going to carve my name in your nuts.

TRAVIS: I would object to that.

TALIESIN: I was going to gender swap, I wanted– Percy was going to become Percina.

(laughter)

MARISHA: I wish I was a woman.

MARISHA: We still have the dragon problem, but now have the dragon and a pirate.

MATT: There you go– the de Rolo sisters– Glad you could make it, Ashley.

(cheering)

MATT: You should make it every week.

MARISHA: Does this mean I'm the last druid to make the Aramente?

MATT: You don't know.

TALIESIN: There might have been one after you.

LAURA: There's got to be other ones.

MATT: From what you saw, the Fire Ashari were decimated, you saw a number of bodies, you don't know if any escaped, you don't if any were hidden, you don't know what happened. At that location, it is desolation, and you get the sense from that, that is precisely the place where Thordak came through the plane.

MARISHA: I'm wondering about the other locations, though, too.

TALIESIN: I want to know about Whitestone. We have a lot a phone calls to make.

MARISHA: We have a lot of phone calls. Like I–

TRAVIS: They're all dead, everybody's dead.

MARISHA: Theoretically wiped my people off the face of the planet.

MATT: Such an optimist.

MARISHA: If they all busted through–

TALIESIN: Does decimate mean that 1/10 survived? Or that only 10% died? I can never remember which one decimated is. I know it's one of the two.

MATT: Yeah, that term has been largely misused in the current-day vernacular.

TALIESIN: I know. 10% died, that's what it is.

TRAVIS: I love misusing vernacular.

MATT: It's fun. You guys–

TRAVIS: Great fucking story Matt, holy shit. Holy shit, you had trees and stuff.

TALIESIN: Why do you got to be a dick, man?

MATT: As we're discovering the white battlemats don't pick up as well on the camera as the colors, I'm trying to use other options whenever possible.

TRAVIS: It works. The green was amazing.

LAURA: It was really cool with green.

MATT: So I'm going to try and push more on that. A little more work on my end, but it'll be fine.

LIAM: Tell me more, sadist.

LAURA: Thanks for joining us, you guys.

MATT: You guys, thank you for watching, and hope you have a wonderful night, and we'll see you guys next Thursday. Good night!

MARISHA: I need a cigarette, and I don't smoke. 

Part I

MATT: So, to get us up to speed. Vox Machina, the intrepid band of adventurers, who have been enjoying being honorary members of the council of Tal'Dorei, returning from a harsh adventure in Whitestone, having the Winter's Crest festival, and then going in and re-inspecting the death place of a blue dragon they once fought over a year ago, returned just in time for a series of chromatic dragons, white, black, red, and green, all attacking Emon at once. This union of extremely powerful dragons tore through the city, with the red staying behind, named Thordak, the Cinder King, basically housing himself in Emon and claiming himself essentially ruler of that area. The party fled to their keep, attempted to help a bunch of refugees inside and then were immediately attacked by Vorugal, the white dragon. A heavy battle commenced that was ill in favor of your victory until Thordak himself knocked Vorugal out of the sky, claiming that there were better things to be done. So three of the four of this Chroma Conclave have now gone east, while Thordak sits in the middle of his new nesting place. You guys decided to try and help those who were in the keep at the time, those who survived that encounter on the outside of Greyskull. However, Percy and Grog had a conversation about this magical skull artifact they had acquired: this whispering in exchange for a wish if it got freed. This led to a rather intense bit of conflict–

TRAVIS: Negotiation?

MATT: Yes. (laughs) Which, thanks to the luck of the die, seemed to avoid a unique circumstance, whatever that might have been.

TRAVIS: Bullshit.

MATT: (laughs) However, the party in this tense scenario were then visited by a dwarven elementalist named Drake, along with your old-time friend and guide Allura Vysoren, who had sensed the connection to her teleportation circles here in Emon severed immediately. There was discussion about how this came about, who's to blame, and it appears that this dragon has a history, 15 years before, of having conflict with Allura and her then-party of adventurers, many of whom lost their life in the final battle. When they realized they were unable to actually defeat Thordak, hatched a plan to seal him within the elemental plane of fire, and had managed to keep him there for 15 years until recently. We left off with Allura suddenly sensing her connection to the Westruun sigil severed as well.

LAURA: God, I forgot about that!

TRAVIS: Nothing like genocide to put you in the mood!

MATT: Yeah! That is where we'll pick up. So, at this point, after Allura senses this, her eyes go wide for a moment and she– you, being there in front of her still, Keyleth, after your guys' scrying ritual, grabs your shoulder, and looks around the room. “Who is left? Where is the council? Which allies can we draw to us, in hopes of planning our next move?”

MARISHA: We don't know.

TRAVIS: We are scattered.

LAURA: For all we know, the council is lost.

MARISHA: We could be all that's left.

MATT: (sighs) “Well, we have to try and gather what information we can about who remains. If anyone out there survives, any of our allies, we need to make sure that they're brought away from the center of this chaos. And hopefully we can reconvene and figure out a path of hoping to free our city, our entire land, of this scourge.”

LAURA: How do we even make contact with them? Thordak is in the center of town.

MATT: “Perhaps skirting the center and hoping others have found their way towards the outskirts of it. I don't know. This is as far as I've gotten to the city, is your guys' keep. You have the better position on this. Where would anyone in the town go? Are there places to hide, are there–”

LIAM: I think that they would leave the center of the city, at least to the edges, if not try to get out, though that might be foolish.

TALIESIN: Check the harbor, maybe?

LAURA: We know that Riskel made secret passageways in different places.

TRAVIS: Security tunnels!

LAURA: Yeah. Did we ever find out if he put one in ours? Did we have one? That leads into the town?

TALIESIN: We don't know.

SAM: Oh, didn't we have a tunnel made that goes under the wall?

MATT: You did, actually.

MARISHA: But does it lead out into the city?

MATT: You haven't actually utilized it yet.

LIAM: We've never used it, but they described it to us when they brought us here the first day.

LAURA: Maybe we can sneak in!

SAM: To the city.

LAURA: Well, yeah!

LIAM: We need to see if Uriel is still alive.

SAM: By the way, hi guys.

LAURA: Hi, how's it going?

TRAVIS: Wait, who was with Gilmore?

LAURA: Gilmore disappeared. I didn't see where he went.

LIAM: He was alone before it all happened.

TALIESIN: Well, that's another place to check.

MARISHA: What, where? Gilmore's?

TALIESIN: I'm thinking of where I would go if I didn't know what to do–

LIAM: That's smart.

LAURA: What places are left that have a teleportation circle?

SAM: What about the thieves' guild tunnels? Would anyone go there?

MARISHA: It depends on who knows! It's a way out of the city once again.

LAURA: The smuggler's coves, all of them.

TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea, either.

MARISHA: That was all through the–

SAM: That bar.

MARISHA: Through the bar, in the–

SAM: Place. With the thing.

LAURA: That one!

MATT: “The connections I had to this town were within my tower, your keep, and the Lyceum, the Alabaster Lyceum. The Lyceum has also been severed, and though I know not of what may remain there, that is also a place of great power, hence why it was probably a very operative target for their attack.”

MARISHA: Allura.

MATT: “Yes?”

MARISHA: How far does your arcane connection reach? Can you feel when you lose connection to other cities?

MATT: “If I have a connection to the sigil, yes. I don't have much beyond the boundaries of Tal'Dorei. Vasselheim does not allow sigils for transportation, it's against their philosophy against embedded arcane intrusion. If Westruun is under attack as well, I will make my way there in hopes of salvaging any lives that I can.”

MARISHA: You're leaving?

LAURA: If Westruun is under attack, now, and we know Thordak is here, does that mean–?

TRAVIS: His forces are divided.

MARISHA: This is a takeover. For some reason Thordak doesn't want to leave this city. Why?

SAM: This is the seat of power, right?

LAURA: We could potentially attack one of his subordinates, though. One of the other dragons in Westruun, by themselves!

SAM: But then he could just come and kill us!

LAURA: Well, then we teleport right back out.

SAM: Okay?

LAURA: Bad idea? Bad idea?

SAM: How fast is he?

MARISHA: Well, they just made it to Westruun, several hundred miles away, in all of 40 minutes?

TALIESIN: There's a lot of assumptions here.

MATT: “They move rather fast, and to be honest, I hate to inform you, but my single teleportation ability has been utilized for the day in getting here.”

LAURA: Oh.

MARISHA: I'm tapped out, too.

TRAVIS: Me too.

LIAM: Lady Allura, what do you know of Marquet?

MATT: “Marquet.”

LIAM: You said that they successfully repulsed him.

MATT: “400 years ago, yes, when he was younger. He was a much smaller dragon then.”

LIAM: Oh.

TRAVIS: 400 years ago?

LAURA: Yeah, he is ancient, Grog! He is ancient!

TRAVIS: Yeah, slightly.

MATT: “The only thing I can think of: there are two bastions of knowledge that hold inklings as to what could be the undoing of dragonkind, of powerful entities. There were battles of many such powerful entities, long, long ago, back before the Penance, before the historical wiping of civilization. Some of these books remain in Vasselheim, being the only city to have survived those times. A few have found their way in the Cobalt Reserve, the library of Westruun. If I could go and hope that this library still stands, stay out of sight, help who I can along the way, and gather what bits of research I can and bring them back here, perhaps we could reconvene as long as you go and find who you can of our allies that survive within Emon.”

LAURA: We can do that!

TRAVIS: Within Emon.

LAURA: Yes.

SAM: Going to let you go on your own?

LIAM: Well, she has Drake with her.

MATT: Which Drake next to her says, “Damn right, she does! And I don't mean any offense, but the two of us is about the same as you lot!”

TRAVIS: Say what?

MATT: “Trust me,” and he gives you this dwarven grin as both of his eyes spark for a second with electricity.

TRAVIS: (quietly) Well, fuck.

MATT: She pushes him aside and goes, “It's all right, Drake. For our mission, it's going to require more– success is guided on being subtle. Some of you excel at that, maybe not all. And speed. I believe we can handle this. You're better suited in combing large bits of territory and seeking the allies that may survive.”

LAURA: Will you be leaving in the morning, then? Can you go tonight?

MATT: “I should leave now.”

MARISHA: You're going to go on foot?

MATT: “We have other means of transportation.”

MARISHA: Allura, if you're going to Westruun, and what you say is true, that we have two potential options for finding out how to defeat these dragons, should we be heading to Vasselheim? Maybe that's best where we're needed right now.

MATT: “If Vasselheim still stands, I– knowing its history, that is one of the most fortified cities, the most fortified city in our civilization. It's endured two great wars, and has been the starting point of each cycle. I doubt even with the might that these dragons hold, they would have the gall, the foolish intent, to attack such a place. Especially the center of an entity such as Bahamut, who stands against such creatures. I think Vasselheim is going to definitely claim a key role in this attempt to save ourselves.”

LAURA: Bahamut is a good guy?

MARISHA: Yeah, for the most– yeah, yeah.

LAURA: Cool.

MARISHA: It's the city that was closest to Pyrah.

MATT: “Yes.”

MARISHA: My people, my tribe. We could pull double duty, we could go and I can–

TRAVIS: Heh. Doody.

MARISHA: Grog! Now is not the time!

TALIESIN: What of Whitestone? Was there any mention, any–?

MATT: “I have no connection to Whitestone. I did not have time arriving there to install a sigil.”

TALIESIN: Did you learn anything of the anomaly beneath the castle that might be useful?

MATT: She shakes herself in her current mindset and goes, “Well, me and Drake here, we spent the better part of two days studying the structure underneath the city. It itself appears to be at least 600 years old, predating Whitestone's construction. Unfortunately, both of our magics are thwarted in the proximity of this structure and any rituals that we attempted, or would have been able to attempt, to discern its nature, in the classic means, would not be functional due to its anti-magical properties. However, we've taken a few things of note, and we're taking our observations to reach for two research facilities around the world, one of which I intended to be the Cobalt Reserve before this happened.”

TALIESIN: Interesting, thank you.

LAURA: So there was no– you didn't move it, you didn't do anything with it, it's still just sitting there.

MARISHA: It's a hazard zone right now?

MATT: “Essentially. We have locked it off and it's under intense guard. We spent a little bit of time experimenting with its properties, and any object of firm matter that was introduced to this object was then torn from our grasp, sundered into many pieces, and then vanished.”

MARISHA: Yeah.

LAURA: Maybe we can get Thordak near the little orb!

SAM: Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

LAURA: I like it.

TALIESIN: That was definitely what I was thinking.

SAM: How do we do that?

TALIESIN: Well, it's part of a plan.

TRAVIS: Hey, big dragon, there's a snack over here. Take a bite!

SAM: We could leave a trail of gold that leads to it, Goldilocks-style.

MARISHA: That thing was also several hundred feet below ground. How are we going to get that dragon down there?

LIAM: Does Thordak have any offspring?

MATT: “Not that I know of.”

LAURA: Not anymore.

TALIESIN: The thought would be to actually remove it from the chamber, maybe.

LAURA: That could be really, really terrible.

TRAVIS: Do dragons have families? Do they have, like, wives and loved ones?

LAURA: They have children.

MATT: “Chromatics especially, from what I understand in my research, they do mate, but there is no family structure, there is no love between brethren, other than the continued existence of that bloodline. If a child of a dragon is slaughtered and one does find out, depending on if it's their only brethren, it could incite a sense of vengeance, depending on the color. But I know of no immediate children to Thordak. I have no knowledge of the other dragons which have attacked this day.”

TRAVIS: We should ask him.

LAURA: (laughs) We need to do as much research as we can.

MATT: “I have not seen Thordak myself in 15 years, and I know not the state of which he is in, or what power he has now gained. Whatever information you can gather safely, right now, is going to guide us down the rest of this path in attempting to take this terrible creature down.”

SAM: If we go back into the city to try to find council members, and we succeed, what does that get us? A bunch of people who also don't know how to defeat the dragon.

LAURA: Right, but they're powerful people! They could help us.

SAM: Politically?

TALIESIN: Both, actually.

LAURA: Experience and warrior-wise.

TRAVIS: What about a spy? Dragons want servitude, right?

MATT: “They, especially the reds, see themselves as superior to all beings, and will bend, and have in the past bent, small townships and civilizations to their whims and worship, yes. Which is, based on what you're telling me, is part of what Thordak is attempting with this city now.”

TRAVIS: So, what if we send a shady piece of shit to go bend the knee and walk on the inside?

SAM: Listen, Jarett is good, but I don't want to sacrifice him like that!

LAURA: What about you, Scanlan? You're so good at lying, and–

MARISHA: Being shady!

LAURA: And sucking up, and grovelling–

SAM: What about Trinket?

LAURA: Trinket can't talk!

SAM: Oh, that's right!

MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

LIAM: And I do have this– pulling the brooch off– this would mask your true nature, somewhat.

TRAVIS: It's true! (gasps)

SAM: (stuttering) I am not going to go–

TRAVIS: Ancient, giant, red, fuck-off dragon!

SAM: They have mind control powers! They have influence! They have charisma! Beyond even mine!

TRAVIS: You'll be his bitch! You'll trim his toenails, you'll get real buddy-buddy–

SAM: I'm the size of his toenails!

LAURA: Slave Leia outfit, with a chain around your neck!

LIAM: No, he's the little guy next to Jabba! (cackling laughter)

MARISHA: You might be surprised. You might like it!

TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean like what, dragons have to eat right? Dragons eat?

LAURA: Dragons eat.

TRAVIS: Yeah! So you poison a cow, and then you're like, Oh Lord Thioredoxin, here you go! Poison cow, you're dead, hero of the city!

SAM: Something tells me I would end up his gimp.

TRAVIS: (stuttering) You Dimension Door! You're super quick! It's a no brainer!

SAM: All right, that's the best plan ever.

LAURA: Let's just think about it, all right, Scanlan?

LIAM: We need to find Uriel. We need to go in– all these are the next step– we need to see– we have sacrificed a lot to save Uriel before, we're not just going to leave him in the city! We need to find the tunnel under this keep, go in there, see who's left, and get them out!

MARISHA: You know, speaking of spies, does anyone else feel like this is fairly convenient timing? Someone in that council had to have known this was happening. Wouldn't you? All of the Cloudtop District was in one place!

LIAM: That's not a bad point.

MARISHA: Someone knew! It was the perfect opportunity to strike! They took out the entire upper echelon of the city in one strike! They waited for them all to be in one place.

LAURA: General Krieg was here for a while, before we discovered him. He had friends.

TALIESIN: But he wouldn't have known this was coming, though.

LAURA: No, but he was one of them.

LIAM: It's possible they might not have been working in conjunction with each other. They could have been on their own, all of them, or all together, I don't know.

TALIESIN: It does open the door to some definite possibilities.

MARISHA: The timing was perfect. That's all I'm saying.

TALIESIN: The timing was perfect.

TRAVIS: You know the best way to flush out something like that? If someone was a spy.

(laughter)

SAM: All right, I'll do it, I'll go and–

MARISHA: What if we go and find a shady individual, like he was saying. What if we don't send in Scanlan. What if we find someone?

SAM: That person will surely die.

(laughter)

MARISHA: You're probably right.

TRAVIS: Will surely die. Which I'm all right with.

TALIESIN: Let's go find this tunnel that we paid for.

LAURA: We need to see– get in the city and find some people. Allura, you be safe–

MATT: “I will.”

LAURA: – and silent and swift, and you get back here as quickly as possible.

TALIESIN: What time is it? When was the last time we actually took a nap?

MATT: Oh, it's been quite a while, you guys have been running since before the meeting in the Cloudtop District.

MARISHA: Which happened at nighttime, remember.

MATT: It happened at dusk.

LAURA: It's already morning the next day?

MATT: No, no, it's evening now for you guys.

MARISHA: What time approximately? After midnight?

MATT: I'd say it's after midnight, 1AM.

LAURA: Ah, fudge.

TRAVIS: Hot fudge?

MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little tulip and hand it to Allura.

MATT: She takes it, nods, places it in one of the–

MARISHA: In case we need to be in contact.

LIAM: Well, if we go now, we have the benefit of darkness in the city.

SAM: Hang on, we're going to go now, without resting?

LIAM: I'm not saying that, I'm weighing our options. If we go now, we can go under the cover of night, but we're going to be exhausted.

TALIESIN: And dragons don't care about night. They can see perfectly fine.

MARISHA: Yes, we've learned that much.

LIAM: Well, let's lie down and take a nap.

LAURA: Take a nap.

MARISHA: What time– Wait, hang on.

LAURA: Sleep as little as possible that will actually get us rested.

MATT: A short rest or a long rest?

LAURA: Long rest.

MATT: Long rest is eight hours.

LAURA: Should we sleep and get up in the morning and hit it?

TALIESIN: It'll at least give everybody time to go to ground.

LAURA: That's true. I mean, can I sense Thordak and figure out, I mean, is he just settling in that one spot? Is there anything else around or is it just him in the center, being a dick, and no other movement of other things?

MATT: You took a while earlier to concentrate and you focus on that point again. Thordak is this giant oppressive force of dragon kin in the center of the city, seemingly not moving.

LIAM: And last week, you said that Vex couldn't sense the other three.

MATT: Correct.

LAURA: They went to hit the other cities, obviously.

MARISHA: I still have one 5th-level spell left. I can Commune with Nature and try and find out if a few people are still left in the city before we go to sleep.

LIAM: Might as well.

MARISHA: If we're not going out.

LAURA: What?

MARISHA: I can Commune with Nature and try to find certain people.

LAURA: Should we? Yeah.

MARISHA: All right. I go out to Pike and the Sarenrae temple.

MATT: Okay, so as you go the temple, you can see the surviving 25 people that are all lumped in. They're calmer right now, but you can see a lot of them are still consoling each other and talking and as soon as you walk in they're like– a couple of them step up immediately like, “What's going on, is everything all right?” “I'm sorry. Mom, I'm sorry” They start crying and, “Shh! It's okay, it's okay. Is everything all right? Are we safe here? Is this okay?”

MARISHA: You will be all right. Everyone calm down. We've had a rough day and it's been hard on everyone but you should be safe here for the evening. Hopefully. Everyone–

TRAVIS: Do better.

MARISHA: Look, I'm not– I'm trying on this whole leadership thing, okay?

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

MARISHA: Ugh.

TALIESIN: Ouch, I didn't know it went that low. I'm sorry.

MARISHA: Eight.

MATT: Surprisingly, I rolled a one. First roll of the night.

MARISHA: Any little bit of hope works.

MATT: Yeah, apparently. So the one man who stood up, and the younger child to him, looks around and he tells her, “Shh! Go lay down. Very well, thank you again. We're sorry for–” Everyone else in the room nods in agreement and you see they're dirt- and tear-stained and all just happy to not be on fire right now or frozen.

TRAVIS: Are there any injuries in the room that we haven't attended to?

MATT: There have been a few injuries. However, Pike has already taken time with Keyleth to see to them, when they first arrived.

LAURA: Hey Matt, I was helping, too, mother–

MATT: You were helping until you were pulled away for the five minutes.

TRAVIS: Good job, Pike. And you too, Vex.

ASHLEY: Yeah, you know, got to help the group.

MATT: All right, so, as you guys are having this conversation, Allura and Drake walk their way out to the courtyard and she looks back at the rest of you and goes, “Stay safe, and if anything happens, find a way to let me know. I will return as soon as I can with what I can find. Possibly who I can find.”

LAURA: Wait!

MARISHA: Secrets!

TRAVIS: Don't forget to visit Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

SAM: That's not a real place, Travis, it doesn't exist.

TRAVIS: Who's Travis? I can't just hop in and out of character.

SAM: Grog, who are you talking to?

TRAVIS: My sword.

MARISHA: Your sword. You're promoting Gilmore's to your sword.

MATT: So go ahead and roll for me.

LAURA: Okay.

TRAVIS: What?

LAURA: Whoa! 24.

MATT: Okay. All right. So as you and Allura embrace, she steps back and gives a nod and looks out to everybody.

MARISHA: I reach out and I grab her hand and say, thank you, truly, for everything.

MATT: “Don't thank me yet. Most of all of this lies on my shoulders.” And you can see she's holding it together the best she can, but there is a crippling guilt in her visual presence, based on everything that's happening here. You know that there's a mutual understanding that, while no one knows the true reason why all this is happening, everyone seems to have a stake as to why it happened and possibly may have been somewhat at fault. And as she nods, she looks at Drake and Drake gives her a nod and begins casting a spell. As his fingers twirl in the air, these blue sparks trail his fingertips as it draws this large spiral of electrical energy that holds itself in place. It bursts out and encompasses both their bodies and their forms all of a sudden shrink down and shutter into these two sparks of energy that then arc off, and you can see these two bolts of electricity now coasting through the sky, bouncing off roads, bouncing off rock, bouncing off a tree. They both are traveling via spark across the countryside.

LAURA: How the fuck do we get that ability?

MARISHA: I don't know, but I want it.

LAURA: She's so fucking cool. Do you think that was her or do you think that was Drake?

MATT: Drake cast it.

LAURA: Oh man, that's so cool!

SAM: Should we go to sleep?

MARISHA: Well, I'm doing my Commune with Nature spell. I drop down and mediate.

MATT: All righty.

SAM: If only I had taken a dump in the middle of town, I could see what's going on right now.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Hindsight is ten–

SAM: Other number.

(laughter)

MATT: Okay, three facts of your choice. As you sit in the temple quietly and connect yourself with the land and the foliage of the surrounding area of Emon, what are your questions?

MARISHA: Do I sense Gilmore's presence?

MATT: What's the radius on this, three miles?

MARISHA: A few miles.

MATT: You do sense a presence.

MARISHA: A presence.

MATT: A very weak presence.

LAURA: (gasp) Oh, no!

SAM: That could mean he's far away or that he's dead.

MARISHA: Can I focus in even harder and find where that presence is coming from more directly?

MATT: The direction that best you can ascertain is it's in the direction of Abdar's Promenade.

MARISHA: His shop?

MATT: That's where his shop is, yes.

SAM: Good to know.

MARISHA: Okay. Last question, do I sense Uriel?

MATT: Within your three-mile range, you do not.

LAURA: Maybe he–

TRAVIS: He got to moving.

SAM: Or he's dead.

LAURA: Okay, when you are sensing things, does that mean you would sense if they were alive or you wouldn't sense them at all if they were dead?

MATT: The questions were: are they in the city? Which direction are they? Those are essentially the answers that you get through the connection of nature.

LAURA: Okay, so they could be dead in the city and you'd still sense them?

MATT: That's possible.

MARISHA: I don't know. It's hard to say.

LIAM: He could have gone to the harbor. He could have fled through the tunnels we don't even know about.

LAURA: He could have a teleportation circle.

MARISHA: We should check his shop first.

TRAVIS: Yeah. If Uriel's farther away, it's–

MARISHA: Uriel, I don't know. Maybe he's dead, maybe he's gone, I don't know, I don't know.

TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a moot point.

MARISHA: How about this, let's find Gilmore, if he's alive or dead then that will answer a lot of questions, how's that?

LIAM: I agree.

TALIESIN: Yes.

LIAM: And if he did not make it, we still go to his shop.

SAM: Take everything.

LIAM: Use whatever's left. It's what Gilmore would want.

SAM: It's true.

TRAVIS: I agree.

LAURA: We go then, if it hasn't been ransacked already.

TRAVIS: Let's go find that magic fucker.

MARISHA: So we're going now? Tonight?

TALIESIN: Sleep and then go.

MARISHA: I don't know, maybe we should go.

LAURA: Should we stealth in and see what we can see? I don't know, I feel like we need to rest, y'all.

MARISHA: How bad are we?

LIAM: (laughing) I should probably rest.

ASHLEY: I'm at 25.

TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

LAURA: I'm pretty low and I'm almost out of dice.

TRAVIS: I can stay guard with the rest of everybody else, because I'm okay.

LIAM: They're expecting– Thordak is expecting to sit on us like a bunch of eggs in a basket. We're fine for the night, we go tomorrow.

LAURA: Potentially.

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: All right, you guys take a long rest?

TALIESIN: Quick question, where is the skull?

TRAVIS: You fucking– that was my question.

LAURA: I don't know, what are you talking about?

MATT: Who had the skull last?

TRAVIS: You expect me to remember those sort of things?

MARISHA: I remember.

TALIESIN: Either you have it or I have it. I don't remember.

MATT: The last person to hold it was Vex.

TALIESIN: Was Vex. Okay, excellent. I have a perfectly reasonable hiding place or, if you like, you can take it.

TRAVIS: Yeah, your ass.

LAURA: Yes, I think it's reasonably well-hidden at this moment.

TALIESIN: Excellent.

SAM: Where is it?

LAURA: I don't know.

MARISHA: Well-hidden.

TALIESIN: That will do.

MATT: All right. You guys find yourselves, as best as you can, resting for the evening. It is an evening of tossing and turning for a lot of you. Flashes of memories. Scanlan, you are plagued by the thought of your newly discovered daughter being not far outside the city when all this went down. Percy, you have flashes of the idea of Whitestone, recently saved and brought to freedom, being torn asunder by dragons not two weeks afterwards. You are plagued by visions of the Pyrah, the moment that Thordak must have torn through and the havoc that was wreaked afterward. Both of you can't help but think back to when you first returned to Byroden and seeing the smoldering ruin that you now know to be the work of the Cinder King 15 years before, and those words about wondering if that was the last thing your mother saw. Grog, you want that skull.

(laughter)

MATT: Pike, your thoughts go back to Vasselheim and the people there that you, out of necessity and need for friendship and to protect them, left behind, knowing that they would be safe, and now the uncertainty as to whether or not Vasselheim still stands and whether or not you left them to a fate you could have protected them. That guilt rides on you as well. You guys complete your long rest, you restore full hit points and you get back half of your max hit dice. You can only get back half, so if you spent more than half of your hit dice, you're still at– just so you guys are aware of that.

MARISHA: Wait, what? We only restore half each night?

MATT: Yes.

TALIESIN: Not half of what's missing, but–

MARISHA: Just half.

MATT: Yeah. So if you used eight of your hit dice, you are only going to get back, at level 12, six hit dice.

MARISHA: Good to know. I don't think I used any.

MATT: So, it is a gradual declining resource. Hasn't come up too much beforehand, but I want to make sure you guys were aware of that. Anyway, as you come to in the morning, you can smell– you're used to Laina cooking a very nice breakfast. You smell food being cooked, but it's much more basic for the masses. As you eventually groggily find your way downstairs, pardon the pun, you can see there is essentially a gruel pot and there is a soup line and food is being served best to their capabilities to the people that have taken refuge in Greyskull Keep. You are welcome to do as you please.

LAURA: We should head out.

TALIESIN: I'm ready.

SAM: We're just going to march into the city?

LAURA: We're going to march under the city.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to check out that tunnel first.

SAM: The tunnel just goes to the other side of the wall.

LIAM: We don't even know where the tunnel is. We need to find an entrance to said tunnel.

MATT: The tunnel, actually–

TRAVIS: And then– sorry, I was going to say and then when we get to the city, then we figure out what we do.

SAM: Grog, good thinking. (laughs)

TRAVIS: Leave it to me.

MATT: So, the tunnel has been installed to the back of the kitchen. There is a large pantry there and the tunnel is a trap door that is currently set by the very, very back of the pantry. Actually, not too dissimilar from the entrance to the Clasp in the Diamond Nest Inn. However, it's much smaller and is a small single-person tunnel. You have to go single-file and it's not very tall. Grog, you are going to have to almost crawl through at your height and everyone else would have to hunch down, except for you and Pike are fine. You guys are tiny enough. It's about a gnome-sized tunnel.

SAM: Nice.

MATT: And as you guys go into the pantry, Laina is like, “Oh, don't– I'm trying– where's everyone going?” and sees you all clown-car into the pantry.

LAURA: Before we left, I wanted to find Jarett really fast.

MATT: Okay, Jarett is currently outside of the keep in the main courtyard area, crossbow at the ready, keeping his eyes to the sky, mostly looking off in the direction of Emon.

LAURA: I walk up and I hand him a bag of 300 gold and I say, this is, far and away, so much more than we asked you to do when we hired you. And I appreciate everything you're doing. Take care of the keep. Use this money to take care of the people here.

MATT: He takes it and throws it in the air and catches it. “I appreciate that. I take great pride in my work and I assure you, I would sooner die than let this place fall.”

LAURA: Then I give him additional 100 gold.

SAM: What is going on?

MATT: As you pass him the 100 gold, he puts his hand up and actually pushes your hand away and says, “I appreciate the sentiment, but you've already done too much. You hired me for a reason. I'm doing my job, but your generosity is noted.”

SAM: Ah, he's so honorable!

TRAVIS: Is his hair blowing in the wind as he rejects that amount?

MATT: His hair is really short.

LAURA: I resist the urge to mug down with him and I walk away.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: What are you waiting for?

(laughter)

MATT: All right.

TRAVIS: Yeah, you might die. He might die.

LIAM: Yeah. Look at that big pouty bottom lip. Go get that.

(laughter)

MATT: Some of that Marquet–

(laughter)

MARISHA: Sexy, sexy exotic accent.

MATT: – and that Ank'Harel caramel skin. Jarett's a hottie.

LIAM: I just saw 100 pictures drawn in a instant.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: With a flair.

MARISHA: Wait, you hear that? It's pens hitting the paper. It's fanfiction right now.

MATT: So, as you guys make your way through the tunnel, and it's a long, very simple tunnel. The construction is solid. You don't feel as you walk through that any of it is in worry of collapse. There has been no sufficient seismic activity or impact above ground to warrant that directly above the tunnel. And you continue to trudge ahead and it's pitch black. Those of you with darkvision probably take the forefront.

TRAVIS: Is there a light vision? I'm on it.

MARISHA: I go ahead and light up a hand.

MATT: So, you guys, all of you have low-light, darkvision. You're fine and Percy is the only one who needs the aid in this. But as you continue forward for a good 25, 30 minutes or so, the tunnel comes to a small stop and there's a very simple rope ladder that leads upward.

LAURA: I put my hood up.

MATT: Who's going up first?

TRAVIS: Is there anything past that?

MATT: The ladder goes up and goes into a small wooden slat. It's not even a door. It's almost like a wood pallet.

LAURA: Get up there. See what you see.

TRAVIS: You sneaky dick.

LIAM: Okay, at the bottom of the ladder, because she's right behind me. You know, you never cease to impress me.

MATT: Okay, you go up. Roll a stealth check.

LIAM: 25.

MATT: All right, good to know. So, as you get up to the top, you feel the wooden slats on top and as you push, there's not any weight to them. They give way immediately, and as you push it aside, you can see you're inside a small wooden structure. It is enclosed and a little bit of the morning light is peeking through the space between the slats of wood. Looking about the general size and height, it appears to almost be an outhouse structure, but there is no actual outhouse here or, at least where there once was, has recently been converted to the exit of your tunnel.

LIAM: Smells like jerky.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Right there with you.

MATT: There is a door that leads out.

LIAM: Okay, I will crack it an inch and look through.

MATT: Okay. There is a chain on the outside of the door that keeps it shut with a big, thick lock at the bottom.

LIAM: Is there enough room to get my hand through to the other side?

MATT: I'd say, yes, with your experience and your lithe form, you manage to just eke it through and you can get your wrist past, but anything beyond–

LIAM: I'm double-jointed, Matt.

MATT: And with that double joint you get that close. So, yeah, you can reach it.

LIAM: All right, so, I can feel a lock there?

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: All right, I'm going to one-hand pick this lock.

MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll. This is a difficult maneuver, even with your experience. Given that you can't actually see the front of the lock, you're having to literally feel your way through it.

TRAVIS: Roll high, you pointy-eared bastard.

LAURA: Natural 20.

MARISHA: It's like unclasping a bra.

TALIESIN: How do you do that?

LIAM: That's 30.

MATT: (laughs) 30? With a single moment, you, actually feeling with one thumb, you're feeling the vibration of each tumbler on the inside of the lock and as each one progressively clicks, you eventually get to the fourth one before (tink) and it hangs open loosely, within a matter of 40 seconds. You wish other people would have seen that happen because that was pretty, pretty cool maneuver. But you know, at least.

LIAM: Come on up. It wasn't even locked.

ALL: Aw.

(laughter)

MATT: He's so modest. Oh no, we lost Ashley! We lost an Ashley.

LIAM: I've got it. I've got it.

MARISHA: Cleric down.

MATT: As you all climb back up–

LAURA: Stealth, stealth, stealth, everybody. I cast Pass Without a Trace.

MARISHA: Oh. She's going to call back. She said we turned into robots. She disconnected.

MATT: Okay, gotcha.

LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

MATT: Okay, good. So–

LAURA: Wait, wait! How's Trinket going to climb up this rope, y'all? Polymorph?

MARISHA: I do have Polymorph.

SAM: Oh no.

MARISHA: We need to make him tinier, anyway. What do you want him to be?

SAM: We should leave him.

LAURA: Shut up!

MATT: Which, for the record, Trinket going through this tunnel looks like the cleaner in Labyrinth. It fills the entire tunnel. He's like (bear noises) having to pull his way through.

LAURA: Okay, what if we polymorph him into a very small raccoon? But he's got hands, you know, so he can hold things?

LIAM: What about a wolverine or a badger?

MARISHA: I have a question.

SAM: Honey badger doesn't care.

LAURA: Honey badger don't give a shit. It just takes what it wants.

MARISHA: If I polymorph Trinket, can I then use Beast Sense to be able to see through him? Would that be able to work?

MATT: What does Beast Sense do?

MARISHA: Beast Sense lets me see through the eyes of a beast.

MATT: You can do that with Trinket regardless.

MARISHA: But does it stack with Polymorph? And if he is like polymorphed into– I mean, I guess he's still a beast.

MATT: If beast sense is a concentration, then no. You will lose one to do the other.

MARISHA: All right.

MATT: Yeah, and Beast Sense is concentration.

LAURA: Is Polymorph a concentration?

MATT: Yes, it is. So one or the other.

MARISHA: It's fine. But if I turned him into a bird, I can make him an aerial scout, is what I was thinking, like the wargs in Game of Thrones.

MATT: Or you can become one yourself. What are you doing?

MARISHA: I will make him a cute little sewer rat or like–

LAURA: No! He can hang on to me.

TRAVIS: Oh my god, make him something!

LAURA: Will he still get his armor?

MARISHA: Can I make him a lemur? (laughs)

MATT: You can.

LAURA: But lemurs are slow, dude. Raccoons are cool.

MARISHA: How about a red panda?

LAURA: Red panda!

MARISHA: I'm going to make him a red panda!

TALIESIN: Red panda. That's cool.

SAM: Wait, wait, wait, can a red panda climb a rope ladder any better than–

MATT: As the rest of the party climbs their way up, during Vex and Keyleth's bickering over what form Trinket should take, Trinket, if you've ever seen a bear roll its eyes before, this is the moment. As it fills the entire tunnel it goes (bear noises), with a kill-me-now expression. Eventually, you decide on a red panda.

MARISHA: Yeah, it's a good breed.

MATT: The mystical red panda from Wildemount. You extend your hand and Trinket's form shrinks into this small, temporarily elevated red panda, and falls to the ground.

LAURA: Aww, I love you! He's so cute! I pick him up and I tell him to hang on to me.

MATT: He does and wraps around your neck like the foxtail you already have there. You guys climb up and as you emerge, you see now, you're at the very, very back of an alleyway that is buttressed against the inside of the outer wall. So you're inside the city. You're in this small, very, very well-out-of-the-way alleyway, this back alley that ends at your outhouse, as well as a secondary one next to you that appears to be functional, based on the smell. And there is trash and junk back here. It's definitely one of the forgotten corners of Emon.

TALIESIN: You have your map.

SAM: Yeah, we're right here. Where's Gilmore's again?

MATT: Abdar's Promenade, to the northeastern–

LAURA: Stealth. Can we all stealth?

SAM: That's up here. Wow, we have to cross the entire city.

MARISHA: And we've got Pass Without a Trace.

SAM: But we could go along the wall.

LAURA: Let's do it.

SAM: All the way along the outside wall.

MARISHA: Do we want to go through the city or along the outside of the city? Are we going to take the long way or the direct path?

LIAM: The long way, the slow way, the careful way.

SAM: Take the beltway?

LIAM: Stealthy.

TALIESIN: Stealthy.

MATT: All right. Everyone roll stealth, please.

LAURA: You add ten because–

SAM: We add ten?

MATT: Ashley, stealth for you as well with disadvantage, but you add ten. Still there, Ashley?

LAURA: Oh, no!

TRAVIS: Ashley?

LIAM: I'm hanging up on you. I still love you, but I'm going to hang up.

MATT: All right, so, call back, and you guys, stealth checks?

TALIESIN: 39.

MARISHA: 19.

SAM: 25.

LAURA: 33.

TRAVIS: 23.

LIAM: 25.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: You added ten?

LIAM: What?

LAURA: Add ten to it. Pass Without a Trace.

LIAM: 35, then, motherfuckers.

TALIESIN: Wait, 29, sorry.

MATT: Okay, there we go, and 19 with the plus ten?

MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled shitty.

MATT: Okay, all right. There we go. Hi, Ashley.

MARISHA: Sorry, Ashley.

LAURA: Can she hear?

LIAM: (robot voice) Hello, I am Pike. I am happy to be here.

TALIESIN: I forgot you can do that.

LIAM: Ashley rolled a four. She texted me.

LAURA: So 14.

MATT: Okay, so you guys step out of this alleyway and the first thing that catches you is the visual.

LAURA: Chained back up the outhouse.

MATT: Okay, so you chained it back and put the lock back on. As you step back out into the center of the first road you come across, the crossroads to this alleyway, you look up and can see there are, even through the night, a good two dozen streams of smoke billowing out from different parts of the city, where, throughout the entire evening, there has been buildings burning, crumbling, or fires of indeterminate origin throughout the city that are still spreading. There's the perpetual smell of smoke and dust in the air, and you can see every now and then, the wind will blow a bit and a little bit of ash will be thrown up in the air and come to rest. Much of what you see around you is intact, the buildings directly around you on this side, everything seems intact, though there's very little signs of life on this immediate corner. It looks like either everyone is inside or this part of the city has been abandoned or people are keeping out of the streets at this point. So, what do you guys want to do?

LAURA: Go along the wall to the other side to get to Gilmore's?

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Sneaky.

MATT: All right. You guys coast along the wall, to the very southward side, trudging up across the main gate, which as you can see now– there's normally a very heavy guard presence on the south gate to Emon. The gate is currently partially opened and you can see a bunch of the guards as well as a number of individuals in the city currently frozen in place in the midst of a sudden bit of chaos. You can see the guards with shields and pikes at the ready, screaming and looking up into the sky, their final moment trapped now in that frozen horrifying visage. You see people running, trying to make their way out of the gate, and couldn't quite get past in time and the gate itself has a large sheet of ice that is frozen against it that's slowly thawing. You can see the ground around them is turning muddy with all the moisture that's slowly melting away as the day progresses.

LAURA: And they're like the people in our keep? They're past the point of healing?

MATT: You can certainly check and inquire.

LIAM: They've been here for eight hours at least. They're gone.

TRAVIS: Yeah, leave it.

LAURA: I want to see if Cure Wounds is– I'm going to just try?

MARISHA: I assist.

MATT: Okay. So you go up and reach out and cast Cure Wounds on one of the frozen bodies, and your hands touch it and you can feel the ice because it's still very cold to the touch, though it's damp and the moisture is gathering and dripping down off certain elbows and portions of the body that are the lowest. You complete the spell and feel the warmth of the cure spell extend past your fingers with no sign of reaction or life within the body. This poor woman, apron on, looking over her shoulder running, holding what little belongings she had, is there, her final moment captured as she stares off in the direction of where you assume Vorugal swooped towards the south gate, before making their way towards Greyskull Keep the night before.

TRAVIS: Let's go before we're discovered, quickly.

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: As you guys tread across the main thoroughfare, and it's the one point where you are inescapably out in the open, and as you're taking a moment touching the corpse of this woman frozen in place, Vex, you catch out the corner of your eye what appears to be a figure stepping towards you in the center of the street.

SAM: Wait, you see someone?

MATT: As you notify the rest of the group, you guys look over and you can see now, stepping from one of the alleyways, there is a humanoid figure walking through the road, cloak draped behind in the back, hood up, wide shoulders, and is not seemingly making any attempt to be unseen or really hiding their presence. This is someone who is beelining for your group in this moment.

MARISHA: He's heading towards us?

MATT: Yes.

MARISHA: Yeah, does he see us?

MATT: Heading right towards you.

LAURA: I take out a arrow and say, stop!

MARISHA: I do flame hands.

MATT: Okay. The figure stops for a moment and pulls the hood back, and you can see now, revealed, a– looking humanoid but the features are more intense and thick. A very square jaw. The skin has a slight grayish-green tint to it. What looks like one tooth underneath, and this is a half-orc individual. Wearing a black cloak and very simple studded leather armor. If our guest would like to step on to the stage.

ALL: Ooh!

LIAM: Yeah! Mixing it up!

MATT: So, just to let you guys know, we have a guest joining us this evening. The illustrious and talented Jason Charles Miller, who is an–

SAM: Where is he going?

MATT: Between you guys right there. Yeah, there you go.

MARISHA: Come squeeze.

MATT: Jason is going to join us for this evening of gameplay.

JASON: My first action will require me to get up, so.

MATT: Okay, well, get low for a moment, so I can introduce you. So you can say hey! This is Jason. Jason is a voice actor, actually the voice of Drizzt Do'Urden right now, if you know who–

MARISHA: Oh, shut the fuck up! I didn't know that!

MATT: Yeah, so that's pretty awesome. As well as the writer of our theme song, our Critical Role theme song, which we are working on a new intro right now. And in the near future we will have that for you guys.

MARISHA: You can download it on iTunes.

MATT: Yes, you can. We will have that coming out soon but yes, so Jason, thanks for joining us tonight.

JASON: Sure, thanks for having me.

MARISHA: Hi, Jason.

MATT: We'll give you the full, whole– at end the show, but nonetheless the half-orc approaches, lowers his hood.

JASON: Okay, so I actually start speaking in Thieves' Cant to Vex here, so I've got to whisper something.

MATT: Okay, go for it. So as the orc lowers his hood, he begins to–

MARISHA: Why don't you make him come over here?

LAURA: Who are you talking about?

JASON: Vax, sorry, the– The person that can speak Thieves' Cant.

LAURA: I can speak Thieves' Cant, too.

JASON: But I'm talking to him.

TALIESIN: Thieves can't speak. Ooh.

MATT: And whispers to the two of them.

MARISHA: These are tiny tables.

MATT: So suddenly the orc begins to utter a series of strange sounds like double talk and gibberish.

LAURA: I'm reading his damn lips as he's doing it.

MATT: All right, and you, knowing Thieves' Cant, pick up the details. So you can let her know as well. The rest of you see this orc speaking nonsense and a very brief reaction from the twins.

MARISHA: Look, he's been under a lot of stress, all right?

LIAM: He's trying to get us to join scientology, that's all.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Our thetan levels are off the charts right now.

TALIESIN: My thetan level's at 16 right now.

LAURA: You're a member of the Clasp, then?

JASON: Yes.

MARISHA: Oh.

JASON: You're the first faces I recognize. I've been hiding here since the attack.

MARISHA: You recognized us, why? How?

JASON: I'm a member of the Clasp.

LIAM: Did you all make it?

MARISHA: We were there recently.

LIAM: What's left?

JASON: I don't know. I was on a mission up above ground when the attack happened. I'm trying desperately to get back to see who is left. My name is Garthok.

SAM: Garthok?

JASON: Yes.

SAM: We are Vox Machina. I am the de facto leader. My name is Scanlan Shorthalt.

JASON: I know who you are, and you are the first people I've made myself visible to. You're the first people that I recognize or even know that I can trust.

MARISHA: Have you been through the city? How much is left?

JASON: It is not– it's indescribable. There is incredible destruction.

MARISHA: Have you encountered any more survivors?

MATT: Which you have. As you walked through the city, you have noticed there are many survivors of the town. A lot of them have kept inside, but there are a number that are actually running through and looting the town.

LAURA: Ugh.

LIAM: What was your name again?

JASON: Garthok.

LIAM: Garthok. What of the Spirelings? What of the leaders of the Clasp?

JASON: All I know is what I knew before the attack.

LIAM: We've come here looking for survivors. We don't intend to stay long. You are welcome to come with us.

LAURA: Are you one of the people looting? You said you saw other people doing the same.

JASON: I'm not a looter. I was on a classified mission above ground, and now that's all gone to shit basically, so I'm trying to get back to our headquarters.

SAM: Garthok, are you familiar with tunnels or secret passageways around the city at all?

JASON: You could say yes. Absolutely.

SAM: Are we near any?

LAURA: We need to get across town and not be seen.

MARISHA: We are trying to get to the Abdar's Promenade.

LIAM: Wait, show me your brand.

MATT: He reveals the back of the cloak and you do indeed see the brand of the Clasp. The same one you carry between the shoulder blades.

MARISHA: Do you know each other?

(laughter)

LIAM: It's a pretty big organization.

MATT: There are certain tunnels that traverse underneath Emon, specifically amongst the Clasp. However, two of the locations to the south of the city, one in the Graveyard District and one in the Temple District, which you guys are adjacent to right now, those are the two that immediately come to mind. The Temple one that you are nearby seeking has been completely demolished and is unusable. There's one to the Graveyard District. There's one north of Abdar's Promenade that could possibly be of use to you. Those are the only ones that come to mind that are nearby.

TALIESIN: Well, if we're heading that way anyway. We stop by Gilmore's and we do need to check in with the Clasp, anyway.

LIAM: Maybe.

TALIESIN: They're going to be helpful.

LIAM: Maybe.

TRAVIS: Are we out in the open right now?

MATT: You are out in the open right now.

TRAVIS: Can we fucking get inside, please?

LIAM: We need to get to Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Do you know where that is?

JASON: Yes, I can lead you there.

LIAM: Underground?

JASON: I could, if the temple entrance wasn't destroyed.

MARISHA: I might be able to clear it out.

TRAVIS: You want to walk towards the temple?

SAM: We're near the Temple District now.

MARISHA: We can take the tunnels under–

SAM: But if the entrance to the tunnel was destroyed, it's best not to risk it. Let's keep going.

LAURA: And we'll make a lot of noise clearing it out.

TALIESIN: That's true.

LAURA: Best to skirt.

LIAM: Building to building.

SAM: Are you okay with stealth?

MARISHA: I might be able to tunnel us to the closest tunnel system, from right here.

LAURA: Do it then.

MATT: How do you intend to do this?

MARISHA: Move Earth. Sixth level.

LAURA: Whoa, you're using a 6th-level spell right now?

MARISHA: Do we want to do it now?

SAM: We're not near the entrance to the tunnel right now.

LAURA: No, let's just stealth it. Yeah, save that.

TALIESIN: We can save that for an emergency.

MARISHA: I'll save it.

MATT: Okay. It will take you, at the rate at which it moves earth, it will take you probably a good hour to two hours to–

MARISHA: To get to the tunnels?

MATT: To get to any sort of system that he may be referring to.

MARISHA: All right, let's just walk. We'll walk faster.

MATT: All right, so, Garthok, I'm going to have you roll a stealth check to move alongside the rest of the group.

JASON: Great. 25.

MARISHA: Does he benefit from Pass Without a Trace?

MATT: No, he arrived after the spell was cast, but as you guys move forward, he also dives into the shadows in a very similar way that you've seen Vax do before. This orc definitely understands the resources of light and the absence of it.

TALIESIN: He's played some Assassin's Creed.

MATT: (laughs) He's hitting you all up in the shoulders for change. All right, so–

LIAM: Is that a dice game?

TALIESIN: It's a band, they're very good.

MATT: So, as you guys push forward, staying towards the outskirts of the city, you do come across, on the outer area of the Temple District, a humble neighborhood that has been completely reduced to cinders and ash. There is probably a good eight to ten buildings that are piles of black, still burning wood, dust, and broken stone. You can see on the outskirts of some of these piles of rubble, bodies lying in the street, the skin charred black and cracked as the face and arms are curled up in the final moments of agony. You avert your gaze and continue pressing onward and you can see now, many of these large temples in the center of the city, you can see folks gathered to them and clustered on the inside, you can hear people shouting and folks trying to deal with this current circumstance befalling the town. You continue to move out of the sight of those clusters of survivors that are going to their various deities for aid and comfort. You push further towards the center of the Temple District. You do catch out of the left the sound of breaking glass, specifically to you, Vex, in the distance. As you glance over and look, you can see four individuals climb out of a window with sacks over their shoulders. They all gesture to each other and go running off northward, deeper into the city, carrying whatever goods they managed to acquire from the interior. And as you progress, you do notice a lot of windows have been broken. You don't know if from the inside or outside. Some may have been from the impact of the attack, some may have been from individuals that have been moving from building to building. It's hard to say at this point, there's such disarray around you. As you skirt along the very far end of the Temple District, you see a portion of the neighborhood now is in itself encased in ice, like the individuals you saw at the south gate. This is another area where Vorugal made its way through, and you can see another array of icy coffins of other individuals who were trying to escape but were locked in place. You can see a small group of living Emon residents that are currently gathering the dead and trying to take them out of the open and possibly give them a proper burial, whether it be people they know or not, but there is a look on each of their faces of desolate acceptance of what is happening and trying to process this–

TRAVIS: Can I slink back to Vax? And I say: you still think that what was inside that skull is worse than all of this?

LIAM: I think it is probably equal to this. We've been burned before, Grog. This was going to happen whether we wanted it to or not.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but we could have done something about it. I walk on.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: Big if, big man.

MATT: The clouds are beginning to gather up over the sky as you continue forward and the little bit of sunshine that came through this morning is now covered in coming rain clouds. Which may be a boon to those buildings that still burn and possibly an annoyance to a giant, fire-based red dragon in the center of the city but, nevertheless, the weather is quickly shifting. As you begin pushing into Abdar's Promenade, you can see the central bazaar before you, the memory of it, this sprawling landscape of multicolored tents and carts and what was this bustling marketplace is all closed down and a portion of it appears to have been torn through. You can see broken bits of wood and wagon wheels tossed asunder like, apparently, one of these dragons may have smashed into the center and let loose its fury. You can see spatters of blood across elements of the ground, but no sign of a body, as there are a few groups going around, trying to gather what they can, but the place is also picked clean. You notice a lot of these tents and carts are empty of any real valuables. You are uncertain whether or not the proprietors took it themselves or they have been picked clean by looters.

LAURA: Scavengers.

MATT: You begin to approach, with a very, very nervous heart, the corner of the bazaar that leads to Gilmore's place. As you approach, the nervousness is met with the visual of a large stack of black smoke that rises from that direction. As you push through with increased haste towards that area of the bazaar, you see Gilmore's Glorious Goods, as well as two other adjacent buildings, completely destroyed. Piles of rubble and what looks to be a group of about ten individuals that are currently picking through the rubble and gathering what they can, moving over wood and brick.

LIAM: I stop stealthing and walk right into it and start shouting, (shouting) get the fuck out of here! Get out!

MATT: As you do that, all of them turn over, looks and one says, “Hey, get your own shit, all right?”

LIAM: Move on now! Now! Now!

MATT: He stops and looks about the other one. The other guys looking over their shoulders and, “Look, we're all just trying to stay alive here, okay?”

TALIESIN: I pull out my gun. You heard the man.

TRAVIS: Yeah, big sword comes out, too.

MARISHA: Fire hands.

LAURA: Don't test us.

MARISHA: We've had a really shitty day.

MATT: “You've had a shitty day?”

MARISHA: We've all had a shitty day

MATT: “Well, let's make it all sorts more shitty.” And he pulls a shortsword from his side and all the rest of them pull their blades out and they say, “Look, we saw this first. We're going to bring it to him and save ourselves.”

LIAM: I'll fucking gut you like a fish–

LAURA: Stop!

LIAM: –and take your innards–

LAURA: Stop!

LIAM: – out your mouth. I will not!

LAURA: Stop. You will take it to him?

MARISHA: Who's him?

LAURA: Thordak?

MATT: They all, with their weapons out, tense their shoulders and say, “There's only one way we are going to survive this.”

LAURA: Listen. There's so much more available to you, buildings up that way. Not worth your time right here.

MATT: (laughs) “Honey, we've already picked plenty clean from this pile. This is our third time back.”

TRAVIS: It'll be your last time back if you're not careful.

LAURA: Is it worth your death? Bringing this to him, is it worth your death? Because you will die here.

MATT: “You know what, I think I stand a better chance against the lot of you than with that thing.”

MARISHA: You just thought wrong.

LAURA: Step on and go find loot somewhere else. At least then you can present it to him and not die here. Don't be stupid.

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

TRAVIS: Vex, please let me off the chain.

LAURA: Ugh, I rolled so poorly. Anybody want to assist me?

MATT: It's a little late for that.

LAURA: (sings) How about ten?

MATT: Okay. You can see as he's holding his shortsword to the side, goes, “You know, you may be stupid, but there are other stupid things in this town, like walking in the middle of an ambush, dear.” At which point, a dagger comes past–

LAURA: I've got passive perception!

MATT: I know.

LAURA: Motherfuck!

MATT: You instinctually move your head out the way as it (whoosh) past you as you see another individual that was keeping low to the rubble flung a dagger at you, and the rest of them pull their weapons ready and are about to enter a fray. I need everyone to roll initiative.

MARISHA: Fuck these assholes!

TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted.

LAURA: Natural fucking 20.

MARISHA: Therapeutic ass-kicking. That's pretty good.

SAM: They may win.

MARISHA: Nah. Fuck that. We're way more pissed off–

SAM: They work for a dragon.

LAURA: Do they? They're just looters.

TALIESIN: This is going to feel really good.

MARISHA: Yeah.

SAM: But they're innocent.

MARISHA: Yeah, we're not going to kill them. We'll just beat their faces in.

LAURA: Garthok, did you lead us here? Did you know about this?

JASON: No.

SAM: I believe him.

MARISHA: Insight check. Can I insight check him?

TALIESIN: We literally just walked to where we were going. He lead us precisely where we wanted to go. There's nothing clever about that trap.

MATT: All right, so, placement, guys. Where would you like to be on this one?

TALIESIN: I suppose we'd be hanging back a bit. Well, you got up in their face, so you're–

MARISHA: The three of us got up in their face.

TRAVIS: I was walking with Vax.

TALIESIN: I was hanging back a bit.

MARISHA: I think Scanlan and Pike were towards the back. I'm next to Percy.

MATT: And Vex, you're up here?

LAURA: Sure, why not.

MATT: You were up in their face right here.

LAURA: In his face and I have Trinket on my back.

SAM: Which one is Jason Charles Miller?

MATT: Jason is–

TALIESIN: Gart-Garthluk.

JASON: Garthok.

TALIESIN: Garthok, Garthok, I'm close. I'm getting it, Garthok.

MATT: Garthok, where do you want to be?

JASON: I'm ready to tangle.

MATT: All right, we'll put you over here, in the middle of the group being watched. The rest of these thugs are all currently sitting over in this rubble.

MARISHA: What do you think, Garthok? I don't know, what do you think, Waynethok?

JASON: (laughs) Party on, Garthok. Party on, Waynethok.

(laughter)

MATT: All right. So, I would like–

SAM: Should we be at all concerned about drawing attention to ourselves?

LAURA: Too late for that.

SAM: No, I mean, like, giant Fireballs or anything?

LAURA: Probably stay away from huge magical effects.

LIAM: Fireball straight into the sky!

MATT: Yeah, there you go, that'd be perfect. All right, so, initiatives 25 to 20 or higher?

LAURA: 27. Natural 20.

SAM: Natural 27.

TALIESIN: 25.

MATT: Percy. 20 to 15?

MARISHA: 17.

MATT: Keyleth. All right, 15 to ten? What do we got?

JASON: 14.

SAM: 12.

LIAM: 12.

TRAVIS: 14.

MATT: All right, so we got–

TRAVIS: Two 12s and two 14s.

MATT: And then 12 and 12. All righty. And is Pike not able to–

LIAM: I'll try!

LAURA: Pike lost completely all connection.

SAM: Pike fell down in some rubble.

MATT: I'll roll for her. (laughs) Pike's going last. I figure she probably would have rolled last anyways, so Pike is last.

LAURA: Yeah, I think she said she was probably going to have to leave until the break until we can figure out the tech.

MATT: Gotcha! Okay, no worries. Top of the round. Vex, since you are the one who got the first attack and immediately reacting to it. You're up. What are you doing?

LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on that motherfucker in front of me. And then I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at all of them in front of me, like a big cone effect.

MATT: Okay. Okay, so, Conjure Barrage is your action, so that's your full thing. So, at which direction are you doing it?

LAURA: Just towards all the guys in front of me. I want to get as many in the cone as I can.

MATT: Okay, you probably need to move this way or else you're going to hit your brother as well.

LAURA: Oh, that's my brother.

MATT: That's your brother right there.

LAURA: I can see what's happening now. Yeah, I move over then I–

MATT: That's a 60 foot?

LAURA: It's a 60-foot cone.

MATT: Yeah, right there. So all four of them are affected. Great.

LAURA: Great. So, Trinket is still on my back. He's a red panda.

MATT: Yeah. Until she breaks concentration.

LAURA: I fire it and I shoot forward and that's it, huh? I don't have to, like–

MATT: Conjure Barrage, you roll damage and they get to save.

LAURA: Okay, cool. So I'm going to cast that at– oh, it's already at third level, okay.

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: Whoa. 15? And then I add my type anything? Or it's just 15.

MATT: It's just 15, and then you add 1d6 for the one dude for Hunter's Mark.

LAURA: For my Hunter's Mark. Do I add my Bracers of Archery, though, on that?

MATT: Technically– You know what, sure. Because it is technically a ranged attack. I'll let it happen, sure.

LAURA: 17 and an additional six on–

MATT: On that guy? Okay, what's your DC of your spells?

LAURA: 15.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Do I add my spell attack bonus?

MATT: You don't have to roll to attack. This just happens and they have to try and save to get out of the way.

LAURA: I understand.

MATT: Cool. All right so, that's 17 damage to– those two take half there.

LAURA: I don't understand.

LIAM: It will sink in in a few episodes. It's fine.

MATT: All right. Cool. All right so, as you release this spraying torrent of arrows down the way. It fires outward. All of them all of a sudden have to put their arms up to instinctually defend themselves with arrows piercing bits of their armor and ricochet off. It's not horribly damaging, but enough to sweep into all of them and they all immediately look up angrily at each other, weapons at the ready to go ahead and get vengeance.

LAURA: I take the rest of my moment to back up against a wall.

MATT: Okay. Right there. All righty, Percy, you're up next.

TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to Hex the one that she Hunter's Marked.

MATT: Oh man.

LAURA: Fuck that guy.

MATT: All righty.

MARISHA: (laughs) Fuck that one guy in particular.

TALIESIN: And I'm going to– Where am I? Oh, there I am. I'm going to run towards that other wall to the left.

MATT: This way?

TALIESIN: Yep, all the while taking a few shots at that bastard who I just hexed.

MATT: As you are moving you're like (gunshots). Okay. Go for it.

TALIESIN: Oh, and Sharpshooter shots, because that's funnier. So that's, ugh–

MARISHA: But you're Percy.

TALIESIN: Yeah, so that's not– That's 14 to hit.

MATT: 14 hits.

TALIESIN: Should I just roll all three shots?

MATT: Yeah, roll three shots.

TALIESIN: That's 20. That hits.

MATT: That hits.

TALIESIN: And 18. That hits.

MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and roll damage for all three shots, and an additional 1d6 to each shot.

TALIESIN: Oh yeah. That's ten, 26, 27 points. 26 points plus one necrotic. That's on the other end of things.

MARISHA: The opposite! (laughs) The exact opposite.

TALIESIN: Irony. 17 points plus six necrotic.

MATT: All righty.

TALIESIN: And for my final roll. 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 points plus six necrotic.

MARISHA: That guy is dead, right?

MATT: All right so, as you go running by (gunshots) each shot as it impacts, the guy who's already dealing with the array of arrows in his chest, each shot that blows across his shoulders is followed by a plume of black-purple smoke that blasts off each impact until it leaves a hole off this shoulder. This actually blows this arm off from the impact. And the third one just destroys the upper part of his head and he slinks back onto the rubble.

TALIESIN: I move my Hex to the next guy and point at him as I'm running.

LAURA: I move my Hunter's Mark to the next guy because the other one went to zero.

TRAVIS: That's some Hateful Eight shit right there.

MATT: (laughs) All right, you have to use a bonus action to mark a new creature. Both you guys do.

LAURA: Oh.

MATT: So those will be– Those move over when– (gunshot impact) He is blown off the map essentially.

LAURA: It said when it went down to zero, I could move it to the next person.

MATT: If the target drops to zero hit points, you can use a bonus action on subsequent turns of yours to mark a new creature.

LAURA: I understand.

MATT: I know.

LIAM: There's so many rules, guys!

MATT: All right, it's their turn now. So, out the side, after that final shot, you hear a little guttural grunt off to your left as you see this dwarf with a giant hammer come rushing up. “You! "How dare you!” And comes swinging off towards your direction there, off to the side. These guys here are going to move in. Both of these are going to run up to Grog, being the larger there.

TRAVIS: Just signed your death certificate.

MATT: That guy comes up to Keyleth. These two come rushing around.

LAURA: Oh shit, there's two more?

MATT: Yep.

LAURA: I didn't see those guys.

MATT: No, you didn't.

LAURA: I saw one of them, but I didn't see all of them.

MATT: That guy can only get that far, so he's going to go ahead and throw. All right, so–

LAURA: They're going to get sneak attacks on me.

MATT: Indeed. All right, so, first and foremost, the dwarf comes up against you, Percy. That's going to be an 18 to hit.

TALIESIN: My armor class is 18.

MATT: So it hits, yeah. And it's going to hit you again this time. That's going to be 15, so only–

TALIESIN: I was about to say, can I take that first 18 and make it– nah, you know what, I'll take the hit, never mind.

MATT: Okay. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage from the smack of the mace.

TALIESIN: Okay.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: Slap-a the mace.

MATT: Two guys against Grog now, their maces out as well. Because they have pack tactics, they both have advantage on attacks against you. So with that, that's a 19.

TRAVIS: Hits.

MATT: Hits. And the other one, with advantage, is a natural 20.

MARISHA: Ouch.

MATT: You're not raging yet, so you take full damage. All right, ten points of bludgeoning damage on the first hit. And the second one, that's going to be 15 points of bludgeoning damage. So a total of 25 points of bludgeoning damage as both of them whack you with maces from each side, with the first round of attacks. Now the second round of attacks, because they attack twice.

LAURA: Ugh.

MATT: With advantage. That's a 21, which hits.

TRAVIS: Yep.

MATT: And a 15.

TRAVIS: Nope.

MATT: So you then take seven points of bludgeoning damage after that.

TRAVIS: Yep.

MATT: Cool. So that's two. There's one against you, Vax. He doesn't get advantage against you. He rolls a 17.

LIAM: I'm going to use Uncanny Dodge– No! It doesn't hit because I've got both daggers out.

MATT: Oh yeah, because you get bonus AC.

LIAM: I have three armor classes depending on if my boots are on or my daggers are in my hands.

MATT: Right. Okay, cool. Good to know. All right, so then leading up to that, there's one against you, Keyleth.

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: That's going to be a 14 and a natural 20. That is going to be 15 points of bludgeoning damage against you.

MARISHA: All right.

MATT: Whack! As the mace swings past and catches you right across the chin, the impact causes your head to snap for a second. A very minor moment of whiplash, as you look back and feel the blood trickling down.

MARISHA: Ah!

MATT: Yeah, and then there's two against you, Vex. Which both get advantage because of pack tactics. 13, even with advantage. The second attack is 23, and the other one does two attacks, 22 and 17. 17 doesn't hit? Okay, so that's three attacks on you that hit.

LAURA: No, two attacks hit.

MATT: Oh, two attacks. You take nine points of bludgeoning damage and six points of bludgeoning damage.

LAURA: Okay!

MATT: And the one that's over here, there's nobody immediately around for it pull its mace out. Instead, he pulls out his heavy crossbow, lines up, and aims at you, Scanlan.

SAM: Oh, what? Who, me?

MATT: Yep.

SAM: But I'm– Oh.

MATT: And that is 21 to hit.

SAM: That hits.

MATT: You then suffer ten points of piercing damage as the heavy crossbow bolt sinks itself into your shoulder and the armor takes the brunt of it but you can still feel the pain of it piercing just about an inch through.

SAM: Damn it.

MATT: That ends their go. Next up, we have Keyleth.

MARISHA: All right, I'm really pissed off at this guy who just decked me in the face. So I'm going to cast Call Lightning.

MATT: All righty.

MARISHA: And can I reach out and, the guy who hit me, can I reach out and grab him and call it right into him?

TRAVIS: Like conductor-style.

MARISHA: Yeah. Just grab his face after he just punched me.

MATT: Okay. So, the minute you do that, the Polymorph fades and Trinket turns into a full bear.

MARISHA: Dope! Even cooler! Totally meant to do that.

MATT: You can, but know wherever the bolt hits, it's everything in a five-foot area. So you can hit the bolt behind him–

MARISHA: Nah, I want to–

MATT: You want to take it?

MARISHA: I want to take it.

MATT: All right.

MARISHA: I'm pissed the fuck off.

MATT: So, as you put your hands up, the clouds that are already forming from the storm–

MARISHA: I was going to say, I get extra damage, right?

MATT: Yeah. They begin to grow darker and directly above you and as you bring your hands up, your flames slowly drifting off your fingertips, you bring your hand down, and as you do, a bolt of lightning comes streaking out of the sky, blasting right into the guy in front of you. Go ahead and roll damage.

MARISHA: Is it four? Do I get an extra d10? Is that what I get, or–

MATT: You get an additional d10, yes. 4d10 lightning damage.

MARISHA: Do I get anything extra because I'm holding on to him? Because I'm channeling it?

MATT: I'll say no, that's more–

TALIESIN: Fire damage?

MATT: No, that would be a different attack, unfortunately. You're holding him and the flames are licking up into his face. So it's a scary visual.

MARISHA: 25 points.

MATT: 25 points of damage. He did not make the save, I believe. Rolled a 15. What's your DC on that spell?

MARISHA: 18.

MATT: Yeah. So the bolt comes down and I need you to go ahead and make a save against your own spell.

MARISHA: Yep. Failed.

MATT: Okay, so you also take that damage.

MARISHA: Yep.

MATT: But it was cool.

MARISHA: I use my bonus action to go Minxie.

LAURA: Whoa, I like it! We ain't seen Minxie in a while.

MARISHA: Yeah, it's been a while.

LAURA: Nice!

MATT: As the guy's looking, reeling from the impact of the blast, he pulls away, smoke coming off his chest. He gets his mace ready as he looks up and sees you change into this giant white sabretooth tiger with these claws–

MARISHA: I get a little bit of foam going, you know.

LAURA: I like that right before it he saw a giant bear appear.

(laughter)

MATT: Yeah, it just got somehow weirder.

MARISHA: This means I can finally use my gift from Mary!

MATT: All right. That ends Keyleh's turn. Garthok, you're up.

JASON: Great, I move over and take that one on–

MATT: Over here?

JASON: Keep going straight. No, no, the other way. No. Okay now. Sorry. Yes. No, wait, okay, I was going to go to–

MATT: You have laser pointers at the table.

SAM: Someone give him a laser pointer.

MARISHA: Sorry, I had it and I was distracted.

JASON: There.

MATT: Oh, right here? Got you, okay. So you rush up to there.

JASON: And I flank. Since they're engaged, can I use my sneak attack?

MATT: Yeah, if you hit, you hit with the sneak attack. So as you rush out very quickly, you see he pulls out a spear, like a short spear, but it's curved kris-like at the blade and it's smaller than most short spears you've seen. It's a custom piece of work. And he slides up and attempts to jam it into the thug in front of you.

LIAM and LAURA: Get it!

JASON: 15.

MATT: 15 hits. Go ahead and roll damage and sneak attack damage.

JASON: Hell yeah. So, let's see, I need some more d6s. Do you want me to do the sneak attack damage first or the weapon damage first, or add it all at the end?

MATT: Just add it all together and then add your modifier at the end.

MARISHA: Grr. I'm so excited.

MATT: Grog, you're on deck, so be ready.

MARISHA: This is what life is about, you guys.

MATT: This was the night Marisha took somebody's eyes out.

MARISHA: (laughs) I know, I know.

JASON: 28.

MATT: 28 points of damage. Nice! All righty. So, as the spear easily pierces past armor and you can see the haggard-looking woman then looks over and the spear itself is stuck in her midsection. As you withdraw it, you can see a gout of blood pour out afterward of the wound itself, leaving behind a pretty nasty–

JASON: My eyes widen in battle-lust.

(laughter)

MATT: Orc jaw quivers, the teeth exposed. Okay, is that your turn?

JASON: Yes.

MATT: Okay, you still have a bonus action if you wanted to disengage.

JASON: Oh, yeah. So I can disengage without attack of opportunity?

MATT: If you use disengage and then move past. You moved three spaces. You can disengage and move back four more spaces if you want to, with your speed. Your call. Or you can stay there and lock him in place.

JASON: You know what? I'm going to stay.

MATT: Okay, cool. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: After taking a few hits from the sacrificial lamb that stands between Vax and I, I unsheathe Craven Edge, feeling the goosebumps rush up my skin, and I look down at him and say, please run. And I draw the blade across my hand and I go into a frenzied rage.

(laughter)

MATT: All righty. At which point, the blood touching the blade, it curves down the obsidian and then sinks into the actual weapon. It doesn't even have a moment to drip before the blade seems to absorb the blood that you put on it.

TRAVIS: We're bonded. It's a match made in heaven. I would also like to use reckless attack as I take my three attacks at this piece of shit.

MATT: Well, it's a bonus action to rage, so you get two attacks this turn.

TRAVIS: Two attacks this turn.

MATT: Yeah. Reckless attack it up, man.

TRAVIS: That is a 19.

MATT: That hits. These are Great Weapon Master?

TRAVIS: Yes. And that is– not great, that's 11.

MATT: 11 still hits. These guys aren't very well-armored.

LAURA: Loser! Loser with your 11 AC!

TRAVIS: That's a 22 for the first one.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: 19 on the second one.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: And they both have to make the DC saving throw.

MATT: Both against the same individual?

TRAVIS: Yeah, same guy.

MATT: Makes the first save with a 19. Fails the second one. So the first strike streaks across. You can see it cuts a huge gash across the upper body as the burly-looking looter glances back at you (heavy breathing). Brings up a shortsword and is about to go in for the pierce, at which point you kick her away from you about a foot and draw the blade around, and this time you run the blade right into her torso, piercing her through. As she looks up at you, you can see her skin go pale as her strength is drawn into the blade. You get to add a point to your strength.

LAURA: What! How long does that last?

MATT: That lasts until your next short rest.

LAURA: Don't rest ever!

(laughter)

MATT: So yeah, your strength's now 18, so add plus one to your attack damage going forward.

TRAVIS: Plus one to damage?

MATT: Yeah. To hit and damage with your attacks. But you pull the blade out and she crumples to the ground.

LAURA: So for every person you hit, it makes it better and better and better!

TRAVIS: Can I look over my shoulder to the guy on the left and like, you're next!

MATT: You very much can. You can see the visual of this presentation seems to have shaken their resolve, though not enough to the point where they're backing down yet. The desperation kicks in. All right, that ends your turn, Grog? You're staying there?

TRAVIS: I'll stay there.

MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Okay, so the guy next to Percy is the dwarf?

MATT: Correct.

SAM: Okay. I will hand-cone it up and I will cast Dominate Person on him.

MATT: (laughs) Okay!

SAM: And I will try to bend him to my will.

MATT: That is a failed save and a half.

SAM: Okay, good.

MATT: We'll say for the purposes of that, we'll use the blue one. So, yeah. As a bonus action each turn, you can basically tell him what to do.

SAM: Okay. I will tell him to walk over to me and start emptying his pockets of anything he's looted. Straight-up.

(laughter)

MATT: The dwarf's face goes limp and drops the mace on the ground and looks over towards you, the eyes glazed over, and goes, “Certainly, Master. It would be my pleasure.” And begins to rifle through the pockets. Okay. You want to move anywhere or you staying where you are?

SAM: No, I'll stay there to accept my treasure.

(laughter)

MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: Okay, so, I'm going to take the Dagger of Life-Stealing and I'm going to stab the person closer to you, yeah? So that's a 23.

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: So we'll do that first. That is 11. No, that's ten. Ten. And then I'm going to use disengage as my bonus action and I'm going to pivot, roll around Grog along the south side of him, and spin around and stick the Keen Dagger into the neck of the guy behind him. I'm going to use Luck. That's better. And that is 24.

MATT: All righty. That hits.

LIAM: That's sneak attack. 11 plus this.

MATT: So wait, this is with your– did you click your Boots of Haste on this?

LIAM: No. So two attacks?

MATT: You get two attacks, but you used your bonus action to disengage, which would've been your second attack, so you wouldn't get–

LIAM: Oh, then I'm out. All right, I'm out.

MATT: Okay. So you move over there?

LIAM: Yeah, I'll use disengage and I'm going to back up against Grog.

MATT: Okay, right there? All right. You're still in combat with that person.

LIAM: Back-to-back with the big man.

MATT: Great, so you guys are like back-to-back right now, looking around.

LAURA: Awesome. Look at you buddies!

LIAM: Uh, not really.

MATT: Pike, your turn!

ASHLEY: Okay, does anybody need healing?

LAURA: Not yet!

TRAVIS: Fuck somebody up.

ASHLEY: Time for attack!

(laughter)

ASHLEY: Am I close to the guy with the crossbow?

MATT: To which one? Crossbow, uh. You're about 20, 30 feet from him.

ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to move up a little bit, because I'm going to Guiding Bolt him.

MATT: All right.

ASHLEY: And I'm going to do it at second level.

MATT: 2nd-level Guiding Bolt.

ASHLEY: But first I will roll for–

MATT: All righty. So what'd you roll to hit? With your spell attack modifier?

ASHLEY: I rolled a 14.

MATT: 14 hits. That hits, so go ahead and roll 5d6 radiant damage on him.

LAURA: Fuck. Guiding Bolt's pretty sick.

ASHLEY: Nice. Cool. 21.

MATT: 21, nice! So as you rush forward, keeping your mace to the side, you put the shield down and the holy symbol itself drifts off you for a moment and you focus for a second and without having to put your hands on it, a beam of divine energy bursts forward, slamming into the crossbow-wielding individual and seems to surround their torso, causing them to glow like a giant beacon that says hit me! They look down at this tiny armored gnome that knocked half their life out of their body with a bit of confusion, worry, and respect in a weird way. Well done, gnome.

ASHLEY: Yeah!

MATT: Okay, does that end your turn?

ASHLEY: Can I try to intimidate him, to tell him to drop his bow?

MATT: Uh. As a bonus action, I'll let you do that, sure.

ASHLEY: All right. Drop your bow!

(laughter)

MATT: All right, go ahead and roll an intimidate check.

ASHLEY: Which I don't think I have any of that, let's see. Oh, this is going to be hilarious. 11!

MATT: 11. As you shout, the individual gives you a keen look and almost chuckles to himself, going, (laughs) “Silly gnome.”

ASHLEY: It was a joke! It was a joke.

MATT: Puts the crossbow up, aiming it right towards between the eyes.

ASHLEY: Oh no!

MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Awesome. As my bonus action I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns, so my next attack that hits turns into a poof.

MATT: Burst, yes.

LAURA: Okay. So I'm going to do that and then I'm going to cast– I'm going to shoot– oh shit. Can I shoot through the guy in front of me or to the guy with the bolt? Or is that too hard?

MATT: You can, you could, I'd say. You're at disadvantage already because you're in melee with two individuals, so all your attacks are at disadvantage right now.

LAURA: Balls.

MATT: You can try and move away.

LAURA: But they would hit me?

MATT: They would attack you.

LAURA: I'm going to move back five feet.

MATT: Okay, so you jump back that way.

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: All right, that's two of them get swings at you. That's a natural two, so no. That is a natural eight, so 13, so misses you.

LAURA: Fuck both of you, as I back up. And then I shoot the arrow at the guy in the middle of the two.

MATT: Right there? All right, go for it.

LAURA: Okay. That is 22 to hit.

MATT: That hits.

LAURA: Okay, so. That means– I'm casting that at third level, so that's 3d10 of damage.

MATT: Correct.

LAURA: Right. And that's just my first attack.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: Where's my other dice?

MATT: And it's 3d10 against the first one.

LAURA: Come on! That's seven, eight, nine.

MATT: Nine? All righty.

LAURA: Then, do I do that for each person or that's it?

MATT: No, you then roll a d10 and they have to make a dex saving throw to try and not get damage, so roll a d10.

LAURA: That's a ten.

MATT: They all fail, so did more damage to the guys around him than the actual–

LAURA: Nice. And then I'm going to move Trinket around. No, he's going to move up and attack the guy in front of him.

MATT: You've done a bonus and an action.

LAURA: Yeah, so I get to cast–

MATT: Oh, I see, so your attack second, third, and you get your one attack as part of the attack action.

LAURA: Right. So I wanted Trinket to do his Bestial Fury.

MATT: Okay, so move up now and do it to that–

LAURA: Yeah, he's doing Bestial Fury and claw that motherfucker.

MATT: Okay, this guy right there? Or that?

LAURA: That. No, the other one.

MATT: This one? All right. Go for it. So, as the bear that just appeared now rears back, you fire an arrow that explodes into a burst of sharpened wooden bits. As they all reel from the impact, the bear (roars) and Trinket rushes forward on his giant paws, releasing a torrent of claw strikes against one of the unsuspecting thugs.

LAURA: That's 14.

MATT: 14 hits.

LAURA: And then 2d4 plus seven.

MATT: Correct. You get two attacks with Trinket, by the way.

LAURA: Oh, sweet.

MATT: Because Trinket attacks twice when he does Bestial–

LAURA: That's 11 on the first.

MATT: 11 damage.

LAURA: And 13 on the second.

MATT: Okay. So Trinket runs forward and one claw tears the face off, jaw unhinged. The friend at the side looks horrified as Trinket then bears down with the secondary claw and takes the remainder of the head off the shoulders.

LAURA: Very nice, very nice.

SAM: Go Trinket.

MATT: Power in those claws. All right. That ends your turn?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: Is that crossbow asshole still standing?

MATT: The crossbow?

TALIESIN: The guy who just laughed at our little gnome?

MATT: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Okay. I've just noticed that my guy was going to hit me and then started acting weird, so taking a second to look around, I'm going to see that little laugh with the crossbow coming up and Indiana Jones that shit.

MATT: Okay. Are you putting your Hex on him?

TALIESIN: I'm putting my Hex on him first.

MATT: Okay, bonus action to do that.

TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shot to that guy.

MATT: Go for it.

SAM: Don't hit Pike, don't hit Pike.

TALIESIN: I'm not going to hit Pike.

SAM: She's right in the middle!

LIAM: Only if it's a one.

ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay.

TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, I'm trying to remember, what's my fuck-up number, my misfire number for that gun?

MATT: The pistol?

TALIESIN: Yeah.

MATT: One.

TALIESIN: It's higher than one, I thought.

MATT: No, the pistol's the most basic one. It's one. But you rebuilt it, though.

TALIESIN: I did.

MATT: To not be that terrible. So now it's fine, it's normal.

TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

MATT: Yeah. Before you reconstructed it to try and fix the mistake and remove that additional attachment, it would have been one.

TALIESIN: Thank you, I was just checking, because I could've just rolled really poorly. Ten.

MATT: Ten misses, unfortunately.

TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking another–

MATT: Oh, there's the Guiding Bolt, right? It's all right. Yeah, missed the Guiding Bolt, so you have advantage on that attack, I'm pretty sure.

TALIESIN: Oh, so I'm going to roll it again.

LIAM: Thank you, Pike.

ASHLEY: You're welcome!

MARISHA: Same fucking roll.

TALIESIN: I don't know what happened. Okay. Ten. So that–

MATT: So that one fires and now you're out of bullets.

TALIESIN: I know, so now I'm going to reload and fire again.

MATT: Okay, so your second and third attack. Go for it.

MARISHA: Oh my god!

TALIESIN: I have advantage though, right?

MATT: You have advantage. I think you do, hold on, let me see.

MARISHA: There we go, that's better.

MATT: Hold on, hold on. Next attack, no, it does not have advantage. So that misses as well, probably.

ASHLEY: War God's Blessing!

MATT: So! War God's Blessing?

ASHLEY: Yeah, it adds ten to his roll. Attack roll.

MATT: Okay, so it now becomes a 20.

TALIESIN: Oh.

SAM: What is War God's Blessing?

MATT: So War God's Blessing is one of her cleric abilities, since she chose the war domain after going to sea for a while. The specifics of it, just so you guys are aware of it, and why it's so useful–

ASHLEY: It's something I forget about a lot.

TALIESIN: Oh, yay!

MATT: She can basically, as a reaction, grant plus ten to an attack roll.

TALIESIN: Yeah, that hit, then. That hits.

MATT: So go ahead and roll damage now. So, as you're about to aim, Pike looks over and sees you about to take the shot and concentrates for a moment and the front of your barrel begins to glow with divine light as you fire. The bullet itself actually is white-hot as it leaves the barrel.

TALIESIN: This is such a confused gun.

MATT: I know.

TALIESIN: Okay. That's not bad. That's 20 plus five necrotic.

MATT: Okay. The impact of the divine enchanted bullet hits the current dark-energy-hexed individual and in the blast of light versus dark the upper torso of the thug is incinerated. It is ash. The waist below visible as it slumps over, no longer visible.

MARISHA: That was awesome!

TALIESIN: And I'm going to start walking my way towards Keyleth's special friend. Yeah, about there.

MATT: There? Okay.

TALIESIN: I'm not running. I'm walking.

MATT: All right. It's now their turn. The dwarf now moves over, goes, “Of course.” And begins taking all of its weapons and throws its mace down and puts its crossbow at your feet, spends its entire turn emptying its pouch and handing you what gold and gems and things it gathered.

LAURA: This is the best thing ever!

MATT: And giving you everything with a big dwarvish smile underneath its crusty beard.

SAM: Thank you. You're doing a good service.

TALIESIN: Make him shave.

LAURA: That is mean.

TALIESIN: I know!

MATT: This one's going to attack Keyleth. So, the one attacking Keyleth. This is the one attacking you, Keyleth.

MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

MATT: It saw you transform into Minxie. That's going to be, what's your AC?

MARISHA: As a tiger? Or no, I keep my AC, right? Or no, I take the tiger's AC.

MATT: It should be in your ability, your Wild Shape ability. I'm pretty sure you take it as the creature.

MARISHA: Then 11.

MATT: 11, that hits. Just making sure that's the case right now, real fast as we go over to this point.

MARISHA: I know I keep all of my brain stats, but I lose all my physical stats.

MATT: Correct. Yeah, you gain the AC of the creature as well.

MARISHA: Okay, so 11.

MATT: All right, so.

MARISHA: Oh no, wait, wait, wait, wait. 12.

MATT: 12 is the AC? First one misses, second one hits.

MARISHA: Oh, cool! Okay, cool.

MATT: It rolled 11 on the first attack. So, you do take 11 points of bludgeoning damage as the mace swings out and smacks into the side of your shoulder. You feel the impact, but it's nothing too harsh. There are two of them now that are trying to go against Grog, being the angry one that just bisected their ally. They have advantage on you because they are both pack tactics. The first attack is a 23.

TRAVIS: That hits.

MATT: Second one is a natural 20. Third attack, with advantage, is 15.

TRAVIS: Misses.

MATT: Misses. And the fourth and final one is a 17.

TRAVIS: Misses.

MATT: So a hit and a natural 20. Okay, so that is nine reduced to five against you. And then 12 reduced to six, so you take 11 points of bludgeoning damage between the two of them trying to beat on this furious angry goliath individual. And then there's one over here that's attacking Trinket now that's right in front.

LAURA: He just saw Trinket rip somebody else's face off.

MATT: Yeah, and in doing so swings out with a 13. I'm pretty sure misses Trinket's AC.

LAURA: Oh, yeah it does. He's got a better armor class than me.

MATT: He swings out, shaken by what it just saw happen to its friend and then takes that anger and turns around, rolling a 23, which I'm pretty sure hits. The mace slams into the side of Trinket's armor with a resounding (loud impact), the actual echo of the metal impact audible in the immediate vicinity, dealing a total of seven points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket.

LAURA: He's resistant to bludgeoning damage because of his armor.

MATT: Yep, so that would make it four. All right, that ends their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Okay. Really pissed off at this guy still. I'm going to concentrate and bring down a bolt of lightning in front of him, or behind–

MATT: Right there?

MARISHA: Yeah.

SAM: Dragons can see bolts of lightning.

MARISHA: It's also a cloudy day.

SAM: All right, all right, that makes sense.

MATT: Second bolt of lightning strikes the ground behind the guy in front of you. He rolled a 20, so he did make his save I'm pretty sure against you. Roll 4d10. He takes half-damage.

MARISHA: So, okay. Six, ten, 21 points, so ten?

MATT: Ten points of damage.

MARISHA: And then I'm going to do an attack on him. Grr.

MATT: Uh, you have to use your action to pull the bolt down, though?

MARISHA: I thought it was bonus.

MATT: It should say on the spell. I'll double-check.

MARISHA: I thought you could do that with Call Lightning.

MATT: Call Lightning, uh. On each of your turns, you can use your action to call it down, so yeah. A bolt is what you got.

MARISHA: Okay, that's fine.

MATT: Okay. However, the individual now is twice hit by lightning and is looking extremely rough and barely standing on his two feet. Is that your turn?

MARISHA: I can't do anything else, can I?

MATT: Okay, Garthok, you're up.

JASON: Garthok attacks the one attacking Trinket.

MATT: Okay.

JASON: And I can sneak attack, right?

MATT: Yeah, he's currently distracted between you and Trinket.

SAM: What are you going to do, what are you going to do?

MATT: Roll to hit first.

JASON: Oh yeah. I was so excited.

SAM: What if you miss?

LAURA: He won't miss.

JASON: 13.

MATT: 13 does hit.

(cheering)

TRAVIS: Skewer that piece of shit.

MARISHA: Nice! That's hot.

TRAVIS: Let the dice hit the floor.

JASON: 20.

MATT: 20 points. All right. So you take the spear and jam it into the abdomen of this looter here who, the sheer force of it from the strength as your muscles push in lifts him and slams him against the wall, you've partially pinned him against the stonework there. He reaches over and slams down on your hand repeatedly until eventually you withdraw and leave him back on his feet. He's looking rough, but he's definitely still holding his own. Is that–?

JASON: Can I use my cunning action with my hand crossbow or–?

MATT: Well, you can use a bonus action to fire with your hand crossbow at him if you want to.

JASON: Yeah.

MATT: All right. It's at disadvantage because you are in melee with him, so go ahead and roll twice and take the lower of the two.

LAURA: This will be sick, though, if he hit it.

SAM: Those are stinky dice.

JASON: 11. 11.

MATT: 11 just hits.

(cheering)

MATT: That's his AC. All right, so go ahead and roll damage with the hand crossbow. 1d6 plus whatever.

LAURA: Right in the face!

JASON: Six.

MATT: Six points of damage. As you pull the spear out, you reach to your side and over-the-arm pull the hand crossbow out and fire. It goes right into his left eye socket.

(cheering)

MATT: With that, you set the spear to the side and lock in the next bolt for your hand crossbow. Are you staying there?

JASON: Yeah.

MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: The poor bastard that's closest to you to my upper right, yeah, that little fuck's going to get Great Weapon Master relentless attacks.

MATT: (laughs) Okay, all three?

TRAVIS: All three.

MATT: Go for it.

TRAVIS: That is better. 14?

MATT: Hits.

TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll take that one.

LAURA: You could've been a 20, though, your next one could be a 20.

MATT: Yeah, roll again. You never know.

LAURA: It was a 20!

MARISHA: Shut up!

MATT: Which, as a note, at your level when you crit you do two additional dice on top of it. So you roll, double it, and then do two additional dice as one of your barbarian–

TRAVIS: I had one additional damage dice.

MATT: For this last level 13, you get two now.

TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.

SAM: This guy's going to be a puddle–

LAURA: Another natural 20!

SAM: Wait, does he get two more?

TRAVIS: On crits or kills, it's an extra hit.

MATT: Extra attack, okay. (laughs) Okay, so first, hold on, first roll damage for the first attack against this one.

TRAVIS: Me and the sword are vibing, man.

MATT: Right. Roll damage on the first one.

TRAVIS: Okay, yeah.

LIAM: You're playing jazz, man.

TRAVIS: 18, 28.

MATT: 28, which fails save, you get another plus one to your strength.

LAURA: Oh my god.

TRAVIS: Just the strength, right?

MATT: Exactly. Second attack, which is the critical. So, roll the dice, double that, add your modifier, and then add 2d12 to that.

TRAVIS: That's a lot of math. Roll another dice. That's a six–

LAURA: 2d12.

TRAVIS: 29, 40, 44?

SAM: What?

MATT: And failed the save again. That's another plus one to your strength.

TRAVIS: That goes up two.

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: That keeps happening?

MATT: So as you, the first two attacks, whoosh, cut off the right arm of that individual, and using that momentum, you bring it around and bisect him in the midsection. As that happens, you can see the blood turns from red to black as the blade drinks it up and you feel your muscles pulse with energy.

TRAVIS: Yes!

MATT: Just falls back on the ground.

LAURA: So now you can take the other guy, because you killed him.

TRAVIS: I critted on the third one.

MATT: The third one, I'll say because you killed him the third crit goes to the next guy, so go ahead and roll damage on that.

TRAVIS: 22, 32.

LIAM: He's gone.

MATT: Okay. And now you get your additional attack because of the Great Weapon Master.

LAURA: Oh my lord.

MATT: With advantage, because barbarians, man.

TRAVIS: 21?

MATT: Hits. When barbarians crit, man, things die. This is why relentless attack is so good with them. They take the penalty to their AC.

TRAVIS: 24 points.

MATT: 24 points of damage.

TRAVIS: Oh no, 34 points of damage because it's Great Weapon Master.

MATT: Failed save. All right. It made the last one, all right.

TRAVIS: Oh, plus two, 36 points.

MATT: So there you go. So you get another plus one to your strength. However, this time you take the blade and the first attack you jam it into their abdomen like this. As they're looking at you, grasping at your shoulders, your eyes completely covered in bloodlust, the foam at the corner of your mouth, you then put all of your strength at the bottom of it and completely cut upward, the body splitting in half as it falls to the ground.

(laughter)

LAURA: Oh my gosh.

TRAVIS: I've never been more happy in my life.

ASHLEY: Oh man, I'm coming back as a barbarian if I die.

MATT: All right, Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Oh, there's more people?

MATT: There's one guy over here by Keyleth who currently hasn't even noticed what's going on because he got hit with lightning twice and is being attacked by a giant tiger.

SAM: All right. I guess I'll try to intimidate him to stop, and I'll say, I'll turn to him and say, you there! Idiot! (stutters) You're not going to win! You should not fight anymore! Because you're going to die. And that's it, that's all I got.

MATT: Okay, roll intimidation check.

LAURA: Worst intimidation ever.

SAM: 22.

MATT: And yet the conviction behind the words– the heart behind each stuttered moment of that sentence–

SAM: You know what, I'll sing to him to intimidate him, would that help?

MATT: If you want to, go for it.

SAM: Sure. I will sing, (singing) Some people call me a gnome cowboy. Some people call me the gangster of love.

TALIESIN: Nobody calls him the gangster of love.

SAM: (singing) Some people call me Maurice because I'm a hitter, I'm a winner, I'm a bedroom shitter.

(laughter)

SAM: (singing) Playing my music on my shawm, oooh.

MATT: Which, right where the guitar would go (high-pitched guitar), you hear the clanging of weapons to the ground as the other remaining thug looks around and sees the mess that you've made of all of his various compadres and immediately drops to the ground, hand over his head, going: “I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!”

LAURA: We shouldn't have taken him hostage. I wanted to just kill him.

TRAVIS: Oh, don't worry.

JASON: We can still kill him.

SAM: And as my bonus action, I tell the dwarf to start collecting all the stuff from all the other people as well.

MATT: “Certainly. Right away.” See if he makes his save. He does not. So he then walks over and starts looting the corpses of his friends for you. (laughs)

TALIESIN: That's dark. That's dark.

MATT: All right, so there's the one guy who's on the ground now, hands over his head.

TRAVIS: Is he the only one left?

MATT: He's the only one left.

LAURA: And the dwarf who is looting things now.

MARISHA: I stay in Minxie form and stay on him, growling at him.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: I, actually, you know what? Instead of looting, I'm going to–

MATT: Slowly the rain begins to hit as the storm finally starts coming down, elevated by the druid spells that brought the moisture to gather over this section. You walk over to him.

LAURA: I'm actually going to start using perception to look for any sign of Gilmore in the rubble or–

SAM: Gilmore? Use your dragon perception, lady.

MATT: This would be more of an investigation check. As you begin to pore over the rubble yourself to gather it–

LAURA: Okay. I leave him to you all.

TRAVIS: Where's the meat?

LIAM: It was my turn in initiative, so I want to walk over to him.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Natural 20 on investigation.

MARISHA: Oh, that's going to be good. That's good.

MATT: All righty. So you walk over, so as she's investigating it, you go ahead and you walk over to him.

LIAM: You're coming with me. I lift him up and I'm leading him off around the corner of a building.

MARISHA: I pace along as Minxie.

MATT: Okay. Garthok, you doing anything?

JASON: I go with them.

MATT: Okay, so the half-orc saunters up next to the tiger and you guys disappear around the corner of one of the nearby buildings.

JASON: I just start cleaning my spear in front of him.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: I pace around.

MATT: All right, you lead him and you slam him up against the wall.

MATT: “Look, look, what do you want?”

LIAM: Nothing.

SAM: Oh, you knocking him out?

MATT: Whack, you take him off the side of the head and he crumples into a pile there in the alley.

LIAM: Pick up some shit from the ground and prop it up against him, a couple of pieces, not bury him, just hide him a bit.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: And then I walk back to the group and I start picking shit up around where my sister is.

MARISHA: I go back, I guess. I was useful.

JASON: I thought we were going to interrogate him.

MARISHA: Me, too. (laughs) I came along as intimidation.

LIAM: Looters?

MARISHA: But he was bringing stuff back and forth to–

LAURA: Well, he's still there. And we do have a dwarf that's mind-controlled right now. That is probably the best.

MATT: Who is currently looting the bodies.

LAURA: Don't touch anything. I'm investigating.

MATT: As you are going through the rubble, you can see a lot of the rubble has been moved over, and you see remnants of shattered glass cases and shelves and a lot of the things that you had previously seen within Gilmore's Glorious Goods, largely picked over and left behind. Many books lie tattered and burned and destroyed as part of the attack. You get the sense here that most anything that was of use or worth has been taken already and what the people here were gathering, they mentioned this was their third time back, they were basically picking up what remnants they could, which were pieces of broken objects, elements of gold that were left behind, but most of the contents of the store have been ransacked and taken.

SAM: Can I specifically look for the beaded curtain he emerges from?

MATT: Yes, actually. And as you guys go toward the beaded curtain, it's torn apart and under a big piece of rock. You push aside and, with the help of Grog and a few other individuals, you guys move some of the rocks out of the way to where the bedroom is, and it's completely destroyed. There's no sign of Gilmore or anybody else here, and as the rain's starting to come down a little heavier, you all get that sense of horror washing over you. Vex, you notice, looking underneath where the shattered remains of the foot of his bed are, there is a smooth piece of stone with a handle.

SAM: And a barrel of lube.

LAURA: I rush over to it.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Can I detect traps now?

MATT: I mean, you could technically detect traps whenever you wanted to try.

LAURA: Oh.

MATT: You have to have sight for it. If you want to, go ahead and make a perception check.

LAURA: 26.

MATT: 26. You take a moment to inspect it. You follow the edge, and yes, it is indeed a false door made of this stone tile that comprises the floor of the room, and it is a hatch. It is not trapped.

LAURA: I start pushing on the bed and call for Grog and say, help me with this!

TRAVIS: What? Oh! Run over. I help.

LAURA: There's a door.

LIAM: I hear her yelling and wander up as well.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: Still in Minxie, pace over.

MATT: The dwarf comes running up with you guys as well, still–

LAURA: Did he get everything? I mean, did he loot everything, are we–?

MATT: He comes up with all the various coin purses which, interestingly enough, are mostly empty other than a few copper. It seems like whatever they've stolen is not on them currently.

SAM: They gave it to the dragon.

LAURA: Assholes.

TRAVIS: They gave it to him.

LAURA: The dragon.

SAM: Him. Whatever that is.

TRAVIS: Did we ask?

SAM: No.

LIAM: You've got a happy dwarf standing–

SAM: Oi, dwarf.

MATT: “Aye.”

SAM: Who have you been collecting swag for?

MATT: “The dragon.”

SAM: Okay.

(laughter)

MATT: “As long as we give him what's important and what's worth, he'll keep us alive. Even protect us.”

SAM: He told you this?

ASHLEY: Where are you taking it to?

MATT: “To the center of town. Which I've never been before, the Cloudtop itself. What stands is very pretty.”

SAM: The gates to it are open?

MATT: “Aye.”

SAM: And the dragon sits there in the open, collecting his bounty?

MATT: “There's lines, folks lined up bringing all they have to him.”

JASON: So if this is your third trip back, the first two, you already took it to him or did you take it somewhere else to store?

MATT: “Well, we've put it all in a place so that then we can take it to him.”

JASON: Take us to that place.

MATT: “All right.” And he turns around and starts walking away.

JASON: Sorry.

SAM: No, that's fine.

MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, not yet!

LAURA: But wait, tell us where it is, how about that? How about you tell us where it is. Right now.

MATT: “Certainly.”

MATT: And he explains about a 15-minute walk from here there is a well that is in between four buildings in an alley cross-section. All of it's been actually put into the well, which has been hollowed out, or all the water's been repressed with dirt, and it's been filled with everything they've gathered.

LAURA: He's going to save eventually. He's going to break your mind control. Maybe we should knock him out right now.

TRAVIS: Knock him out, or–?

MATT: At which point, he turns around going, “Ugh.”

LAURA: Knock him out!

MATT: You know what, go ahead and roll an attack. It's going to be surprise because he currently is not aware of the situation, so it's auto-crit.

LIAM: Oh, advantage, all right. Well, that's better. 22.

MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll.

LIAM: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a 13, 16, that's still spinning, (counting), 26. 26 total.

MATT: Did you double that from the surprise? Because he wasn't even prepared.

LIAM: No, so, uh, okay, so–

MATT: It's enough, if you double it. As long as you're over 40, he's down.

LIAM: Yeah, it would be 40-something.

MATT: Yeah, so. He goes out. A little dwarven pile. He's out.

LAURA: Tie him up. I don't want him waking up and running back to the dragon.

TRAVIS: You know how you solve that?

LAURA: I understand that, Grog. Maybe we should just tie him up.

SAM: Tie him up.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Tie him up and tie him up to a big stone so he can't get up and run even if he–

MATT: Okay, so you guys take a moment to go ahead and–

TALIESIN: Bow. Tie him in a little bow.

MATT: Little bow, little dwarven bow? Okay. You find a large piece of broken stone that was part of the building's base floor structure and you tie it around in multiple ways where he's going to have a hard time getting out, especially in his current mindspace when he comes to consciousness. The rain's still pouring down. He's soaked.

LAURA: Now.

MATT: All right. You guys gather around the hidden hatch in the floor of Gilmore's room, and we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break.

ALL: Oh!

MATT: (laughs) A quick one. We'll take a few minutes, get right back into this because we do have Critmas tonight. We want to make sure we get as much done before we have to leave. So let's do this. See you guys in a minute.
Break

[break]
Part II

MATT: Welcome back everyone! So, as Liam here brings up our wondrous Pike, we'll go ahead and hop back into the game in just a minute, but I did want to say two things. One, we have this evening's winner for our giveaway, so a big congratulations to one of my favorite recent chatroom names: congrats to JarFullOfFarts.

(laughter)

MATT: You are our giveaway winner. I love you, Internet, for allowing me to say these sentences. It's a wonderful experience.

TRAVIS: Jar full of farts!

MATT: Also, I want to give a shout-out to a friend of the show who's been helping stream on their end as well, hosting us on their channel, and we've had a good back-and-forth. “Rated E with Elspeth” has been a really awesome supporter of the show. Go check her out, give her a follow if you have the opportunity. Thank you very much, by the way, for helping support us. So, yay! All right, so! Getting back in here. As the rain now continues to pour down from above the open, clouded sky of Emon, you reach down and pull open the false latch on top of this open, hidden compartment beneath the remnants of Gilmore's room. You look down into a dark, low-lit interior, and what appears to be a figure who rushes up very, very quickly and stops. And you hear a voice from within the darkness, just out of view from your position, that says, “Whoever you are, leave! Run away or I swear I'll kill you!”

MARISHA: Sherri.

LAURA: Sherri?

MATT: You look down and it doesn't appear to be Sherri. It's a woman, frazzled hair. You can't make out the details of her expression, but she's holding this blade in front.

LAURA: Don't attack!

SAM: Sherri, it's us!

LAURA: Did you work here? We're looking for Gilmore.

MATT: Looks past her shoulder. “Sherri?”

MATT: And you see Sherri now approaches, her hair frazzled. She looks like she's covered in soot, and actually has suffered some minor burns on part of her arm and the side of her face a little bit, and she steps into the little bit of light at the bottom of the shaft and looks up and goes, “My god. Come in, quick. Please.” And she ushers you down into this area.

MARISHA: I drop Minxie form.

MATT: Okay. As you guys all head down inside, this is a relatively small chamber, maybe 20 feet by 20 feet. There's a couple of small chairs, and there are a few metal rods that are bolted into the stonework leading down as a ladder that you can climb down. This is obviously a hidden compartment that Gilmore uses to go up and down. You get a better view now. It is Sherri there. Trinket, unfortunately, at this moment, cannot make his way down into this, so looks at you (bear grunts). Looks around–

LAURA: Stay and guard the unconscious fucks.

MATT: (bear grunts) and sets into a defensive position now looking out at the rest.

LAURA: If they start to wake up, sit on them! Or kill them, if necessary.

MATT: Gives a nod, and stands there in the pouring rain, soaking through Trinket. The armor ting-ting-ting-ting-ting, ting-ing off the armor. Staying there, keeping guard. As you all climb down, you notice next to Sherri a very frazzled and harrowed-looking– the woman who was holding the dagger in front. Her clothing is very, very nice, though currently torn, and filthy. This is Empress Salda Tal'Dorei.

TRAVIS: Oh shit.

SAM: Wait, what, who?

MATT: Empress Salda Tal'Dorei, the wife of Uriel.

LAURA: Empress! Is Uriel down here? Did you make it out? The children!

MATT: She puts her blade away. She looks over her shoulder. “The children–” She puts her hand to the side and you can see in the back room, which, now you can see, there is a teleportation circle that is slowly lit on the bottom of the floor within this room.

MARISHA: What was her first name again? Empress what?

MATT: Salda.

MARISHA: Esalda? With an E?

MATT: Salda. S-A-L-D-A. She looks over and you can see her three kids, Odessa, Illya, and Gren, two daughters and son, are all sitting in the corner, talking to each other. They look like how children deal in these type of situations. They're talking and playing games and trying to distract themselves. But as soon as you guys all walk in, they look over, quietly, and their faces brighten up at the arrival of somebody new, and they recognize you as you begin to step into the low light of the chamber. Salda then puts her hand down and says, “I don't believe my husband made it. But we're alive.”

LIAM: Did you see him fall?

MATT: “No.” And she looks over into the far corner. You can see, amongst the pile of rags and stuff, there is one long pile of dark, crushed velvet blue in the corner, with a small puddle of crimson under it. “He saved us.” And, glancing over in the corner, you can now see the shape of Gilmore, slumped in the corner, arm draped over his midsection, head down to the side, in the center of that pool.

LIAM: I run over, I run over. Is he awake? Is he alive? I've got my hand under his chin. Is he alive?

MATT: You reach over and touch Gilmore's face, and it is cold with sweat, but it's feverish sweat. There is a very, very strong fever in his body, and there's beads of sweat down the face, and as you look down you can see where the arm is holding there is blood soaked into the robe. You can see parts of the robe right now are currently– elements of it are burned and charred. You can see parts of it scraped away. Gilmore's looking pretty rough.

LIAM: I pull him in. Pike, Pike, Pike! Keyleth! Come over here!

MATT: Pike, what are you doing?

ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Cure Wounds.

LIAM: It's going to be all right. Pike is here, it's going to be all right, it's going to be all right. Gil? Is there any consciousness?

MARISHA: I mean, I can try and assist you, Pike, with Cure Wounds. That's all I have right now.

ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, is he conscious?

MATT: No, unconscious. Unconscious, and looking–

MARISHA: Fading fast?

LAURA: Can you, like, Greater Restoration? I mean, what's the best cure you can do, Pike?

ASHLEY: Okay okay okay.

MATT: You guys can both make medicine checks to try and put him in a position where he would be more susceptible to healing.

LAURA: 22?

ASHLEY: I can use a sixth level, and Heal.

MATT: Use the spell Heal?

ASHLEY: Yeah.

MARISHA: And I did a 16 on my Medicine check, with her 22.

MATT: Okay. So you guys take a moment, you dress the wounds best you can, and put him in a position where Pike, as you bring forward, you grab your holy symbol, and clutching it between both your hands very tightly, you kneel down in front of the slowly fading body of Gilmore. You can see the shiver occasionally, instinctually in his unconsciousness, and you reach out and touch him, and as you do, the warm light of Sarenrae fills your torso, travels through your arms, and into the body of Gilmore. His arms fall to his side, limp, as the warmth swells up into the torso, and for a second, as the outside of the robe that you saw torn open opens up, you can see now the hideous gash that has currently torn through his abdomen. As the warmth spreads through the body, and the light visually shows the horrible, jagged nature of this wound, the wound stitches itself up and you can see it close, leaving but the tiniest of scar across. The blood itself all still caked into the material, but the wound is now closed. As you pull your hands back, you can see Gilmore's body, which has, from the sheer power of the Heal spell, has actually been elevated a few inches off the ground, and then clatters to the ground as the spell finishes, and you can see he shivers for a second, he curls over. (pained grunt)

LIAM: I pull him into my lap, and hold onto him.

MATT: At this point, Sherri instinctively goes, “Is he all right? Is he all right?” She pulls out her glasses, puts them on.

LIAM: I think so, I think so.

MATT: “Who's this one? What is he doing here?”

SAM: He's a friend, he fought with us. He's not corrupted by the dragon's influence.

MATT: “I'd like to know your name, orcish sir.”

SAM: It's really cool.

JASON: I'm Garthok. I bow. I bow.

MATT: She gives you a sideways glance. “Keep your distance. I don't trust you yet.” And she turns back around towards Gilmore. As you're holding him there, the children at this point are very quiet and sitting at his foot as you all gather around this corner. A minute passes in silence. Another minute passes.

LIAM: Smoothing his hair out. Hey. Hey.

MATT: His body is– the stillness is maintained, but you can still feel the heartbeat, and you can feel the pulse of blood through the body from holding the shoulders. And then, from that silence, you hear, (weak coughing). And the mouth opens, and the eyes begin to loll open, and the irises begin to try and find some point of focus, and Gilmore slowly lolls the head back up and looks into your face and smiles, instinctually, little blood at the corner of his mouth, and he looks up at you. “Well. That's always what I assumed I'd see in my last moments.” (chuckles)

LIAM: Bad day, huh?

MATT: “Ah… strangely enough, I'm pretty sure I've had worse.”

LAURA: No offense, darling, but you look like shit.

MATT: (laughs) “We can't have that, can we?” (coughs) Lifts his hand and begins to try and cast a spell. You can see a bit of arcane Prestidigitation begin to try and muster, and he coughs, and the magic sputters and fades.

LIAM: Give it time.

MATT: “So, either we're all dead or we're all alive. I'd like an answer.”

LAURA: Alive.

MATT: “Good, I was hoping you'd say that. (relieved chuckle) I was so worried about you all. I went back for you.”

MARISHA: What? We were so worried about you!

TALIESIN: We're glad you came here.

MATT: “I'm sorry. When they attacked, my instinct was to grab the children. I got who I could, but Uriel pushed me away. He was trying to get others out of the fray.”

LAURA: Did you see him fall?

MATT: “I didn't see him fall, but I went back, and I found him fallen.”

SAM: His body?

MATT: “What was left of it. I brought back Salda and the children. I brought back Asum, and that abrasive dragon girl. I don't know where they are right now.” And Salda chimes in and goes, “They both actually, they left. They went topsoil to try and find other survivors. I told them not to, I told them to stay, but they're assumedly off in the city somewhere, trying to make sense of all this.”

TALIESIN: We're trying to collect people at our keep.

MARISHA: We've turned it into a safe haven.

MATT: “Well. That's kind of you. That's good of you. That's probably one of the only safe places in the city right now.” (coughs)

LIAM: Can you do anything?

LAURA: I mean, I can cast Cure Wounds on him to try to help out at all. Will it help? I mean, you know, more than I would.

MATT: “Whatever your fine angel of Sarenrae did I think will hold me fine for now.” And he smiles and gives a very, very half-hearted wink towards Pike. “Thank you.”

ASHLEY: Welcome.

MATT: “Thank you dearly.”

LIAM: You've certainly earned your name today.

MATT: “I could have saved more. I couldn't find you, I couldn't– I looked.”

MARISHA: We're so sorry.

MATT: “Oh, no, I, you– ”

TALIESIN: We were hard to find.

MATT: “I figured you would be taking care of yourself. I went– (chuckles) I went to the dragon then, just in case you had decided to be your usual foolish selves and run into hell itself.”

LAURA: Perhaps sent a spy and try to trick him? (chuckles) That would have been stupid, huh?

SAM: Yes. Very.

LAURA: Gilmore, we called for you. I'm sorry we didn't wait.

MATT: “No. I'm glad you didn't. You may not be here.”

LIAM: Did you see any others from the Council? Anyone else?

MATT: “Well.” And he leans forward, and sits up out of your lap for a second to look at the rest of you. “There are quite a few dead, unfortunately. Brom Goldhand didn't make it. Most of the guards are gone. Half, if not more, of the Cloudtop District. Killed by the poisonous fume that took the entire area so suddenly.”

LAURA: Poisonous fume?

MATT: “From the initial dragon attack. We've been staying here for safety's sake. I don't know how long I've been out. Could we perhaps make our way towards your place as well?”

LAURA: It would be smart.

SAM: Is there any point to searching for more Council members or allies before we go?

LAURA: Anyone that was alive that you saw?

MATT: “I mean, there were many that were alive by the time I returned. They were all kneeling before the beast. It's very interesting that when given the face of death before you how quickly folks are willing to stay alive at whatever cost of morality and sense of society. I don't blame them. I mean, what other alternative is there, but to stay alive and hope that others come and save them from this burden?” (coughs) And he coughs up a little blood and wipes it from his chin.

LAURA: Does the Cinder King have mind control abilities, or is he just super impressive?

MATT: “I think it's more that he's very persuasive with his threat of how many did not fare this attack. I did get a good look at him, before he– well.”

LIAM: He's ripped the heart out of this city. Let's go.

MARISHA: Everything's gone.

SAM: When you saw him, did you see anything important?

MATT: “I did notice in his chest, where the scales of a dragon usually are uniform, there was an obfuscation of sorts, there was something different about his armor. It was hard to make out the details in how fast we had a duel. I've never dueled a dragon before! I've dueled a dragon now.”

(laughs)

LAURA: And fared quite well!

MATT: “No, I did not! I survived longer than I hoped, and got out when I could.”

JASON: A weak spot.

SAM: Yeah, did it look like scarring? From a previous fight?

MATT: “I didn't get a very good look, but it looked like there was a different material, something smooth and jagged. Something that pulsed with power.”

LIAM: Doesn't sound like a weak spot.

LAURA: That doesn't sound super good.

MATT: “I didn't get a terribly good look, nor do I understand the nature of whatever it was, but–”

TALIESIN: It's the beginning of something. Something to start thinking about.

MARISHA: What do you mean?

MATT: “Does anyone have any water? I'm a bit parched.”

TRAVIS: We got better than that, we got a potion. And honestly, if we're going to be moving about on the streets, I'd like you to not fall open like a can of baked beans, if you don't mind.

MATT: (chuckles) “I'm not going to lie, I'm quite touched by your concern, Grog. It's flattering.” (grunts) And he starts trying to stand up, and as he does, Sherri rushes forward and grabs him.

LIAM: I'm under, too, I'm helping him up.

MATT: You get him up, and he's propping himself up. What little strength he has, he's keeping himself up, and keeping a smile through it all. Even in this weakened state, still trying to present the best of himself that he can. “All right.”

SAM: Gilmore, before we go, one more crazy question: you're not a dragon, are you?

MATT: (laughs) “Oh, I wish I was. That would have made this whole endeavor a little easier on my part.”

SAM: All right.

MATT: “But if you find a way for me to become a dragon, that would be sexy.”

(laughter)

ASHLEY: Oh, Gilmore.

SAM: Should we teleport, or is there tunnels, or how do we go?

LAURA: Could I have just a little bit of time? Before we–

SAM: Oh, with Garthok? Or with Gilmore?

LAURA: Oh, up top. You know, I'll be right back.

SAM: You're going to go up there?

LAURA: Just for a second.

TRAVIS: All by yourself?

LAURA: I mean, if you guys want to join, if anybody wants to come with me, but I'm going to stealth like a motherfucker.

MARISHA: I mean, it seemed like we were heading out? Are we heading out?

TALIESIN: I propose a plan. Let's get them back to the secret passage. I think we should–

[no audio]

TALIESIN: One of the reasons why a government allows something like the Clasp to exist in a city like this is because it is a shadow infrastructure that will survive an attack like this. It is an infrastructure designed– Grog, it's a bunch of people who are really good at making money when everything's working, and when everything stops working, they get very angry and want to make everything work again.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I understand that.

TALIESIN: So we have a group of people who are well-organized, with everything to gain by this dragon leaving. They're ready, they're prepared, they're probably more prepared than anybody else would be. And they might be willing to help us. They have tunnels, they have men, they have spies, they have everything we need. Please tell me if I'm wrong here.

JASON: You couldn't be more right.

TALIESIN: They might be the friends that we need at this moment.

MATT: “I take it you're one of these underlings?”

JASON: I can't speak for the group, but I am a member, yes.

LAURA: Would they listen to you?

JASON: I'm sure they would.

LAURA: They don't like us very much.

JASON: A lot of us didn't like Mordeth either, so more people like you than you may know.

LAURA: All right.

TRAVIS: Where do you want to go?

LAURA: I want to go get that fucking well full of fucking loot. Magical items, gold, who knows what could be in there that could help us?

MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, you want to go steal from Thordak?

LAURA: No no no! They never gave it to him. They gathered a bunch of shit and they hid it in a well.

SAM: Because he told them to.

LAURA: No, they were going to get it all together and give it to him, but they never gave it to him.

TRAVIS: They were keeping it. They were hiding it away in one place.

TALIESIN: So, a small group goes and gets the gold and the rest of us get Gilmore and the family to the secret passage.

SAM: Last time we took a dragon's gold, five of them showed up.

LAURA: The dragon doesn't know about the gold.

SAM: Don't you think the dragon knows everything that's going on right now? I'm the spy here.

LAURA: If you're scared, then go with Gilmore. I'm going to go get the gold.

TALIESIN: I would agree with getting the gold.

LAURA: Grog?

TRAVIS: I'll go with the family.

LAURA: Gimme the Bag of Holding, then. Where am I going to put all the gold?

TALIESIN: She's got a point.

MARISHA: Do you all remember the last time I told you something was a terrible idea?

LAURA: I've got the Bag of Holding.

MARISHA: It was a few days ago–

SAM: It was every time.

TRAVIS: Yeah, it's all the time, really.

MARISHA: Right, right. This is probably another one of those times.

LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on myself and anybody else joining me?

SAM: I'm coming too.

LAURA: Scanlan.

TRAVIS: Vax?

TALIESIN: I'll come– wait, no, I should probably go.

LIAM: I don't want to go, but I'm not leaving you. And I hoist Gilmore onto Keyleth.

MATT: “Ah.”

TALIESIN: We've got you.

MATT: “Hello.” (chuckles)

MARISHA: Vax.

LIAM: I'm not happy.

LAURA: Well, then, don't be pissy about it.

LIAM: I'm not leaving you.

LAURA: We'll be right back. I mean, it's magic shit! Gilmore, I'm going to get your shit back for you.

MARISHA: Remember the last time we went somewhere to go get a big pile of shit?

MATT: “Good thing, because, well. I'm going to need it to renovate this place a little.” (laughs, coughs)

LAURA: Right?

TRAVIS: He's a fan of it.

LAURA: Pass Without a Trace on the three of us. Stealth like a motherfucker.

SAM: Who's three? Us three?

LAURA: Yeah. Us three. Stealth out. It's like a 15-minute walk.

MARISHA: We were flanked here at Gilmore's Goods. What makes you think that they're not going to have a ton of people sitting there watching that well?

LAURA: I'm going to look out for that shit this time.

MARISHA: Yeah, that, right. That's worked well in the past.

JASON: The area where they're going, where the well is. Is that closer to one of the entrances to the Clasp?

MATT: The one you're going towards? In the direction. It's a little bit past where you're going so you'd have to double back to the entrance, but it is totally a way to do it.

LAURA: Look, see?

SAM: Then we're all going to the same place.

LAURA: See? Look at this. I'm going to stay separate from the group so I can stealth a little bit better.

TRAVIS: Twins out in front.

LAURA: I'm stealthing. Pass Without a Trace on all of us, then.

MATT: Stealth checks from all those that are heading towards the well.

LAURA: Are we all heading towards the well to jump down to the Clasp, or is anybody going back towards the Keep right now?

JASON: The well's farther or the Clasp entrance is farther?

MATT: The Clasp entrance is closer, the well is further, so you actually go past it.

MARISHA: Hang on, hang on. Hang on. We're all going to the Clasp entrance?

MATT: That's up to you guys.

MARISHA: Which is in the same direction as our keep? Because we have a crippled guy on our shoulder.

TALIESIN: Yeah, we wanted to get the family and Gilmore back to the keep first.

LAURA: And the kids. Get them back to the keep.

SAM: Can't you tree-shoot us, tree-shoot them there?

MARISHA: I don't want to use that in case we need to tree-shoot us to Vasselheim. Or somewhere.

TALIESIN: Let's hold that off.

TRAVIS: We're going to the Clasp entrance, right, to go to the tunnels and all the network of shit that we don't understand because they'll be allies and the people that are going to stealth ahead are going to go to the well?

LAURA: I don't think we should bring three children into the Clasp.

TALIESIN: This was my thought, is we take everybody who's down here, we get them back to the castle. In the meantime–

SAM: Which castle? The keep?

TALIESIN: Keep. In the meantime, you get the treasure. Once the treasure is gotten and they're back in the keep, we get together and find the Clasp.

LAURA: Perfect plan! Let's go.

MARISHA: I grab Vax's hand and pull him back as they pace away.

MATT: Okay. So, as you guys all find your way outside of the remnants of Gilmore's facility, the three children and Salda staying very close. She keeps the children like right at her sides with her arms around them, protectively. Sherri's at her side as well with her blade out just in case, and they're forming this circle around the remnants of the Tal'Dorei family. As those of you continue to push forward, before you disappear, Keyleth grabs and pulls you.

LIAM: Splitting off?

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: I have to go.

MARISHA: What? Don't, wait! Vax, Vax, listen to me.

LIAM: I pull away and go.

MARISHA: No, Vax! God fuckin', you–

MATT: As Vax quite literally disappears from your sight after a few steps, vanishing into the shadow of the rubble.

MARISHA: I go through to my earring. Vax, talk her out of it. This is not the time to be looting for treasure. That's only ever brought us grief. Talk her out of it.

LAURA: 29, 39 on stealth for me.

MATT: (laughs) Okay.

SAM: 28.

LAURA: Plus ten?

MARISHA: Who's taking the kids home?

LAURA: Trinket's going with you guys, by the way.

LIAM: 42.

MARISHA: You're coming with us?

TRAVIS: I'm going, yeah, with the kids.

MARISHA: With the kids? I'll cast Pass Without a Trace on us. On team back-to-the-keep.

MATT: Okay. I'll have you guys roll a stealth check as well. Okay. And you're heading with them to the–

JASON: So, well. In what direction is the keep, because–

MATT: The keep is southward. It's away from the entrance to the Clasp.

JASON: Garthok's dilemma is his first priority is trying to–

SAM: Garthok's Dilemma is a great book.

(laughter)

LAURA: Do what you got to do, Garthok.

JASON: Garthok's dilemma is his–

TRAVIS: Don't tell us, just do it!

JASON: He's got to go towards the Clasp because he's trying to make sure they're still alive.

MATT: As you guys divide, Garthok still stands there for a second looking back and forth, conflicted by this. Vex, you pick up on this as you're walking away.

LAURA: What're you doing?

JASON: I have to go, I have to find the Clasp. It's my number one priority. It's why I sought you guys out in the first place.

MARISHA: We understand. We've got the kids.

JASON: I'll meet you at the Clasp entrance.

LAURA: Where do you want us to meet you?

SAM: Can you tell us where the entrance is? Do we know where the entrance is?

LAURA: Which entrance?

JASON: The entrance that I know exists is in the same direction as the treasure, so I will travel with you until we get to the entrance, which hopefully is there and not destroyed.

LAURA: Better fucking stealth like a motherfucker.

JASON: Ready. 14.

MATT: Plus ten. 24 for stealth.

MARISHA: Are we all rolling stealth?

MATT: Yeah. Everyone is. Plus ten.

TRAVIS: 27.

SAM: Pike!

ASHLEY: Yup. I rolled a 16.

LAURA: Yeah, 26 stealth, Pike!

ASHLEY: That was at disadvantage, too.

MATT: Nice. Well-played.

MARISHA: 25.

TALIESIN: 31.

MATT: All right. So as you guys split off in the rain, occasionally you hear the slam of something heavy echoing in the distance from the Cloudtop and a guttural yell of frustration.

LAURA: I'm keeping my eye out for any kind of anything in front of us.

MATT: Right. You're not sure what or why anything's happening, but twice during your journey northward for this, you hear a low growl or roar and there's a flash of fire from over the wall. You don't know what happened. As you guys push, darting through the alleys, for the team that's going for the entrance to the Clasp, you lead them into–

JASON: A trap! Booyah!

(laughter)

LAURA: You motherfucker!

MATT: That would've been amazing.

JASON: I've been waiting to trap you for three hours!

MATT: You lead them into a wine cellar that is locked over with a series of chains. You go forward and you know where there are two triggers for two traps that are part of that entrance. You go ahead and deftly disable both traps through hidden mechanisms. You go ahead and pull on one of the chains and it extends magically as you pull on it, almost infinite, or at least for a period of time. You find the right link, you activate it, keeping this all hidden to yourself, because this is what you're trained to do, and the chain disables itself or breaks into three different pieces. You then open up the two parts of this cellar, lead them down into a regular wine cellar. It's very dark. There's almost no light down there other than what's pouring in through this entrance. It looks like most of the wine bottles here have been taken out. It's empty other than a few small bottles that are set up in this vast criss-cross of wooden racks, and you go ahead and walk over to one of the barrels and lift up the top of a heavy, heavy whiskey barrel. Pulling off the top of the barrel, the barrel itself does not move as he's wrestling with it. As he does, he climbs into and stops for a second, looks around, and shows you guys that this barrel itself is actually a chute ladder that leads downward into a subterranean base.

LAURA: Got it. Now is all that shit up top going to be open for us when we come back?

JASON: I could wait for you here or maybe come with you and get some of that treasure.

LAURA: It's going to be a while, you know. We've got to get the treasure and go back to the Keep and come back–

SAM: You can come with us. You can come with us.

LAURA: I mean, it's up to you. I know you need to talk to the Clasp, so if you need to talk to them and let them know we're on our way–

SAM: Enough treasure to go around.

JASON: I could definitely let them know.

LAURA: It's up to you.

JASON: I'm relieved that it's there and not destroyed, so.

MATT: Okay. So, you guys, now knowing where the entrance is, you make your way back out. You close the cellar and make your way towards where this dwarf's general description of the well is. I want you to make an investigation check.

SAM: All of us?

MATT: All of you.

SAM: 27.

TRAVIS: Natural 20.

LAURA: You're not with us.

TRAVIS: Oh, I thought he said everybody.

MATT: Sorry, everybody in that group. But congratulations!

MARISHA: Oh no!

TRAVIS: I escort the kids expertly. I'm a champ at babysitting.

MATT: You've had a Percy game today. You've had a lot of twenties.

LAURA: 19.

ASHLEY: 20.

JASON: 14.

LIAM: 11.

MATT: 11. So you guys take about 20 minutes, wandering the area unable to find really which destination this is, partially because a lot of the sections here are partially destroyed or at least are unfamiliar to you. You've not spent a lot of time in this northern area of Emon. Scanlan, you dart off for a second, seeing a similar crossroads between alleys, and you find a well that very much appears to be, and you know it's yours because there's a number of copper and gold coins that are scattered around the base of the well.

SAM: This is it. Traps?

LAURA: I look around. Can I perceive anything or any people around, anything?

MATT: Make a perception check.

LAURA: Natural 20.

MATT: All right. You– damn, guys. You glance about and nobody is here. Other than the sound of the rain that is still smashing down from outside, there doesn't appear to be any individual within visual range right now.

SAM: Vex, can you scan for dragons, please?

LIAM: I rolled a 22 for traps.

MATT: Okay. No traps from what you can tell. As you look over the edge of the well, you can see where the dirt has been packed in and given a false, or a somewhat muddy bottom to the well, which once held water. And around the edges you can see where there are a couple of discarded shovels thrown to the side, and chunks of the earth that have been shoved in there to give it some sort of bottom. You also see there's maybe about 20, 30 or so haphazard coins in the bottom. Empty.

SAM: He got it already.

LAURA: Dicks! Dicks.

SAM: Talking about dragons?

LAURA: No, whoever the fuck came and took all the fucking gold.

SAM: The dragons came and got it.

MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I think.

LAURA: Can I take one of the shovels and move some of the dirt to see if maybe it's deeper than it looks?

MATT: Okay. You go ahead and move some of the dirt, and you find a couple more coins, a total of 35 gold it would be, really, that you get from it.

LAURA: What a waste.

SAM: Can we see, can I see any signs of dragon claws or dragon slobber or anything?

MATT: (laughs) There are none around you, and you gather from the sheer immensity that is the Cinder King that if he were to come down here and retrieve this gold himself, most of the adjacent buildings and the well would be ruined.

SAM: So people put a bunch of gold there then someone else came and took it?

JASON: Well, allegedly a bunch of gold. Maybe that's all they found.

SAM: It's your fucking people from the Clasp, isn't it?

JASON: No!

LAURA: Can I use tracking to see if it looks like anybody's been here?

MATT: Sure. Make a wisdom survival check.

LAURA: 19.

MATT: 19. There are a number of footprints, actually. Relatively recent, that all–

LAURA: Is that 17 or 11? That's 11. Okay, yeah.

MATT: Yeah, okay. So looking about, you see the tracks pushing northward. There's about four fresh sets of prints, fresher than the others you see around it. The trail of coins that follow that for about ten, 15 feet, you can tell that they were taken in haste. You gather by the way it's set up that perhaps somebody else had found this cache before you did.

LAURA: I never thought, when we came back up out of the fucking trap door, were the people still unconscious?

MATT: Yeah, they were still unconscious.

LAURA: Oh, okay.

SAM: Let's follow the tracks. They're fresh.

LIAM: Are we really going to scrabble about in the mud for coin today?

SAM: Well, we've come this far.

LIAM: Scanlan.

SAM: I'm very easily swayed.

(laughter)

JASON: What a great leader.

LIAM: We should go back to the Keep.

SAM: You're right, you're right.

LIAM: This is a waste of our time.

SAM: But if Vex could somehow convince us–

(laughter)

SAM: I'd be open to it.

LAURA: Look, the reason I wanted to come get all of this gold is because I thought there could be a lot of Gilmore's magical items that were probably put in here. People don't realize what they have. I thought it could help us a lot.

LIAM: I understand, and it was not a bad idea, but this place has been cleared out, let's–

LAURA: But what if it's just one or two people that came and stole everything and we could totally take them.

SAM: And they're like 100 yards away.

LAURA: And they're like right up the alley. Like right there. Can I stealth ahead a little bit and see?

MATT: Okay. You stealth ahead, and at this point, you follow the tracks that go to the road, and they're following the alleys as well, you can see from the way they're–

LIAM: Wait wait wait. I'm sorry, one second. You know, you're very charming, but you're a fucking weirdo. And I climb up after my sister stealthily and follow.

MATT: Okay. All right.

SAM: I just shrug. I think he was talking to you.

(laughter)

MATT: Okay, and what do you two do?

JASON: I'm going back to my trap door.

MATT: Okay. So Garthok, you step away from the group and head back to the Clasp.

JASON: Thank you for–

SAM: It's been a great day killing with you. I hope our paths cross again, perhaps in the catacombs.

JASON: I will let the Clasp know that you're coming.

SAM: Tell them whenever they see Scanlan Shorthalt to open the door. They stealthed, so I don't know where they went, do I?

MATT: Roll a perception check.

LIAM: I got a natural 20 on my stealth.

SAM: Got a nine on perception.

MATT: You have no clue.

SAM: Can I look at the tracks? I can't read tracks.

MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom survival check, just for the hell of it.

SAM: Three.

MATT: Three? Okay. You begin following a set of tracks that you think is pretty close to theirs. Pike, you're with everyone else bringing the rest of them back to the keep. You're with the other half of the group.

TRAVIS: You're with me, Pike.

MARISHA: We're babysitting.

MATT: You guys are babysitting the family and Gilmore, getting him back to the keep.

ASHLEY: Oh. Wait, why did I stealth check?

MATT: To stealth with them to get out of the city, and we'll get to you guys in just a minute.

ASHLEY: Oh, I thought I was going with them.

SAM: Do I even know how to get home from here?

MATT: Based on that check? You get really discombobulated in the center of the rainy midday of Emon.

LAURA: I said I was going to be right back, Scanlan!

LIAM: A hand shoots out of the darkness and grabs Scanlan by the nose and tugs him off.

MATT: Okay. All right. You guys continue on, and following the tracks a little bit, they lead westward and curve down a few more alleys, heading towards the north entrance to the Cloudtop.

LAURA: Ah, shit. Fuck it. They're taking it to the fucking dragon. Dicks.

MATT: Do you continue to follow or do you head back?

LAURA: No, we'll fucking go back.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Will you tell me how to get back?

LAURA: Hey.

LIAM: Could you say that again with your nose pinched?

SAM: Will you tell me how to get back?

(laughter)

LAURA: We'll get back. What happened to– where's Gorthok?

SAM: Garthok.

LAURA: Garthok. Where is he?

SAM: Garthok told me he was going back to his Clasp entrance. Our paths will cross again. He also said that you were kind of weird.

LAURA: Oh, well. I am. I start walking back to the keep.

MATT: Okay, you guys make your way back. The rest of you make your way further south, retracing the path you took here since you already know what's there. You do reach a certain point where as you push down one of the alleys, a few individuals come out, blades at the ready and, “Hey! Drop your stuff. Give us what you've go–” And then, at which–

MARISHA: Boof!

MATT: (laughs) At which point, Keyleth socks one in the jaw as Sherri pulls out a wand and blasts one of the nearby pieces of stone off the wall with a bolt of lightning.

MARISHA: Not today.

MATT: Gilmore, who steps onto his feet and carries his weight for a second raises his hands up, and as he does you can see arcane bolts whipping around him in this almost molecule-like electron pattern as he goes, “Do you gentlemen seriously wish to start this ruckus?”

SAM: Yeah!

MATT: They all go, “No.” And they slowly back away and then dart around the corner as fast as they can. You hear their feet spattering against the mud.

MARISHA: Keyleth goes, yeah, you better run!

TRAVIS: Way to tell them, Kiki.

MATT: As Gilmore lowers his hands, he begins to fall forward.

TALIESIN: And we grab him.

MATT: Grab him, catch him, and he's like, (breathing hard). “That's, that's the last of me. That's all I've got. Take me home. Please.”

MARISHA: We're almost home. Almost home.

MATT: Pinches your cheek, Grog.

TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

(laughter)

MATT: You guys continue to the path. As you make your way through the groups of the dead that you passed before, a lot of them have since been taken off the street and you can see now graves are being dug right outside of the gate as you find the south gate. Do you want to walk through the fields or do you want to use the same path you took into the secret path into the Keep?

TRAVIS: I think the fields would be my vote.

LAURA: What?

MATT: You're not there.

TALIESIN: No one's noticing us at this point. There's too much going on.

TRAVIS: Oh. Out of the city is I think the safest way.

MARISHA: Why wouldn't we take the secret passage? It's here, right? No?

MATT: As soon as you say secret passage, Gren, the little boy, is like, “Did you say secret passage?”

MARISHA: I did! I did!

MATT: Comes up and like, “I've never seen a secret passage before.”

MARISHA: Do you want to go see it?

MATT: “Can we see the secret passage?” The kids seem really excited and you can see Salda, for the first time since you've seen her, smiles a little bit.

MARISHA: We can't disappoint the children.

TRAVIS: (sighs) Fine. Secret passage it is.

LAURA: Trinket's with you guys, don't forget.

MATT: Trinket's been keeping guard through the mud behind you.

TALIESIN: Let the kids ride Trinket.

MATT: As a relatively stealthy bear would try. As you make your way through the secret passage, successfully finding your way back to Greyskull Keep, you climb up back into the kitchen and there you can see Laina and Erwen who are both sweaty, their stains are soaking through their outfits. They've been working around the clock to make sure that everyone who's currently held within the keep is being cared for and fed, and their faces immediately light up as you all start pouring out of the pantry. “I'm so glad to see all of you. I wasn't sure if you'd come back.”

SAM: Are we there now?

MATT: They're getting there first, before the rest of you. And she runs up and embraces each of you, wipes her brow. “I'll have food soon.”

MARISHA: It's okay, it's okay.

MATT: And she goes over and sees. “And the children, you got children with you?”

TALIESIN: We don't know whose they are.

MATT: The kids get really shy, seem quiet and hide behind Salda. She goes, “It's all right. We'll take them– where should we take them? Where should we go? Lead on, I've never been here before.”

ASHLEY: You can put them in my room.

TRAVIS: Yeah, or mine.

TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll put them up. I can sleep in my workshop.

MARISHA: I think we've pulled a lot of our beds down–

MATT: Yeah, most of the beds, most of your rooms are–

MARISHA: We'll find a place for you. Just get comfortable for right now. It's a little cramped, I'm sorry. It's not Castletop.

MATT: “You saw where we were. We'll take anything at this point.” Gilmore comes in and looks around. “You know, I'm not going to lie, I always wanted to see the place. Perhaps a tour is in order. Tomorrow.” He hangs his head. You make your way into the rest of–

MARISHA: I find a bed. Where's the nearest bed?

MATT: The nearest bed would be one of the beds that you guys moved into Sarenrae's temple.

MARISHA: Is there someone on it?

MATT: There's someone sitting on it, but as soon as you bring someone who looks as wrecked as he is–

MARISHA: I say, hey, beat it.

MATT: Yeah. They get up and leave and you lay Gilmore down.

LIAM: “But my elbow really hurts!”

(laughter)

MATT: After a short time of getting them established with Greyskull Keep, the rest of Vox Machina arrives, the rain now pouring heavily outside. Looking back, you can see some of the smoke has lessened. It's helping put out some of the fires in the remaining piles of burning wood that were once buildings of Emon.

MARISHA: Keyleth runs up to Vax and gives him a hug. You're okay, you're okay? You did it? You talked her out of it?

LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, Keyleth. He talked me out of it. I walk past.

MARISHA: Thank you. And I walk away.

MATT: Okay. As you guys get everyone situated in the Keep, your mind begins to turn to what the next step is in preparing for whatever the next step you want to be. And we'll go ahead and finish tonight's game at that point. Pick this up again next week, so we can go ahead and take a moment here to prepare for Critmas. I know some of you guys have got to run, so if you've got to run, say goodbye to the folks–

LAURA: Oh, you guys are all so wonderful and we love you.

TALIESIN: Sorry.

MATT: We'll stay, we'll open the gifts for them. And get those to them, so we will be surprised for them.

LAURA: Yes, please.

MATT: And also, guys, once again I want to give a big thank you to Jason Charles Miller.

(cheering)

LAURA: Yay, Garthok!

MARISHA: Yeah, Garthok! Party on, Garthok!

JASON: So, also, tomorrow night, on this very channel at 7PM Pacific, 10PM Eastern, I am playing an acoustic concert. Right here, same channel, just one click away.

TRAVIS: In character or as Jason?

JASON: As Jason. Maybe I'll try to write a Garthok song before tomorrow.

MATT: That's awesome. Yeah, great! Yeah, guys, come back tomorrow, 7PM on this channel and go and watch Jason's awesome acoustic concert. He's a phenomenal musician. If you haven't seen his stuff, look it up beforehand just so you can get yourself prepped.

TALIESIN: You can watch a bunch of music videos, too, and maybe see some of us.

JASON: I think most of the people here have had cameos in my videos.

MATT: Yeah, that's true, actually. So, there's that. And, actually, Mark Holmes, who's the dungeon master for the Yogscast RPG show that just started who are friends of ours, he makes a small cameo in one of the videos as well when he was in America briefly, so it all ties together. Yeah, he was there for that shoot. He's in the background with me in one of the shots. Yeah, just look for his nerdy British self. It's great. Love you, Mark. But yeah, Jason, thank you again for playing. Check out Jason tomorrow. Check him out in the Dungeons and Dragons– what's the game title?

JASON: Oh, I'm in Neverwinter. As Drizzt Do'urden–

MATT: As Drizzt Do'urden! Maybe you know the name if you've heard of any of the Forgotten Realms. He's the character that everybody between 1986 and 1995 tried to make.

MARISHA: You're also one of the dudes in Avatar, when they–

MATT: He's been in Avatar a few times.

JASON: Avatar: The Last Airbender, World of Warcraft, a guy in Super Street Fighter–

MATT: Yeah, check out his array of characters he's voiced. He's awesome. Well, guys, thank you so much. We'll be back here in just a few minutes. We're going to prep for Critmas, so yeah. See you soon.

LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

MARISHA: Bye, guys. 

Part I

MATT: Anyway. So. So. Let us go ahead and delve into tonight's game proper, folks. So, to get you up to speed, Vox Machina, the intrepid band of adventurers you see before you, after a series of adventures, had found their way back to their central city of Emon, in the center of the region of Tal'Dorei. After a ceremony in which the leader of their city, Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei, was announcing him stepping down, the town was suddenly under siege by a group of extremely powerful and dangerous ancient dragons that call themselves the Chroma Conclave. After tearing the city asunder in many places, three of them flew off into the east under the instruction of the fourth and possibly largest and leader of the group, that has recently been found to be called Thordak the Cinder King, who currently resides in the center of the city of Emon, claiming that his mercy is only for those who worship him and essentially feed his greed and hunger. As such, Vox Machina, narrowly escaping the battle, a couple of encounters with these dragons, including one above their Keep, are housing a number of survivors who have made their way out of the city and are currently residing in Greyskull Keep for protection. You guys went into the city to see if you could find any other allies and friends that may have survived this encounter. You befriended a member of the Clasp, named Garthok, who walked amongst the rubble and proceeded to show you the secret entrance he knows to the Clasp, of which you may be trying to inquire about information. On your way to that area, you passed by Gilmore's shop, Gilmore being a good friend of the group and a powerful magic practitioner and creator of magical items and artifacts and a number of glorious goods. His abode, however, smashed and currently a pile of burnt wood and rock. Looters were currently poring through, and you attempted to get them to leave the area alone. It came to blows, and with many of the looters falling in battle, two of which were kept locked away. You discovered the location of where they were hoarding the massive amounts of gold and artifacts that they had acquired from the rubble. You then found the secret compartment in which Gilmore's teleportation sigil was locked beneath his shop, where the remaining family of Tal'Dorei, Salda and the three children, as well as Gilmore himself, wounded and barely alive, having saved them. You found that Uriel, the Sovereign, did not seemingly survive the encounter with the dragons, and Gilmore nearly fell going back to try and make sure that you guys were okay, barely escaping with his life. You managed to save his, and taking the children, Salda, Sherri, and Gilmore back to Greyskull Keep, some of you splintered off to try and acquire the goods that were taken from his store, however, they apparently had already been stolen from the location they were being stored in, or been delivered already, you're uncertain as to what became of them, but you get the sense that it was probably best that you chose Gilmore over the gold at first glance. Making your way back to the Keep, you've sent Gilmore up to rest for the evening, some of you have then found your way down into the temple of Sarenrae, where a number of the escaped refugees from Emon currently try desperately to cling to their memories, to try and keep the shakes at bay and contemplate what the next step is for survival in this now partially ruined city. That was where we left off. So. What would you like to do?

SAM: Kill all the dragons and save the day.

MATT: Good! Roll for it.

LAURA: Oh, that was a good roll. See?

TALIESIN: Natural 20. No, no.

MARISHA: Good show, guys.

LAURA: I rolled five natural 20s before the show even started.

SAM: That's a great, great idea.

LAURA: So it's all going to be terrible.

SAM: Why are you rolling before the show?

TRAVIS: She feels like she's got to “warm up” her endless army of dice.

LAURA: No, I just have to figure out which ones I want to use that night.

TRAVIS: You have five d20s right now.

LAURA: I know, and they're all useful. No, I've got six out here.

LIAM: Yeah, yeah, definitely all useful.

TALIESIN: This is, by the way, for anybody tuning in for the first time at home, this is how we express that we have no idea what to do.

SAM: Where are we?

TALIESIN: We're at home.

MATT: You're in Greyskull Keep.

SAM: And Gilmore's with us?

MATT: Gilmore's with you, he's been brought upstairs–

LIAM: And did Pike's holy visitor fix the keep, or is the keep still effed up?

MATT: Actually, in the short time in which her visitor, this angelic deva-like entity that was brought forth from Sarenrae's sphere of influence, did manage to repair entirely the damage that was sustained to the Keep from the battle with Vorugal out in your courtyard. So yes, Greyskull Keep is now back to being intact and rather fairly polished. The stained glass is affixed and corrected.

LIAM: It must look so strange next to the ruined city of Emon.

MATT: It's far enough away, but–

LAURA: Little strange.

MARISHA: So what time is it? It was nighttime, right? Or was it midday?

MATT: It's about midafternoon at this point, maybe pushing into the evening.

TALIESIN: Is Kima still around?

MATT: I'm sorry, what was that?

TALIESIN: Is Lady Kima still around, or?

MATT: Lady Kima's been in Vasselheim.

TALIESIN: Oh, not Vasselheim, I'm sorry. Allura. I'm on the wrong page.

MATT: Yeah, she and Drake went.

MARISHA: Remember, they turned into shooting stars and they flew away.

SAM: Is Clarota still here with us?

(laughter)

LAURA: We're off to a good start tonight, guys.

MATT: In your hearts. In your heart of hearts.

TRAVIS: No, not even there. That piece of shit. Where are the majority of the people? Are they in the dining hall and in the–

MATT: They're scattered between the dining hall and the temple to Sarenrae. Partially because, one, there's enough space there, two, it's a place of sanctity, it's a place of hope, and Pike is currently bringing people– not preaching to them, per se, but offering comfort in their current area of misery and worry. So those are pretty much the localized areas. Occasionally one of the kids might begin wandering the halls, a parent might chase after them, trying to draw them back in, but respectfully, no one's wandering the house filling their pockets, they're all still happy to be alive at this point.

LAURA: Well, that's because we don't have anything, because Scanlan's troupe stole everything anyway.

MATT: There's that, too.

SAM: We bought new silverware.

TRAVIS: Sure we did.

SAM: Maybe it wasn't my troupe, maybe it was our new guests, the people fleeing for their lives.

TRAVIS: I was going to say, are there any new people that have come into the keep while we've been away? Can I ask one of our guards that?

MATT: Sure, yeah. Shayne, who's out front, currently strolling through the courtyard, comes up to you, and as you ask her, she goes, “Well, we've had a few other refugees come in and ask for entry, and we patted them down to make sure there were no weapons and tried our best to keep an eye on them since they arrived. Seems like most everyone's keeping either into the city or keeping fairly underground.”

TRAVIS: Nobody's sticking out to you, though, no shady individuals, nobody sweating more than is necessary when being threatened by a big fuck-off dragon?

MATT: “Not yet, but I believe Jarett's keeping a close eye.”

TRAVIS: Jarett–

SAM: That guy. Man-crush?

TRAVIS: No.

(laughter)

SAM: I wonder, in all prudence, should we go around to the 'fugees, the refugees and do a quick–

LAURA: Insight check?

SAM: – scan, alignment check or something?

TRAVIS: Lauryn Hill is shaking her head.

LAURA: Do we have anything that can sense people's alignment?

SAM: Pike might.

MARISHA: Yeah, I can.

SAM: Can you do a mass, a mass sense alignment?

MARISHA: Mass sense alignment?

SAM: Is that a thing?

MARISHA: No, I'm saying I could do some insight checks on people.

SAM: Oh, I'm talking about your magic.

MARISHA: No, I'm not Pike.

SAM: All right.

TRAVIS: Pike's with us, though, right? She could do an insight check.

SAM: Is she with us?

MATT: Pike is with you. She is currently helping folks inside the temple. But you could go ask her to.

LIAM: Use the skull to wish to know everyone's alignment. Problem solved.

TRAVIS: We'll kill everyone. Kill everyone.

SAM: Maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example.

LAURA: This is terrible, what is happening?

LIAM: This isn't the real game, the game hasn't actually started yet.

MATT: So. Glancing about the populace of scattered refugees throughout the general vicinity of Greyskull Keep, I will pick two of you who wish to be the main surveyors of the crew.

SAM: Is this insight?

MATT: This would be insight, yes.

LAURA: I'm on it.

MARISHA: I'm on it with Vex.

MATT: Okay, so Vex and Keyleth, both you guys roll insight checks, please.

LAURA: See, this is why I shouldn't have this many dice, because I don't know what to choose. Okay. 21.

LIAM: Insight?

MARISHA: 22.

LAURA: 21.

MATT: Okay. Both of you guys spend about ten, 15 minutes or so scanning through the crew, asking a few questions, helping a few folks out while keeping an eye on reactions around the general vicinity. No one sticks out to you as being either hiding their intent, shifty. There are a few folks that are aloof from the whole experience, who seem to be either in a state of shock, or discomfort based on their current surroundings, but nothing in a way that strikes you as nefarious or worrisome.

LIAM: And are they all strangers, other than the people we brought back with us?

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: They are strangers?

MATT: Yeah. There's a lot of people that live in Emon, and none of them seem to catch your eye.

LIAM: Yeah. Is anyone still badly hurt?

MATT: Most of them have had their wounds tended to. There are a few that have general scars, some from elements of frostbite on their skin, who were caught in the blast, who were salvaged after Vorugal left. There are a few that have scrapes and bruises from fleeing from the town, from collapsing debris from different buildings and such, but no serious injuries. A few bone fractures here and there that have been set and bandaged.

LIAM: I'm going to spend the first bit of time at home helping Pike, doing whatever she tells me to do, really, to help the people here.

MARISHA: Is there any deceased that need to be tended to?

MATT: Well, there are a number of deceased in the front courtyard, people that were frozen and shattered as part of Vorugal's attack, which at this point, most of them have been taken care of by the guards and given a proper burial on the outside of the Keep, a few yards away, towards the inside of the one of the hills. They haven't been left to thaw, if that was what you're worried about.

MARISHA: That's what I was worried about.

TALIESIN: Red meat. Red.

LAURA: Gross.

LIAM: Way to go dark. Way to go dark.

TALIESIN: I thought that's what we were doing today.

MATT: Cost-effective. A number of the refugees have also helped the guards as well, transporting the bodies of the deceased and making sure that they're properly interred in the nearby countryside.

MARISHA: Okay.

SAM: What are our options here? First of all, do we know Gilmore's status?

LAURA: Yeah, we need to get him settled in, make sure he's all right.

LIAM: Well, he's gone up, he's resting.

MARISHA: Yeah, we put him to bed already.

LIAM: He's in Percival's room, I think. You said you would sleep in your laboratory.

SAM: And when we last left things, there was one plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves' guild and try to see if there's any more–

LAURA: Yes. Actually, Garthok.

MARISHA: Yes.

LAURA: Garthok is waiting for us down in those, so we can go look at the Clasp and talk to them and everything, because he's told them we're on our way.

SAM: And to what end, again? We're going to see if there's any random diplomats left over?

TALIESIN: They're the only functioning organization left in the city at this point.

LIAM: It's true, they're a double-edged sword, though. I mean, they should not be trusted, we cannot trust them, but they are an infrastructure under the city. They may have more of an idea what's going on than we do. I'm the best to speak to them, but I'm not on good terms with them, and I've never really talked to you about this, but you were marked at one point, a long time ago.

LAURA: What?

SAM: For death?

LIAM: Actually, yes.

LAURA: Why? What did I do?

LIAM: I'm sure I don't know. The reason there is a brand on my back is because I interceded. Some other schmoe died instead of you. You might be a bit of a sore point with them. I don't know. They might not remember, but I don't think that's true, I think they'll remember.

MARISHA: How long ago was this?

SAM: What did you do?

LAURA: So many things.

LIAM: Before we met, when Vex and I were on our own.

SAM: Was it because you farted that time?

LAURA: You didn't think you could mention this? All the times we've dealt with the Clasp? You didn't think it was worth mentioning that I almost died?

MARISHA: She's already been down there. She's already been down there! You think they're going to recognize her now?

LIAM: We're going down to talk.

LAURA: We've been down there to talk.

LIAM: Right. All right.

LAURA: That's why you don't keep secrets.

TALIESIN: Well, I say that we organize a group. Let's not get overexcited about the sudden realization that some of us can be a bit iffy. We've all had a moment, probably within the last three weeks. I'm not saying I don't.

TRAVIS: I haven't.

TALIESIN: Yes, oddly, you and Pike seem to be immune.

TRAVIS: It is a virtue.

TALIESIN: But let's organize a group, and let's at least open relations with them at this point.

MARISHA: Well, hang on, hang on. What are we going to say to them when we get down there? What are we going to offer them?

TALIESIN: We are going to offer them our services in getting this city back to a functioning level. They don't want a city ruled by a dragon, we don't want a city ruled by a dragon. It's in their interest to help us clear the city.

LIAM: They're going to look out for themselves, and you're probably– I'm sure you're right, they want these dragons out, but they will do– they will preserve their own existence, and there's a possibility that bowing before these beasts will preserve their existence.

TALIESIN: Not long-term, and these are groups that think long-term.

MARISHA: Wait, are you talking about us bowing to the Clasp, or the Clasp bowing to the– okay. Sorry, there were levels.

LIAM: And yes, we've been down there, we've argued with them, but we're talking about going down there and making an alliance, an ongoing alliance, and shit might come up, that's all I'm saying.

TALIESIN: Let's make it a business deal. We're talking about making a political decision. This is politics.

TRAVIS: What if they leave? What if they leave the city, or what if they turn us in to the dragon to save their own asses?

TALIESIN: They could. I doubt they'd leave, that's a terrible waste of an investment.

MARISHA: You're essentially relying on the underbelly of Emon to restore it.

TALIESIN: I am, I'm relying on greed, it tends to be exceedingly reliable.

MARISHA: In your experience.

TALIESIN: Yes.

LAURA: In all experience, let's be honest.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

TRAVIS: Said the greedy one to the greedy one.

LIAM: This is one option, are we sure we don't want to seek help–

SAM: Yes, what are our other options?

TALIESIN: I'm curious as to other options.

SAM: We know why the dragons are here, right? Ish?

MARISHA: I really feel like it might be necessary for me to also reach out to the Air and Earth and possibly even the Water Ashari. It might be difficult because I haven't been there yet. To see if they've had any other tears through the other elemental planes.

TALIESIN: That would be quite wise.

MARISHA: We can also seek to employ their services.

TRAVIS: Scanlan.

SAM: Huh?

TRAVIS: What about you becoming a spy?

SAM: I've been thinking about that, long and hard.

MARISHA: Have you?

SAM: Yes.

MARISHA: What are your thoughts?

SAM: Most of what I do is long and hard. And my thoughts are still: fuck you, no way, fuck off.

TRAVIS: So what you're saying is?

SAM: Maybe.

(laughter)

LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance.

TRAVIS: Your shining moment–

TALIESIN: Nothing is ever going to top the triceratops, really.

SAM: Maybe the triceratops could kill all the dragons.

TRAVIS: All right. So we reach out to the Ashari.

TALIESIN: Absolutely.

SAM: How's your homeland?

TALIESIN: I don't know.

SAM: Do we need to find out?

TALIESIN: I would love to.

SAM: You can transport there instantly.

TALIESIN: I can. I just can't get back instantly.

LAURA: You need Keyleth.

TALIESIN: And I figure that they would have sent somebody at this point if things had gone– they have an instant transport to us if they need to find us.

SAM: True.

LAURA: Unless they don't know about the stone and the only one with the stone–

TALIESIN: The Council knows about the stone.

TRAVIS: Or there's no one left to send.

LIAM: Yes, if things went south–

TALIESIN: We would've heard.

MARISHA: I can scry twice today.

TALIESIN: That would be lovely.

MARISHA: I can do it two times. So we need to pick where it's most important to check in versus where we might want to pop in and say hello.

TALIESIN: Whitestone is also somewhere we could arm ourselves more completely against something like this. We're going to have to start–

TRAVIS: With what?

MATT: As a note, too, Pike can also scry as well.

LAURA: Oh, good. Because I would like to check in to Vasselheim as well.

SAM: How do you kill a dragon? Do we need a dragon? Can we get a dragon that hates these dragons? Is that a thing?

LAURA: You know, there is the Slayer's Take.

TRAVIS: Wait, what are we talking about dragons? Do other dragons hate dragons?

SAM: Yeah, could we find a dragon who could fight for us?

LAURA: Well, there's metallic dragons.

LIAM: Don't get along with chromatic.

SAM: Do we know any metallic dragons?

TRAVIS: Yeah, where are they?

MARISHA: We would have to go to Vasselheim and maybe–

TALIESIN: My Aunt Edna.

TRAVIS: What?

TALIESIN: She's a dragon-lady, I don't know if that's the same thing.

MARISHA: Like, oh, like she– little ceramic dragons, she likes collecting them?

TALIESIN: I was mocking him, yes.

SAM: So, wait, the Slayer's Take, what?

LAURA: Well, it's an organization made to hunt massive creatures, isn't it?

LIAM: It's a horde of fucking ass-kickers, is what it is.

TALIESIN: We fought a dragon– we killed a dragon for them.

MARISHA: They're also rooted in Vasselheim, which is–

SAM: It's safe.

LAURA: Yes, but– If everything else is under attack, Vasselheim is inevitable.

SAM: Yes, but they're protected.

LAURA: For a time.

LIAM: Allow me to play tiefling's advocate. If we leave now and allow the Clasp to take hold and form some sort of new shadow government, without us having any part in it, it's out of our control completely. It won't be in our control at all. But maybe if we speak to them now, we'll have a better idea of what's going on. I'm not sold on any idea yet, but if we leave now and let things play out, it's entirely out of our hands.

MARISHA: All right, well, how about this? We can scry, between Pike and I, four times. So we can make four phone calls today.

SAM: Not phone calls, just a look.

MARISHA: Yes, look home. No, we can peek through a window. And we can try and go visit the Clasp.

SAM: Okay, well, let's scry it up, then. Who are we calling? Whitestone, Vasselheim, center of Emon?

TALIESIN: Whitestone and Vasselheim, I think. Definitely.

MARISHA: And I want to check in with–

TRAVIS: Can I object to checking the center of Emon, right? Because that's where the Cinder King is?

TALIESIN: Yes.

TRAVIS: Didn't it, like, ruin magic when we did it to the beholder, didn't it see us and laugh and we were like, augh, it hurts my brain–

TALIESIN: He's got a point. You've got a point.

SAM: You're pretty smart, Grog.

MARISHA: We don't need to scry into Emon.

TRAVIS: I remember.

LIAM: We're talking Vasselheim, yeah? Whitestone. And you can do it another two–

MARISHA: You know what, let's go talk to Pike, because Pike might possibly have some sort of spiritual connection with Vasselheim as well that might save us a scry.

TALIESIN: It's possible that Vasselheim might be our next stop after we secure everything here.

MARISHA: Okay.

SAM: Oh, Pike! Oh.

MARISHA: I can also teleport us once today, if we decide to go anywhere.

SAM: Thanks.

MARISHA: Pike!

SAM: Pike! Pikey!

MATT: Comes out, a little bit of dirt on her brow, looks like she's been busy handling some of the folks–

SAM: I reach out and brush the dirt from above her forehead.

MATT: She smiles and pushes your hand away. “Yes, what, yes?”

MARISHA: Pike, do you have any sort of spiritual connection with Vasselheim? Do you feel– you know how–

MATT: “I do. I do. Why?”

MARISHA: Okay, can you check–

SAM: Can you scry?

MARISHA: Can you see if they're okay? We want to scry and check in with a few places.

MATT: “Of course, of course, no worries.” She ushers you guys back into the temple.

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: And then gets a little nervous when she starts thinking about it and walks up to the central platform of prayer and takes out her holy symbol. Her armor's off right now, by the way, she's in her ceremonial robes. Because it's hard to clank around in armor amongst a bunch of refugees. Sits down and focuses for a second, and pulls out some salt, and begins spreading it into a small triangular shape around her, and then pulls her holy symbol out and closes her eyes, and for that moment, you can see a beam of sunlight come through the roof, the glass roof of the temple, which then refracts into multiple colors that slowly dissipate around her. You can see, everyone else that has gathered in the room falls quiet, and watches on as there is this tiny little visual miracle. And she stays there for a moment. A few more moments. Probably about 30, 40 seconds pass before the light slowly retracts back up through the glass, and she stands up and turns around and goes, “Vasselheim seems fine for now. Untouched from the dragon's scourge, at the very least.”

MARISHA & LAURA: That's good.

TALIESIN: What of Whitestone?

MATT: “Oh. Yes.” She gets right back down into position with an air of begrudging acceptance. Focuses for a second. Spends a few more moments in her scrying ritual before stepping back, and turns slowly to you, Percy, and says, “Whitestone seems fairly overlooked by these dragons as well. The town rebuilds. People seem to be going about their lives. Possibly none the wiser as to what's

"transpired this side of Tal'Dorei.”

TALIESIN: We'll send word, at the very least.

LAURA: It's all over the water. Maybe the dragons haven't gone that far.

TALIESIN: It's far north. I'll make sure to send word.

MATT: “Okay.” One of the kids starts crying, and she goes, “Oh, hold on.” And goes over and starts tending to one of the children who has like a knee brace on, and is currently aching, and she goes to help calm him down. “Shh, shh.”

LIAM: Do you think you could look in on Syngorn?

MARISHA: Of course.

LAURA: Mostly to see, you know.

MARISHA: I step up to the table, and begin my scrying ritual, checking on Syngorn first.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: Shit.

LAURA: Come on.

TALIESIN: We need like cups and string or something.

SAM: We do. Or a walkie-talkie. He's saying, Syngorn is gone.

LAURA: Don't say that.

TALIESIN: Millions dead.

LAURA: Millions. It's very large.

TRAVIS: Remember to shop at Gilmore's Ruined Rubble.

(laughter)

SAM: Oh no, he didn't even get a new franchise before it was–

TALIESIN: For all your reclaimed wood needs.

TRAVIS: Oh. Well done. Well done. That was nice.

TALIESIN: The best was watching Laura go, “Oh what a great i– ooh.”

TRAVIS: And endless supply of pavers and gravel.

SAM: Gilmore's Building Supplies.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: All your home improvements.

MATT: Back to your regularly scheduled D&D game.

SAM: What did you see, Keyleth?

MARISHA: Syngorn is gone. And I don't mean destroyed, I don't mean burnt. I don't mean that it's rubble, I mean it's gone. The city is gone. There's, like, a huge chasm, a huge empty spot in the middle of the forest where Syngorn once lied. Lie.

SAM: Lay. Did it look like it was destroyed to nothing? Or transported somewhere?

MARISHA: Like that. Like transported, like the city was lifted out of its place and was teleported elsewhere.

SAM: Could it have been– I don't know how your scrying works– could it have been some sort of a magical block? Not real, an illusion of some sort?

MATT: I would like Vax and Vex to both roll a history check.

LAURA: Any kind of advantage on that? For growing up there or something?

MATT: Nope, that's– you get to roll this because of that.

LIAM: History?

TALIESIN: Should have stayed in school.

LIAM: Didn't help.

LAURA: Eight.

LIAM: 15.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Can I take a roll just for being a nerd?

LIAM: All out of luck.

MATT: Are you proficient in history?

TALIESIN: I am proficient in history.

MATT: Sure, I'll let you roll.

TALIESIN: I want a nerd roll. 24. Book reading!

MATT: Okay. Being the astute researcher, the indoor kid growing up. Yeah. There aren't a lot of books that made their way north about pure elven culture, especially wooded elves, that comprise the entirety of the Syngorn nation.

TALIESIN: I speak Elven, so that's good.

(laughter)

MATT: It has rarely come into play, but because of previous wars, terrible devastation, and the need for the elvish culture to protect itself, and to maintain its existence, you do know that there have been instances of large enchantments on places of cultural importance that would bridge between here and the Feywild. And as a defense mechanism, essentially, would cloak and/or shift those locations.

TALIESIN: They've gone into hiding.

MARISHA: How can you be sure?

TALIESIN: I can't, but there's reason to believe so. It's what it points to.

LIAM: What points to what? What are you talking about?

TALIESIN: Historically, elves have, in times of great stress, taken important sites, important places, people, and either cloaked them, hidden them, or moved them into the Feywild until such time as the danger has passed. There is precedence for this. They've gone into hiding.

LAURA: Great.

LIAM: That's one more thing our father failed to impart to us.

LAURA: (laughs cynically) At least he's safe.

TALIESIN: Most likely.

MARISHA: I need to check in on the Air Ashari. I'm going to spend my last scrying.

MATT: Okay. As your vision separates from your current place of origin, you find yourself drifting up into the clouds and speeding through the air. The location itself is blurred, though recalling the origin of where you originally came from, you pass by columns of black smoke to your left, you assume somewhere related to Westrunn's current location.

MARISHA: Right.

MATT: Eventually, the clouds part, and you find yourself thrust down upon the earth amongst the center of the Air Ashari tribe. You can see the thin leather constructs that make up a portion of your people's hovels and buildings. You can see the nearby chasm-based windfall that pours through constantly with a gentle whistling sound that forever is marked as the chorus that guides you all to sleep every evening. There, you can see your people amongst various conversations, going amongst their various daily duties, seemingly untouched, unscathed, and unaware of what recent events had transpired.

MARISHA: They're okay.

MATT: That is the last of your scrying capability for the day.

TALIESIN: You didn't have to know that. Big girls don't scry. Sorry, I saw it on Netflix.

LAURA: Wow. Wow. Hit after hit after hit today, Taliesin.

LIAM: You know, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

TALIESIN: I know. I know. Coffee hasn't kicked in yet.

MARISHA: All right, they're okay. They seem unaware, which is very disheartening on a few levels.

TALIESIN: Well, they'll know soon enough.

MARISHA: Exactly.

TALIESIN: We are going to need transport.

SAM: To where?

TALIESIN: Ah. I don't think we're going to win this fight staying here, I think we're going to have to rally power, I think we're going to have to rally allies. I don't think there's enough here for us to win.

LAURA: Can we relocate all of the refugees staying in our walls? Can we bring everyone through the Sun Tree? Keyleth? How long does it stay open?

MARISHA: Six seconds.

TALIESIN: We can go in shifts. This is not something that's going to be solved tomorrow. We can take a week, and move people.

LIAM: That's true. And there's 50 to 100 refugees, you said, something like that, right?

MATT: At this point now, in your keep, surviving, you're looking at the 30s.

LIAM: 30s?

SAM: But there's hundreds more inside the city walls. Thousands.

TALIESIN: We're going– we're not going to be able to empty the city.

LAURA: But we can at least get these people out.

TALIESIN: We can get these people out. And we're going to need– and I apologise for the brightness in my voice– I think we're going to need an airship.

LAURA: An airship sounds wonderful, Percy, but–

LIAM: You mean like the one that crashed?

TALIESIN: Like the one that crashed.

LAURA: One dragon attacking it and it's down.

TALIESIN: We're going to need to move quickly, though, from city to city, and we're going to need to get word.

MARISHA: Well, moving quickly from city to city– I don't know.

TALIESIN: We may have to steal an airship or something.

SAM: You're going to steal a plane?

TALIESIN: I'm making a plan. I'm thinking of a plan.

LAURA: You keep thinking, there.

TALIESIN: It's working.

MARISHA: Well, I mean, I've recently discovered that that misty Wind Walk spell that I cast on all of us is not great for battle, but is great for travel. And that lasts for eight hours.

SAM: What does? Who?

MARISHA: Remember how I failed and almost killed us all?

TRAVIS: Shit the bed. Yeah.

MARISHA: Yeah. Thanks, Grog. What I learned out of that was it's not great for battle, but it is great for travel. It lasts for eight hours. We can move 300 feet per second.

LAURA: Wonderful. We get the refugees out, we go to Whitestone, we talk to them there, we use the Misty Walk thingy and go to Vasselheim, talk to the Slayer's Take. This is perfect. Problem–

SAM: Are we going to check in with the Clasp? I really like Percy's idea about stealing a plane. I'm just throwing that out there.

TALIESIN: There is an empty airdock that's currently not being used in the city.

LAURA: Do we need a ship right now, darling? I understand the joy in it.

TALIESIN: We don't need it now, but we're going to be– need to move–

SAM: We could take all of these refugees with us. Don't you understand? We would be helping humanity.

MARISHA: I'm with Vex. You all honestly–

LAURA: – believe a dragon wouldn't notice a giant airship flying out of the city?

SAM: Not if we hide it with some– some smokescreen action of some sort.

LIAM: Guys. This is an RPG, not a JRPG.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I want to live like Teddy Ruxpin. This is all I've ever wanted.

(laughter)

LAURA: We need to talk to the Clasp first.

SAM: All right, let's go talk to the Clasp. We'll ask them what they think about–

LAURA: Plus Allura and Drake are coming back. We need to talk to them as well. Find out what's going on in Westrunn. And then we need to get everyone out.

MARISHA: I can transport some of us via plants today. I will have to sleep if we want and study to do the Misty Step again.

LAURA: I've got a plan.

TALIESIN: We have time. This is not a one-day plan.

LAURA: Here's a good plan. This is a good plan, though.

LIAM: Here it comes, everybody.

LAURA: Open up the tree. Send a bunch of refugees through.

MARISHA: Shove a bunch in.

LAURA: Shove them through as fast as possible. Percy. You go with them. We keep the stone. You go through. You talk to your sister. You bamf back with the stone.

MARISHA: Let Whitestone know what's going on. Because they're going to freak out if like–

LAURA: And then we talk to the Clasp together.

TALIESIN: I think that's a good plan.

MARISHA: They will freak out if 20 refugees pour out of the Sun Tree. And they have no context.

TRAVIS: Do that first.

MARISHA: Okay. So wait, are you going to go on your mission while we go talk to the Clasp?

LAURA: No, we're going to wait for you. So can we get the refugees together?

MATT: All right, so as you go into the temple and get Pike's attention, you begin to round up the refugees, which as a statement, historically, is already unnerving. You begin to push them all together in a group and tell them what?

LAURA: Well, we comfort them and tell them: all right, obviously Emon is not a safe place to be right now.

MATT: “No, that's true, that's true! It's terrible here!”

LAURA: It's dangerous, and we want to keep all of you as safe as possible.

MATT: “Yes, and thank you for taking us.” Everyone starts cheering.

LAURA: We have a plan.

SAM: We probably can only take a few. It should be women and children.

LAURA: We're going to take those of you who need the most attention first, and we're going to bring you to Whitestone, which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all. It has much need of people who can do an honest day's labor, and you can earn a wage and find a living there, for the time being, and if at some point in time you want to come back to Emon when all of this is done, of course you're more than welcome to.

LIAM: There is opportunity.

MARISHA: And no dragons!

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

LAURA: I'm rolling the gold one! 20?

MATT: Okay! A couple of folks currently, (muttering) “I've never been to Whitestone! Is it cold?”

LAURA: In the winter.

MATT: “It's winter!”

LAURA: Then it could be a little chilly!

SAM: Bundle up! We'll give you some wool blankets for the trip!

MATT: “Okay?”

LIAM: There's definitely no vampires there. None.

MATT: A couple of kids go, “Vampires, sir?”

LAURA: I like that we're sending to them to the place that's got the orb of death.

MATT: “What was that? What'd you say?”

SAM: No, nothing, she didn't say anything.

LAURA: I said, “You might be able to see your breath!”

MATT: “Winter! Right! Okay, let's grab our things!” And some of the folks start getting their things together. Packing up their things– what they had on their back, essentially, as they rushed here. Shake a few out of their shell-shock, and they all gather up towards the center of the Temple of Sarenrae.

LAURA: Percy– stone. To go through the–

TALIESIN: I already gave it to Keyleth.

LAURA: Oh, okay.

MARISHA: DM question? How many do you think I can fit through in six seconds?

MATT: We'll find out!

MARISHA: If I put them in like a line, and we're like, “Go! Go! Go!”

MATT: That's up to you guys! How do you want to do this?

LIAM: They can't get– no one can get cut in half, can they?

LAURA: Well I assume, as soon as we see it start to shrink, we stop! We cut off the line.

MARISHA: Well, what we should do– here's the thing that I'm worried about. We don't want, like, a kid to go through, and then they get separated from their mom.

TRAVIS: Well, everybody's got to grow up at some point.

LAURA: Anybody with children. How many children are here?

MATT: I'd say you have seven children.

LAURA: Children with their moms go– and families go first.

LIAM: Well, we were saying that the terribly injured, the people with the worst injuries–

LAURA: All right, those people first!

LIAM: Yeah, those people first.

TRAVIS: Yeah, because they'll go through real fast.

LIAM: And then with kids– But they need attention now! They need–

SAM: Hey! We're going to be doing this every day for several days.

TALIESIN: Hey, I've got a weird theory. Let's not send people with injuries yet, so that perhaps Pike can stay here and take care of them for a little bit?

LAURA: Oh! Good call, okay! So the injured can stay.

TRAVIS: Can't we put them on a wagon? Can't we like put them on a wagon, down and like–

TALIESIN: We don't want to lose a wagon to Whitestone.

SAM: This is just how Schindler did it, by the way.

LAURA: What!?

SAM: He debated it for a while, and then– (nervous laughter).

LIAM: No words! No words!

TRAVIS: And the room goes silent, and the mug comes up.

LAURA: Okay. So not the injured.

Families first. How about that?

TALIESIN: We'll count to six, and then we'll put the rope down, and when we hit six, we pull the rope, and it'll hold everybody–

SAM: Wait, there's a rope?

LAURA: As soon as we see it start to shrink, I'll hold the people back.

TALIESIN: Yes, hold the people back.

LAURA: So Percy, you're first, everybody follow through. So any families here? Families?

MATT: Some of the kids raise their hands, some adults go over and they grab kids' hands and stand next to them. “Yes.”

LAURA: Are you really respons– I can tell when you're lying, sir. Are you responsible for that child?

MATT: Make an insight check.

LAURA: 26!

MATT: Ha! Two of those people are definitely just taking a kid's hand in hopes of getting through first.

TRAVIS: I walk in and start cracking my knuckles behind Vex.

MATT: “Well, I mean, I can wait, no worries! Eh–”

LAURA: Child, where's your parents? Do you have one?

MATT: “They haven't shown up yet.”

LAURA: Oh, dear.

SAM: Leave them here, in case the parents come.

LAURA: Okay. Then you would stay and wait for your family, potentially?

LIAM: You can stay with Pike, for now.

MATT: Pike comes over and pats him on the shoulder. They're the same height, so it's easy.

MARISHA: Let's do completed full families who are comfortable relocating.

LAURA: That can move. Here we go.

MATT: Altogether, completed full families, there are two.

MARISHA: How many people?

MATT: It'd be a total of eight people.

LAURA: That's good! That's a good amount!

TRAVIS: Yeah, think about it! One one thousand, one one thousand–

LAURA: And then, any other like single people that can move fast?

MARISHA: Yeah, a couple single people? To bring up the rear?

MATT: Okay. You have about ten more people that raise their hands.

TALIESIN: We can get that many through in six seconds.

SAM: What are you talking about?

LAURA: Get ready to run, people.

MARISHA: All right. So let's go to the tree. Percy, you're going to lead. Percy, you're going to lead. We're going to put the eight up front, with the ten, 15 stragglers behind. I tell them all: all right. As soon as you see that tree start to part, run! Run your face off! I tell that to the crowd.

TALIESIN: And keep running. So that you make room for everyone behind you, we don't want like– it's not the bottom of an escalator. Whatever that is. It's a thing I've been working on, it's going to be great.

MARISHA: Don't stop in the tree, you will create terrible congestion.

LAURA: Everybody comfortable with the plan?

SAM: Can I inspire Keyleth for this?

MATT: Sure.

SAM: Okay, I will perform a limerick for her to inspire her. I know an airheaded young druid / whose plans are more gassy than fluid / when the battle starts / she turns her pals into farts / they see danger and pass right through it!

MARISHA: Thank you, Scanlan. I love it. It's so like me.

MATT: Take a 1d10 inspiration die.

TRAVIS: I hate to be the detail-oriented one about this whole thing, but should somebody be counting as soon as she starts so we put down an arm at six?

LAURA: You count in your head, Grog.

TRAVIS: You really don't want me to do that.

MARISHA: Maybe with my inspiration, I can get a few more seconds in there?

MATT: We shall see. I'll say for the sake of this, go ahead and roll a wisdom check.

MARISHA: Oh boy.

MATT: A d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

MARISHA: Oh, that's not good.

SAM: You've got inspiration if you need it.

MARISHA: Can I add my inspiration to this?

MATT: Go for it.

MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. That helps a lot. What am I adding? Just my straight wisdom?

MATT: Yep, wisdom modifier.

MARISHA: My modifier? 19 total.

MATT: 19 total, okay. So as you all gather around in the center of the temple, Keyleth, you step up to the outside of one of the two front trees to the temple, one of the ones you guys usually use to transport to and from here. As you focus in and reach your hand out and touch the outside of the tree's bark, with a rough tearing sound, the tree bark widens into an oval-shaped doorway that is immediately visible. On the opposite side, you can see before you a lightly snow-dappled landscape that is the central market of Whitestone.

LAURA: We put blankets on everybody, right?

MATT: From what you had.

MARISHA: Go! Go! Now, run, go! Go, Percy, go!

MATT: Who's pushing?

TALIESIN: I'm already through.

MATT: Percy's through. All right, are you guys just letting them go at their own rate?

TRAVIS: (shouting) Move your fucking asses!

MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

MARISHA: It's like a football line.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: 17. With that, everyone goes, (startled noise) and starts charging through wildly. The crowd starts pushing through.

MARISHA: I'm trying to hold it.

LIAM: No severed limbs, no whammies!

MATT: Okay. All of the rest– the family people go through, the young folks push through. You manage to get a total of 23 people through.

(cheering)

MATT: Some folks who weren't even planning to go on this were so driven by the sudden shouting Grog voice echoing from behind that they charged forward Black Friday-style, and managed to escape the tail end of the spell tapering the doorway off.

LIAM: “I regret nothing!”

SAM: Well, I hope Percy comes back soon.

MARISHA: I've got the gatestone.

MATT: Percy?

TALIESIN: I'm going to get everybody organized. Everyone, please follow me. We're heading towards the main castle.

MATT: They're all looking around.

TALIESIN: Welcome to Whitestone.

MATT: A gentle snowfall is coming down. The sky itself you can see is covered in light, white

clouds. Just enough moisture to carry the little snowfall that's happening. There are folks in the center of the town that are surprised to see this arrival, but recognize you and cheer a little bit. “Hey! Percival.”

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Thank you for that smattering of applause. Golf claps, please. Golf claps.

MATT: The refugees all gather up behind you, and you guys walk towards Castle Whitestone.

TALIESIN: We make our way to the castle.

MATT: The guards greet you and lead you inside. And within a few minutes, Cassandra comes down from the upper floor. “Percival, you've returned.”

TALIESIN: Things are not going well. Have you heard any news of Emon and what has been transpiring there?

MATT: “No, we've been focused on restoring our city. Why?”

TALIESIN: Yesterday, we were attacked by a group of chromatic dragons. The city is destroyed. There's no simple way to say this, but we're under siege. We were afraid that Whitestone would be destroyed, as well, but it seems that they have passed over you so far, but we fear for many cities' safety. I was hoping that it would be all right if we moved a small number of refugees through to Whitestone for the time being. Less than a hundred, I imagine. These are the first 20-some-odd that we've pulled through.

MATT: And she looks behind you, looks to the crowd, snaps her fingers. Some of the guards step forward, she goes, “Please, if you would make sure to find any of the various unoccupied buildings are provided to these refugees. Thank you.” And the guards nod, and begin gathering the group and sending them back into town, and she gives you a look back and says, “For better or for worse, we happen to have a number of vacancies in the city due to recent events. But–”

TALIESIN: Oh! Well, yes. Nothing I– Anything I should know about?

MATT: “No, just– We've lost many in the struggle against the Briarwoods. But yes, they will be provided for, I assure you.”

TALIESIN: So I will let you know to stop all business with Emon for now. Be very wary, prepare the city for a possible dragon attack. Things are looking dark.

MATT: “Yes, yes.”

TALIESIN: And if it's possible, any research– any energy that can be put forward towards mounting some sort of defense against these creatures would be greatly appreciated.

MATT: “Right, right, well, we had a few individuals that were researching the ziggurat beneath the city. Two left a while back and we had one arrive just the other day.”

TALIESIN: Who arrived the other day?

MATT: “I cannot recall his name– Realm Seeker, Realm Seer– I'm not–”

LAURA: (whispering) Eskil Ryndarien!

TALIESIN: Please bring me to him.

MATT: All right, Cassandra leads you down into the city again, and one of the houses has been provided, she knocks on the door, the door opens and you see stepping out, an older gentleman who you've heard of but not really had an encounter with since– no, actually you encountered him for the final ritual that took the phylactery from Grog's chest.

TALIESIN: Oh my god.

MATT: But this is Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, the archmage that basically was one of the folks who lived within Westruun and was called to Whitestone as part of research–

TALIESIN: That's some pre-stream stuff, everybody.

MATT: As the door opens, he comes out, eyes adjusting to the light, and you can see the interior is very dark. He's one of those live-in-lightless-territory types of person. Comes out with his round spectacles around his nose, his robe is disheveled, bundled over his shoulders, he goes, “Yes, if I may be of service–?”

TALIESIN: We've met! You look very familiar.

MATT: “Quite! Yes we have. You're with those S.H.I.T.s, weren't you?”

TALIESIN: (laughing) Ah, yes.

MATT: “Unfortunate title you've chosen–”

TALIESIN: Long gone, thankfully, long gone. We're Vox Machina–

MATT: “Good! Vox Machina, glad you took my suggestion.”

TALIESIN: Yes, thank you for that.

(laughing)

MATT: “What can I do for you?”

TALIESIN: Well, first of all, how goes the research into the–

MATT: “Frustrating, to say the least. It appears that this entire–” and he walks back into the house, expecting you guys to follow. As you enter, immediately you're hit with the smell of sage and other burning herbs, and you can see there's a vast number of books that are strewn about the table in front. The fireplace in the back is pouring smoke up into the roof area and soot's starting to gather on the stonework on the outside. Looks like there's two or three different kettles going off with different types of tea. It's complete chaos in here, but he seems to be in control of most of it, at least. He goes, “From best we can ascertain, this is some sort of a magical siphon device. It has prevented us from utilizing any sort of ritualistic endeavors in ascertaining its nature, it's quite perplexing. I'm hoping to either head over to Wildemount, or perhaps return to the Cobalt Reserve and perhaps find some historical information about such an object, but nothing in my current–”

TALIESIN: Well, sir, I have some bad news for you. I hail from Emon, which has been attacked by chromatic dragons–

MATT: “I'm sorry, what?”

TALIESIN: Dragons have declared war on civilization. A group of dragons have destroyed our city, and they have destroyed other cities as well. We are in desperate need of powers to defend ourselves with– So I would be very careful and send forward– Send word ahead of yourself before you travel anywhere, it may not be there by the time you get there.

MATT: “Well, I guess it's good that I moved my tower before I left.”

TALIESIN: Things are looking grim and I would ask while you– If you intend to remain and work on your research on this anomaly beneath our city, perhaps thinking as to how it may be turned into a weapon for our use against these creatures would not be out of the realm of question, and any information you do have of the chromatic dragons would be invaluable. Any research that can be done. We are at war.

MATT: “This is very disconcerting news. I will do what I can. Unfortunately, I'd have to get back to the Cobalt Reserve. That's where most of my research is completed.”

TALIESIN: That's Westruun?

MATT: “Let me see. Jeckt–” And he snaps his fingers, and you can see his manservant, Jeckt, who you've met before, slicked-back darkish red hair, mustache, very prim and proper-type manservant, well-dressed, steps out of the shadows. “Yes, my lord?” “If you would be so kind, prepare me for travel, pack up this–”

TALIESIN: Westruun is no more, sir.

MATT: “Well, that's really frustrating!”

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: “Really.”

TALIESIN: Extremely aggravating.

MATT: “Yes. I am unhappy with this circumstance! How am I supposed to do my research without a place to do my research?!”

TALIESIN: Well, we hope that you will find our winters here quite solitary, and convenient on that level. Things are looking grim.

MATT: “Well, you can say that again.”

TALIESIN: I must go. I have other work to do to start preparing–

TRAVIS: Peace!

MATT: “Yes, yes go! Do your thing!”

TALIESIN: Good day, sir. And good luck to you.

MATT: “Should I find anything, how will I– whereabouts– Where are you?”

TALIESIN: We don't know yet, but we will be returning here.

MATT: “That does not help me. I will do my best.”

TALIESIN: Cassandra will be able to get a hold of me if necessary.

MATT: “Ah, Cassandra. All right! Someone of use around here.”

TALIESIN: I am going to go find my sister and make my way to the stone.

MATT: He doesn't even say goodbye to you. He's completely flustered. It's funny. For everyone who's taken completely by the horror of the situation, he just seems really perturbed about the–

TRAVIS: Inconvenience of it all.

MATT: Yeah, it's so inconvenient. That library was very helpful.

TALIESIN: Why isn't the internet working! (frustrated noise)

MATT: Basically. You find your way to Cassandra again. She's waiting outside of the room. “I hope he's been helpful, brother”

TALIESIN: No, he wasn't helpful, but it was very helpful the way he wasn't helpful.

MATT: “Yes.”

TALIESIN: It's a strange, strange–

MATT: “He's a very strange man.”

TALIESIN: Everything's going to be all right.

MATT: “I hope so.”

TALIESIN: Thank you. I will return very soon. We will, again with your permission, hopefully be using Whitestone as a place to regroup and prepare ourselves.

MATT: “Is there worry that these dragons might come here?”

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: “How will we stop them?”

TALIESIN: You'll hide. I have thoughts, perhaps of a weapon. I don't know. But we're going to find a way to stop them.

MATT: “We have to.”

TALIESIN: I'm not good at being the bearer of any bad news, but this is very dangerous and I don't know what we're going to do.

SAM: (whispers) Steal an airplane.

MATT: “Neither do I.”

TALIESIN: (whispers) They don't have an airplane.

MATT: “Stay safe, Percival.”

TALIESIN: I shall return soon.

MATT: “I hope so. We'll do what we can in the meantime to see to your refugees and hopefully try and prepare ourselves.”

TALIESIN: There will be a few more through, possibly tomorrow, with word.

MATT: “All right. We'll be prepared. Thank you.” She reaches out and puts her hand on yours, again, and looks you sternly in the face and goes, “Be careful.”

TALIESIN: I will.

MATT: “You're all I have left.”

TALIESIN: And Cassandra, I'm proud of you. You're doing very well here.

MATT: “There's still a ways to go, brother.”

TALIESIN: We'll get there.

MATT: She hands you the gatestone. And with that, there's a slight popping sound as you're in a very soft bit of bluish-purple light. Your body slowly subsides and fades into nothing before it (poof) vanishes out of existence. As you guys are back at the keep, suddenly, who has the gatestone? As you're holding it, it begins to shake in your hand and give off a warm light.

MARISHA: I think our reservation's ready.

SAM: I'm telling the, what, seven remaining refugees?

MATT: You have about eight or nine.

SAM: Sorry you didn't make it through. It doesn't mean that you'll be here forever. We'll get you there tomorrow. No big. Don't worry about it.

LAURA: More food for you guys, which is A+.

MATT: At which point now, there's a slight smell of burnt cedar before the air itself begins to sound like a light hum or vibration as suddenly Percy's form (poof) appears in the center of the room next to your gatestone. Both of the stones you guys are holding all of a sudden become white-hot, and you instinctively drop them before they tumble to the ground.

LAURA: Hey! They work!

TALIESIN: They hurt. Good to know.

SAM: That's great. Did you see your sister?

TALIESIN: I did, everything is fine up there, the research continues. They're happy to take people.

LAURA: That's wonderful.

TALIESIN: So, and they are prepared for more. They're also happy to be a base of operations as we put things together.

LAURA: And you told them to make preparations in case something happens?

TALIESIN: Whatever preparations one can make for something like this, to be prepared to hide. (sighs) For now.

LIAM: In the worst-case scenario they can go underground.

TALIESIN: Worst-case scenario, they can go underground, yes.

LAURA: They need to start hiding food.

TALIESIN: They have to grow food, they haven't really recovered that yet. There's also a–

MARISHA: Hopefully I hooked them up there.

TALIESIN: I have one of those terrible ideas I get on occasion.

SAM: What is it? I love it.

TALIESIN: That thing beneath Whitestone could be a weapon.

SAM: How?

TRAVIS: Ooh, that's true.

LAURA: Anything touching it disintegrates.

TRAVIS: Yeah! Like a dragon.

SAM: Do you shoot it at something?

TALIESIN: I might be able to turn it into a projectile.

LAURA: How would you turn it to a projectile– are you okay, Keyleth?

LIAM: It is a fun idea–

TALIESIN: A long-term idea.

MARISHA: Just choking on Percy's idea.

TALIESIN: I can make an antimagic missile.

MARISHA: What– a magic– a magic missile? An antimagic missile?

TALIESIN: An antimagic missile.

LIAM: One plus one plus two plus one.

LAURA: One plus two plus one plus one!

SAM: That's a great idea.

TALIESIN: I've been– I've been mulling it over.

SAM: Could we fire it from an airship of some sort?

TALIESIN: Yes, I have– that's actually part of the idea.

MARISHA: Percy, when I tried to touch that thing it was like it was sucking me in. I don't think that thing and me touched. How are we going to turn it into a projectile?

TALIESIN: I have thoughts, I'm going to follow them through, and it may require some experimentation in the future, but I think perhaps–

MARISHA: At the cost of possibly your life?

TALIESIN: I take my life into my hands any time I build something. I think that a non-magical approach to containing it might actually work. I think the problem is–

LAURA: Well that's good, because it cancels out any magic–

TALIESIN: I think the problem is that we keep trying to magic our way out of something that denies magic, and maybe I can engineer our way out of it.

MARISHA: Have they found anything out, did you get any updates?

TALIESIN: A little bit of information, there will be more later. I'm going to take a look at all the data and see if it's possible.

SAM: Should we go visit the Clasp?

TRAVIS: Oh, please.

TALIESIN: I'm trying to be more open.

TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go!

MARISHA: What time is it?

MATT: At this time? It's pretty close to dusk, the sun is getting close to the mountain line, you probably have another hour of daylight.

MARISHA: Okay.

TALIESIN: To the Clasp?

TRAVIS: Yeah, they're probably nocturnal anyway. That means they're around at night.

TALIESIN: They're not turtles, no.

MARISHA: Did you learn something new, Grog?

TRAVIS: What?

MATT: All right, you guys heading back into Emon?

SAM: Everyone? Some? All?

TALIESIN: I think Pike should stay behind to take care for–

MARISHA: You seem to have reservations–

SAM: Vex, are you okay going down there? You're marked for death by these people.

LAURA: I've been down there several times without knowing that.

SAM: I know, I feel like it might put you on edge.

LIAM: She's not marked for death, she was marked for death, it's just awkward. It's awkward. I'm not a full-fledged member, they don't like me. I don't like them!

LAURA: Maybe I can become a member.

LIAM: Maybe you can.

TALIESIN: This is politics, you're not supposed to like them.

LIAM: Well, let's go, then.

TRAVIS: Yeah! What he said.

MATT: You guys taking the tunnel or you walking in?

LAURA: Taking the tunnel, we're taking the secret entrance–

TRAVIS: Oh come on, we're never even– we've not even walked in yet.

LAURA: Garthok showed us the secret entrance, he's waiting for us and having them prepare our way, this could get bad.

MATT: No, are you guys walking through your tunnel to the city, is what I'm saying.

LAURA: Oh! That! Yes. Cool.

LIAM: We're not going to walk in the open.

SAM: What are we doing?

LAURA: We're taking our secret tunnel into the city.

SAM: Okay. It puts us in the wrong side of the city, but it's okay.

LAURA: What else are we going to do?

MARISHA: (coughing)

LAURA: How you doing there? You okay?

MARISHA: I'm good. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I got a piece of chip stuck.

TALIESIN: No, I'm going to leave one with Vax.

TRAVIS: What is it?

TALIESIN: I'm giving Vax my gatestone.

LIAM: That's a good idea.

TALIESIN: I'm giving you the other one.

LIAM: For now, it's a good idea, I won't hold onto it forever.

TALIESIN: He's the one who's going to get stuck in a room alone if they decide they don't like him.

LIAM: Can we call this the Jenga stone? In moments of need.

TALIESIN: Jenga stone. Remember, it takes about a minute to work.

LIAM: Do I need to spend a little time with this?

MATT: No. However, it does work only once a day.

LIAM: Once a day?

MATT: After another long rest you'd be able to use it again.

LIAM: All right. Good to know. All right.

SAM: Into the city.

LAURA: In your pants.

MATT: Like you do. Half-elven storage space. You guys find your way back into Emon, utilizing your secret tunnel entrance, coming up through the false outhouse once again. You leave the chain behind, locking it up, and make your way into the city.

LAURA: Cast Pass Without a Trace on us.

MATT: All right. You guys, I'd like you all to make a stealth check.

TRAVIS: Come on, giant blue nut ball dice.

Natural 20!

LAURA: Aw, it fell out of my hand. I don't think it should count if it fell.

MATT: Nope, too bad.

LAURA: Aw, that's mean. Oh, I get advantage!

SAM: Oh, and we get a plus ten, right?

TALIESIN: 33.

SAM: 15.

MARISHA: 35.

LIAM: 38.

LAURA: 35.

TRAVIS: Natural 20.

SAM: Wait. With no judgment, is Trinket coming?

LAURA: Trinket is staying with Pike.

SAM: That's a fine decision.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: Hell hath frozen over.

MATT: Placing Trinket over here.

LAURA: Oh! He's crying! I'm crying.

MATT: So as you guys start dodging between the alleyways, making your way towards the north side of Emon, alongside the ruined interior of the Cloudtop District, you instinctually begin to– and I'd say– who else has proficiency in perception?

LIAM: Right here.

MATT: All right. You guys all start noticing there are what looks initially like flocks of birds moving through the sky. Some of them are heading down into parts of the town in the distance. As you continue to push forward, one set of four in particular start heading overhead. You look up and you can see a small cluster of about five or six flying creatures. Not dragon-sized, by any means, but either a very, very large bird or something of that degree. You can't make out the details, as right now as the sun's beginning to set, a lot of it's dark against a red-orange sky. You keep yourself at bay, waiting for them to pass.

MARISHA: Oh, waiting for them to pass?

MATT: Unless you guys want to do something else.

LAURA: As a dragon-favored enemy, could I guesstimate what those winged creatures are that would hang out around dragons?

TRAVIS: Could you determine if they're wyverns?

MATT: Yes. They are actually indeed wyverns. Wivverns. However you want to pronounce it. Both work in my world. It's fine.

LIAM: It's pronounced 'jif'.

MATT: Yes.

(laughter)

MATT: I will fight you. But yeah.

SAM: They're diving into the city?

MATT: You can see a few that dove into city and stayed there. And one group goes overhead, and continues onward.

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: Pushing forward, deeper into the city, you make your way through the Temple District, and start pushing through Abdar's Promenade once again, retracing your steps from the day before, dodging through open areas as fast as possible to stay within the shadows. All of you go darting into one of the alleyways. As you turn behind you, you can see your tiny-legged gnomish bard friend, keeping up as best as he can before his foot hitting a divot on the ground and (slam) falling face first on the ground, making just enough noise–

SAM: Sorry. Sorry.

MATT: You hear a little screech in the distance. (screech) And coming up on the rooftop, you can see, perched up there, appears to be one wyvern that is looking over down at the currently toppled gnome, and on top of the wyvern, you see something riding it. Something that is holding reins on the edge, something humanoid is glancing over, just a little enough of a shadow, to see.

SAM: He sees me? I see him?

MATT: He looks down at you, yeah.

SAM: Okay. I will cast Hold Person on him.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: I don't know what he is, but I want him to stop.

LIAM: And Scanlan's the only one– we all see it?

MATT: You all barely see it looking over the edge as Scanlan's there, left in the middle of the main walkway. That is going to be a natural 17 on the will save. That'll be an 18. What's your DC?

SAM: Well, it's 17, but the hand-cone makes it 19.

LAURA: Ah-ha!

SAM: Do you think I had the wherewithal to use it?

MATT: With having you fallen on your face, I'd say probably not. Since it wasn't specified, that would be a DC of 17. So the creature seems to rear back for a second, shake its head, and you get a little bit of a look at the features at this point, too. And it is humanoid, but you can see its outer body is not fleshy, or smooth, it is scaled and bumpy. You can see ridges across the back of the head, and in one of the hands, looks like some sort of a spear. Immediately as it rears back, it puts its head up and goes (guttural gibberish).

LAURA: The creature?

MATT: Yeah, riding on the back of the wyvern.

LAURA: Those are the things that attacked the airship!

SAM: Yes. Possibly.

MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

TALIESIN: This is going to be fun.

LAURA: I think you should turn it into a bunny, Keyleth! Turn it into a bunny.

MARISHA: Jesus Christ. I can do that today. Just rolled shitty on my initiative.

LIAM: Not too good.

SAM: (singing) This is the music that plays when we fight!

MATT: All right, so! Scanlan, as you were running across the thoroughfare, you tripped and fell that way.

SAM: That's me!

MATT: The rest of you had come into this alley over here. Currently, looking over the top of this rooftop, is this wyvern and its rider.

MARISHA: I love that the rider is like (derpy noise).

MATT: (imitates derpy noise) It's fine.

MARISHA: Go home, rider, you're drunk.

MATT: That's going to be– 25 to 20?

TALIESIN: 26.

TRAVIS: 20.

MATT: 20. All right, 20 to 15?

LAURA: 18.

MATT: 18, let's see. Vex. 15 to ten?

SAM: Yikes.

MATT: Ten to five?

SAM: Eight! No, seven.

MARISHA: Five.

MATT: (laughs) Okay.

TALIESIN: Wow.

LIAM: Uno!

MATT: Plus?

LIAM: Oh, six, thanks for that.

MATT: So you would be– actually, technically, Keyleth, is next to you.

LIAM: That was so crushing, to see the number on the die.

MATT: Aw, sorry buddy. It happens to the best of us. All righty. So. Currently with this guy up on top of the rooftop, Percy, you are first.

TALIESIN: Quick question, is he in flight, or is he just sitting on the rooftop?

MATT: Just sitting on the roof, perched on the edge. You can't even actually see him, everyone else who's near the front can see, the few that made the check. You've got a little bit of movement up there, but you're just out of view with the building– you're right in an alleyway.

TALIESIN: There's no easy way up onto the roof, is there?

MATT: Aside from a well-placed acrobatics check. You could try.

TALIESIN: That would be my whole movement, too, wouldn't it, though?

MATT: Most likely.

TALIESIN: Nah, let's see.

TRAVIS: And how high is the roof?

MATT: I'd say it's about anywhere from 16 to 20 feet tall. It's two-story, but it's not extremely well-built.

TALIESIN: I'm going to try to get a vantage point where I can at least get where he's only three-quarters cover. So I suppose I'm going to head south down the alley to see if I can get a–

MATT: Pushing to these guys?

TALIESIN: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, so one– You can get to about there if you want to.

TALIESIN: I can get a good look at him there.

MATT: You can see, yeah. He'll have half-cover from there.

TALIESIN: Half-cover's fine. So, if I were to knock him prone, would he fall off the roof, or could I try and push him off the roof? These are my–

MATT: For the wyvern, or for the rider?

TALIESIN: The wyvern.

MATT: You can try. It's hard-pressed, he's sturdy on the side, knocking him prone might fall over onto the rooftop. Who knows if it'll slide or not. It's your call. What do you want to try?

TALIESIN: I'll try knocking him prone, and see if that does it.

MATT: Okay!

TALIESIN: Actually–

SAM: Do it!

TALIESIN: Yeah, it's either that or try and push him off the roof, which could be pretty funny. I'll try and knock him prone.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: All right. So I'm going to use Bad News, because that's funnier.

MATT: Okay. So (whoosh) you whip out.

TALIESIN: Take a shot. That's a 28 to hit.

MATT: That'll hit.

TALIESIN: And that's a wing shot, so you have to make a constitution saving throw.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Against 18.

MATT: Well, this is the wing or leg shot, right?

TALIESIN: Wing or leg shot. I'm sorry, that's a– Actually, I'm sorry, I have the new sheet.

MATT: Yeah, new sheet on that one. Updated that.

TALIESIN: Strength saving throw. Sorry, strength saving throw against 18.

MATT: Okay. That's a natural 19 plus four for strength, so that's a 23 on the save.

TALIESIN: Motherfucker, but he'll still take some damage.

MATT: Still takes damage though, go ahead and roll.

TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at him, too, because eff that. I was not quite prepared for this. 2d12 plus six, four, eight, 14 points of damage.

MATT: 14 points of damage, nice. All right.

TALIESIN: And I'm going to take a– reload, take another shot and try and knock him off the roof.

MATT: Go for it. The same shot?

TALIESIN: Same shot. Ugh. That's a three, so that means I–

MATT: Misfire.

SAM: Clank!

MATT: So, first shot of Bad News, (explosion noise) echoes, the sound of the blast rippling through the nearby alleyways, the blast hits the wyvern in part of its arm, sending a spray of blood as it shrieks in pain. As you can see its rider is moved to the side, and you see a second head behind the rider from the reaction of movement. Looks like there's actually two of these creatures riding on the back of this creature. As you go to reload, bring Bad News up again to fire a second time, you pull the trigger and there's a (thump) sound, and you can see now a stream of smoke pouring out the back of the gun itself, and you're a little worried what this is going to do if you don't fix it soon.

TRAVIS: Look down the barrel!

SAM: Yeah, that'll work.

TALIESIN: I can use my– I actually can't do– Am I going to panic and try and fix this?

MATT: Next turn? That's your movement, that's your three attacks, do you have a bonus? Anything?

TALIESIN: I can– I'm going to, I'm going to throw an action surge and see if I can fix this.

MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and make your tinker check.

TALIESIN: Yes! Yeah, 14.

MATT: So you spend your action quickly trying to fix the gun and get Bad News back. You manage to clear the barrel, get the pellet out, as the rest of the team starts coming up with their turns. That'll be the rest of your action. Okay, finishes Percy's turn. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: I'd like to hold my turn until it gets off the roof and maybe comes down to the ground.

MATT: Okay, okay, good to know. Let's see here. It appears that my– Taliesin, could you do me a favor and hand me that box next to the fridge there?

TALIESIN: Sure.

MATT: Thank you. All right, so Grog, as you're doing that, the blasting sound of Bad News that echoed through, you all of a sudden start hearing other shrieks in the distance, like a call to arms of a number of other entities.

MARISHA: Oh boy.

MATT: As you see a multitude of other winged creatures begin to arise in the distance.

TALIESIN: I shouldn't have gotten him that box, should I?

MARISHA: Was that in the box?

TRAVIS: Yeah, we could always run, too.

TALIESIN: Could.

SAM: How far are we from the tunnel system? Far.

MATT: You're a ways. Probably a good 25-minute run. There's another one on the roof over here. And there's one on this roof here. Each one of them with their own riders, as well.

LAURA: Shit.

MATT: Now. All right, so for this turn, this one leaps off and swoops down here to where Percy is while both of its riders leap off to the side. One that leaps off and rushes over to Scanlan on the ground, and this other one that gets right up next to Percy. This one goes flying forward and lands in the center to about there. Two of its riders leap off. This one stays up in the air over this way in a flanking position– or in a visual perspective with two of its riders on its back. Put them there.

LIAM: For clarification, does this count as turns, or are they, since they're coming late to the party, or this is just them in position?

MATT: This is them now entering the fray.

LIAM: Are they into the initiative order, just gameplay talk?

MATT: Yeah. Well, this is the initiative I rolled for them after being called by the guy who was already shouting out into the air.

LAURA: Oh, right, right, right.

MATT: You didn't see them before, given your perspective. These guys leap off over here– over there. Okay. So we have, first the wyvern that swooped down on you, Percy, is going to go ahead and make an attack with its bite and an attack with its stinger as a multiattack. So that first strike, that is going to be a– The bite, 13?

TALIESIN: That does not hit.

MATT: The stinger, however, is a 19.

TALIESIN: I'm going to use my Amulet of the Shield and up my AC for that attack to 23, so.

MATT: Yeah. So that will miss. So that uses the Amulet. Good to know. So the stinger goes to strike you after the bite misses, and as you grasp your chest, you can see now an arcane barrier shines in front of you and completely ricochets the stinger out into the air to the side as it reacts angrily. The other giant humanoid lizard creature that's coming towards you with a giant heavy club is going to attempt to slam you with it.

LAURA: There's so many things!

MATT: Twice. Well, it's going to attack you with its club, that's going to be a 17.

TALIESIN: Nope.

MATT: And then it's going to try and slam you with a spike shield. That is 15.

TALIESIN: Nope.

MATT: So that guy starts swinging at you loosely.

TALIESIN: I'm sword out. Yeah.

MATT: All right. Attacking you, Scanlan.

SAM: Oh. Shit.

MATT: The one that's on the ground there. All right. So it has two attacks against you with advantage.

SAM: With advantage?

MATT: Because you're prone. You're on the ground. That'll be a 24 to hit.

SAM: Yeah, yeah, okay.

MATT: And the spike shield is going to be a 24 again, actually.

LAURA: Oh no!

MATT: So as you're on the ground, it slams you with a shield for 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

SAM: Okay.

LAURA: Why didn't I bring Trinket?

SAM: I know! What's wrong with you?

MATT: The shield slams you for eight points of piercing damage. So a total of 20 points of damage as (whack) slams you into the ground twice.

LAURA: I thought this was a stealthing mission!

MATT: It was until he rolled a 15 stealth.

SAM: Blame me, blame me.

MATT: Those wyverns are too far away for combat. The other guys are just assisting the scenario here.

LIAM: Percy shot at them.

MATT: Okay. There's one fellow over here that is a bit far away who steps off. Instead of holding the same clubs and shields or other various hack weapons, he's carrying a gnarled staff.

SAM: Oh, shit.

MATT: Steps forward and sees the weapon that you fired twice and had been fixing, this large metallic dangerous entity, looks forward and begins hissing under his breath (hissing gibberish).

SAM: Do I see this?

MATT: You do.

SAM: I'm going to release my–

MATT: Though you are being slammed on the ground. I'd say make a perception check, actually, to see if you see this.

SAM: Okay.

MATT: Because you are currently–

SAM: 19!

MATT: Yes, actually, I will say you do see this.

SAM: I will release my Counterspell.

MATT: Okay!

SAM: I assume he's casting something.

MATT: He is, actually–

TRAVIS: Or has a terrible cold.

SAM: And I will– I will sing at him, (singing) And you still haven't hit what you're aiming for!

MATT: That's a second-level spell, it is dispelled immediately. As he'd attempted to Heat Metal on your weapon, you can see as the metal begins to glow for a moment and you could feel the heat welling in your hand, all of a sudden the spell (crack) is shattered, like the sound of thin glass in the distance as Scanlan shouts to intercept its arcane ability. That is going to end their opening turn. That brings us down to the initiative order. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Oh, I think Grog was before me.

MATT: Oh, right, Grog, you're holding your action first.

TRAVIS: Right. Can I barrel down through the alley now that someone's on the ground, and race towards the one that's nearest Percy?

MATT: I'll say sure. Usually, going forward, if you hold your action, that's just your action, not your movement, you still move to the situation, but I'll let it stand for this, it's fine.

TRAVIS: I'll remember that going forward.

MATT: Yeah. So you're going to tear down to this guy there?

TRAVIS: Yeah. I would like– and I would like to swing twice with Craven.

MATT: Go for it. Still maintaining your bonuses from last game, by the way. You haven't taken a short rest yet.

LAURA: Oh my gosh!

TRAVIS: Yes indeed.

LAURA: He's so strong from the last game.

TRAVIS: Plus– That's 26.

MATT: 26 hits.

TRAVIS: And a 14 on the second one.

MATT: 14 does not hit. This is the Great Weapon Master?

TRAVIS: No, these are regular attacks.

LAURA: You didn't rage yet?

MATT: Did you rage?

TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh! No, I did not.

MATT: Do you want to rage as part of your bonus action to this?

TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

MATT: Okay. Figures. All right, so as your bonus action you go into a rage before you strike. Go for it.

TRAVIS: 12– 22? Oh, wait. Yep, 22.

MATT: 22 damage. All right. The second strike missed.

TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. 22, that's it.

MATT: 22. So you rush forward, slam the sword into the side of the lizard creature. It puts its shield up and it manages to block most of the blow, but it still slides off and slams into part of its neck area. It shoves the blade out. However, it fails its save.

TRAVIS: Yes!

MATT: Take a strength point off of it and add that to what you have now. What's your strength currently?

TRAVIS: 22.

MATT: So it goes up another plus one to attack and damage. If it became 22, it does.

TRAVIS: Yes.

MATT: All right. Grog, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Is there anywhere I can stand that I get a good cone shape? Or am I all blocked in?

MATT: You can try to move through. You might get an attack of opportunity from the guy that's attacking Grog.

LAURA: Okay, how high is the roof next to me?

MATT: It's about 16, 20 feet.

LAURA: Could I acrobatics that shit up?

MATT: You could try to. Go for it.

LAURA: Okay.

LIAM: Parkour!

LAURA: Hold on. Oh! 31?

MATT: With that, you look over and see the rooftop up there. You leap off each side, Ninja Gaiden-style. Hop onto the rooftop with a solid view of the entire battlefield before you, including the one flying creature up there.

LAURA: Oh, okay. Then I'm going to Hunter's Mark the magic user.

MATT: All righty.

LAURA: And I'm going to Conjure Barrage in a cone to get as many of those fucks as I can.

MATT: Okay, so it's a 60-foot cone. Right there?

LAURA: Yeah, sure. Sorry, Scanlan.

MATT: You will hit Scanlan, as well.

SAM: Oh, balls! I'm a little man!

MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll for that.

LAURA: 3d8.

MATT: Yeah, roll 3d8 damage.

SAM: 3d8 damage?

MATT: Yeah!

LAURA: It's not that much. 16, and then an extra d6 on that guy. An extra six.

MATT: Okay, so does he make his save? He does not.

SAM: Do I have to make a save?

MATT: Yes, you do.

SAM: What kind of save?

MATT: This would be a dexterity saving throw.

SAM: And I'm on the ground. That's a nine.

MATT: You take 16 points of damage from that. That's a fail, and a success. So 16. The wyvern makes that, so half that for eight. He fails. All right, cool. Got it. So as you go forward, leaping up on top, you mark the one guy, turn around, and release a torrent of arrows that sprays into the center of this open pathway of the city. I believe that ends your turn.

LAURA: Yes, it does.

MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.

SAM: Oh, me?

MATT: Yep.

SAM: Balls. Shit. I'm on the ground. If I stand up, that's my action?

MATT: It's half your movement.

SAM: That's half my movement. Okay, I'll stand up. He doesn't get to hit me, right?

MATT: Not unless you move away from him.

SAM: Okay. Which riders are still on their beasts?

MATT: These two are the only two that are still on their beasts.

SAM: I will ignore the guy next to me and I will Hand Cone it up, and I will– he's got two riders?

MATT: Yeah, they have these ramshackle– you can see now with a closer look, these leather kind of saddles? But they're mostly thrown leathers that are strapped to its back, and there's two of them holding onto these knobs in front to stay on.

SAM: Two riders?!

LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

SAM: I guess I'll Dominate one of them. The main guy.

LAURA: Can you Dominate the beast?

SAM: He's not a person.

MATT: There's Dominate Person and Dominate Monster. They're two different things.

SAM: I'm going to dominate the guy in front.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Maverick, not Hollywood.

TRAVIS: It's Maverick and Goose!

SAM: Well, at the end, it was Hollywood.

TRAVIS: No, it was Merlin.

SAM: Merlin?!

TRAVIS: Yeah. Tim Robbins.

SAM: Merlin was the teacher, the guy who spun out. Hollywood was the guy who was his–

TRAVIS: You don't want to do this with me.

TALIESIN: This is the first conversation I've ever been in in this group where I feel young.

MATT: The rider's screeching down while it's holding on, and all of a sudden it shakes its head for a minute and looks down at you, eyes connected, and you know that this entity is waiting for its command.

SAM: Can I only give it one command per turn?

MATT: You can give it a basic command and it will follow it through, unless you wanted to directly control it.

SAM: Well, I've got two things to do. He's got to get rid of that fucker on his back, and also other things. Let's go for the big kahuna. I command him to ride his beast to attack the one below him. The wyvern below him.

MATT: Okay. All right, good to know. And do you want to stay where you are? Do you want to move?

SAM: No, I don't want to move because he'll hit me. That would be bad. Who hasn't gone? You haven't gone.

TALIESIN: Vax hasn't gone–

SAM: Vax hasn't gone? Oh my god.

LAURA: No. because he rolled a one, remember?

LIAM: Yup!

SAM: Okay. I will inspire Vax with my inspiration. And I will say: This is ground control to Major Vax, you've really made the blade. And the papers want to know whose blood you spilled!

MATT: (laughs) All right, take your d10 inspiration die.

LIAM: d10. Yes.

SAM: Rest in peace.

MATT: All right. That's Scanlan's turn. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: So I'm having trouble seeing the battle map. Grog is right against a wyvern, right?

MATT: Grog is against a lizard-like creature–

LIAM: Oh, so not against a wyvern?

MATT: No. That's a little bit away. But Percy is next to it.

LIAM: Oh, so Percy is right there?

MATT: Correct, yes.

LIAM: And Scanlan's next to the magic user, right?

MATT: The magic user's over here, that's been Hunter's Marked.

LIAM: Scanlan's up against a dude, right? All right, so what I want to do is slink up behind Percy, reach over– oh, no, I want to click my Boots of Haste, is what I want to do.

MATT: Did you use them during the battle against the looters?

LIAM: I don't think so.

TRAVIS: I don't remember him doing it.

LIAM: No, I didn't. No I didn't, I definitely didn't, because I remember kicking myself for– I definitely didn't. Okay so, click, everybody starts moving slower around me. I want to– so Percy's against the wyvern, I want to reach over Percy's shoulder and stab the wyvern, and then I want to throw another dagger at the dude standing next to Scanlan.

MATT: On this side there, you mean?

LIAM: Yeah. Well, I can't tell, I can't see shit– is that over Percy's shoulder?

MATT: Because right now you're being blocked, you can't quite get to the wyvern unless you move around the building that you left.

LIAM: But I can go around it, yes, let's do that. I'm going to stab the wyvern in the butt, and then I'm going to throw a dagger from my other hand at the guy standing next to Scanlan– I've got a question for you. Because both of them have somebody who's running interference, do I get sneak attack damage on both?

MATT: You only get one sneak attack damage per turn.

LIAM: Just per turn?

MATT: Once per turn.

LIAM: All right. So I'm going to use sneak attack damage on the wyvern if I get it.

MATT: Go for it! So first strike against it, as you (whoosh) whip around the side of the building, blades out–

LIAM: 25!

MATT: That hits!

LIAM: And then for the dude by Scanlan gets a– word, 19.

MATT: Yep. If you have both blades out, you get a third attack too, don't forget.

LIAM: I do. Oh– yes. So the third stab will go back at the wyvern.

MATT: Okay! So the sneak attack against the wyvern, first strike.

LIAM: Yeah, and the last one was a 24 total, so that hits as well. Okay! So that's two, one, yes. That's 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29 into the wyvern.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: And then the jerk over by Scanlan gets seven.

SAM: Yes!

LIAM: And then the wyvern takes another, the Keen Dagger, takes another nine.

MATT: All righty. So, as you rush around, you stab the wyvern on the back of its haunches and you see it shrieks in pain (screeches), looks over its shoulder and starts biting its tail, its stinger swinging about, but you avoid it, fling the other dagger to the side and then jam the other side of its haunches with your other hand. It's definitely aware of your presence now.

LIAM: Did I use up all my movement?

MATT: Nope!

LIAM: Knowing that it can swat at me, I'm going to try to go right back around where I came from.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: And I'm wearing the Cloak of Displacement.

MATT: Okay. It's going to swing at you with disadvantage.

SAM: Just call it cloak number seven.

MATT: That's a two on the first roll, so yeah. That misses you. (whoosh) Its stinger swings out towards you and you duck underneath, it slams to the side of the building, breaking part of the wood, you can see splinters fly out to the middle of the road. That ends your turn?

LIAM: Yeah.

MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Okay. How far away am I from this guy, like– roughly how many feet?

MATT: Roughly–

MARISHA: The guy who's in the air, flying.

MATT: I'd say about 60, 65 feet.

MARISHA: Beautiful. I want to move up and around– here-ish.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: Sorry, I've got this thing in the way. Back a little bit– scoot back. Is that still in your path?

SAM: No, he's my guy.

MARISHA: He's your–? Oh. Well, I'm not going to fuck with him. I'm going to– you Dominated the guy?

SAM: I Dominated the guy.

MARISHA: Should I turn the wyvern into something else?

SAM: I don't know. I don't know.

MARISHA: Should I Polymorph him? Yeah, I guess he's Dom– you are Dominating that guy. Is there anything else that's flying? He's the only one that's up in the air left, right?

MATT: Yeah, all the other wyverns have landed and let their riders off on the sides.

MARISHA: So you commanded him to attack the one below you, right? I'm going to turn that wyvern into a– chicken!

MATT: This one?

MARISHA: Yes!

MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

MARISHA: Poof! He has to make a wisdom save.

MATT: That is a seven!

MARISHA: Fail!

MATT: And with that– (laughs) The wyvern– (laughs) Twice now–

MARISHA: (laughs) This is my favourite game, you guys!

MATT: The bane of wyverns everyone– (swoop, chicken noise). As both the riders tumble off, slamming into the ground (sound of impact). That would be– Okay, ten points of damage to the wyvern, which kills the chicken form entirely. It turns back to a wyvern on the ground, taking the excess three damage.

LAURA: Yeah– (laughs) Keyleth.

MARISHA: Fuck.

LAURA: Shit! (laughs)

MATT: What?

SAM: Do I keep hold of my guy?

MATT: The riders fall also, they both take an additional 14 points of damage to each of them from the fall.

MARISHA: They all took damage– and they're on the ground now.

MATT: Let's see if it takes damage and makes a new saving throw against the spell. Does not make it, so it is still Dominated.

SAM: Oh. Okay. Thank God.

MARISHA: I didn't fuck it up this time.

MATT: But they are all– all three of them are considered prone for now. They are all knocked prone.

MARISHA: Cool. That's my turn.

MATT: All right, ends Keyleth's turn. At the top, Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: Okay. Where am I, I can't see–

MATT: You're right here, you're blocked in between the two buildings, the mouth of the alleyway, with a wyvern and lizard creature right there, standing before you.

TALIESIN: Okay, I have no advantage on any of these bastards at the moment if I were to attack. Okay, that's fine. And how would you describe– these are like scaly people?

MATT: This up close and personal, they are humanoid in build, they have, you know, stand up upright, they have long tails, ridges across the head, they're bigger than an actual human and they're very muscular, and the more you look at it, you can see that their clothing, they have tattered cloth and leathers that have been haphazardly dyed in blood and gore to all be a very, very deep red color. And they're pretty uniform across what they are wearing.

LAURA: They're an army.

SAM: Team colors.

TALIESIN: I think you've got that one guy covered at the moment, so I'll concentrate on the–hmm. Tough call, tough call. You know what, I'll have a little fun. I'm going to pull my sword and I'm going to take a slash at the guy who's involved with–

MATT: All right, go for it.

TALIESIN: That's 21.

MATT: 21 hits.

TALIESIN: Oh shit, I forgot to use my bonus action. Can I pop in a quick bonus before that?

MATT: For what?

TALIESIN: Hex him.

MATT: You've already hexed today. You used it in the battle versus the looters.

TALIESIN: Oh, it's–

SAM: Same day.

TALIESIN: That's right. Still the same hour. It can only do it once a day, right? That's all right. That's fine, I can just do a little thing. So, just add to this, would he be described in anywhere on his little D&D card as something with a dragon keyword?

MATT: Nope!

TALIESIN: So I'm just going to do normal damage to him?

MATT: Yes.

TALIESIN: Okay. So–

MATT: Wyverns, however–

TALIESIN: All right, just checking. I'm going to do nine points of damage, slashing damage, to him.

MATT: All righty.

TALIESIN: And I'm going to turn to the wyvern, and take two slashes at the wyvern.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: First is– ew. 14?

MATT: 14 hits.

TALIESIN: Wow.

MATT: They're sacks of hit points, but they don't have lot of armor to them.

TALIESIN: That's 19 plus– 26 points of damage.

MATT: Nice!

TALIESIN: And second shot– 13, 24, yeah, that hits. Ten, 17, 18, 19, 26 points of damage.

MATT: 26 twice in a row. So with this you pull the sword out, as soon as you see it in the proximity of the wyvern, the blade itself almost seems to shimmer with this gleam of green on it, like the metal almost seems to bend and wave with your movements. And as you turn back around to slash at the wyvern, the blade cuts through it like butter, there's not even resistance, it goes right through its flesh. With each slash of the longsword, you can see large chunks of its muscle coming visible as parts of its body are now being pulled from the muscle and sinew. It shrieks in pain, you can see it angrily now starting to get ready to rake at you pretty heavily. That end your turn?

TALIESIN: That's my turn.

MATT: All righty. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to continue where I started on, shitfucker out in front of me.

MATT: Okay! (laughs)

TRAVIS: But I would like to go Great Weapon Master and I would like to use Reckless Attack.

MATT: Go for it.

LAURA: Wow, wow. Wow.

SAM: Reckless.

MATT: Roll your first attack against him.

TRAVIS: That's a 31.

MATT: Roll damage on that.

TRAVIS: 25?

MATT: 25? He fails his save, so you get another plus one to your strength, and that swing just cleaves it in two. It goes (whoosh) right through its midsection, it (gurgles). It tumbles off, falling to the ground.

LAURA: Oh my god. Grog.

LIAM: Grog is full juicing.

TRAVIS: I told you he'd open up to me!

(laughter)

MATT: You can move in now with your movement and do your next attack, if you'd like.

TRAVIS: I'll go ahead and take care of that wyvern that's next to me.

MATT: Go for it, all right, so now you get your next attack.

TRAVIS: Natural 20.

MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

LIAM: Does his strength go up to 100 eventually?

MATT: It's double your first dice roll–

TRAVIS: 19– oh, so the 2d6 was nine, plus five is–

MATT: So 18.

TRAVIS: Plus 11.

MATT: So 29, plus two additional die rolls.

TRAVIS: Ten.

MATT: Okay. So we're at–

MATT, TRAVIS AND MARISHA: 39.

MATT: And then one more? Because you roll 2d– it's twice, because of Brutal Critical.

LIAM: Jeez, you got like Tetsuo arm, it's like five times bigger than it should be.

TRAVIS: Four. Four for those two, do I plus five to that as well for the–

MATT: Well, plus ten for your– you already added that for your–

TRAVIS: Yes, 2d6 plus five on each one and the–

MATT: No, it's just the additional 2d6 each time.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: So yeah, with that you turn around after hacking its friend, leaping forward (grunts), foam at the corner of your mouth, your eyes bloodshot and angry. You take the blade and sweep it down, and it plunges itself right into the wound that Percy had left open with his sword swing, finding no resistance before it comes all the way to the hilt in the body of the wyvern, which shrieks for a moment (screeches) before its breath stops and its body falls limp.

SAM: Yeah, one down!

MATT: Does make its save, though.

TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, and on Great Weapon Master on a crit or killing an extra hit, but I guess I–?

MATT: As a bonus action! For the record, going forward, if you're frenzied raging it doesn't really give you a benefit, but if you're not, it does help. So in theory, you could if you wanted to try and chuck it.

TRAVIS: (laughs) Just throw it? Don't throw it?

MATT: What are you going to do, Grog?

TRAVIS: I'm good, I'm good.

MATT: Ends Grog's turn. All right. Now these guys both get up, currently no longer on the wyvern. Did you want to give it another kind of a thought, if you see it land?

SAM: Get on the wyvern and kill the other one.

MATT: Okay. This guy gets up on the wyvern, grabs its reins, pulls it forward, and jams it with its spear as it leads it inward. It runs forward and is going to take a swing– It's going to take a swing with its stinger at the one behind it. It's confused and figuring out what's– why is it doing this, it's more of like– this might work once. That is going to be a– 17, it hits! That's going to be 11 points of damage, does it make its save? It does not make its save, that's an additional 24 points of poison damage on that one. So that's 35 points of damage, one wyvern to another. (laughs) As this guy immediately whips around angrily.

SAM: You have pleased me.

(laughter)

MATT: Both of these guys go charging forward here.

LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan!

MATT: It's going to pull up its javelin and chuck it at you, Vex.

LAURA: Me?

MATT: Yeah. That is going to miss you at a 12. It (swoosh) throws, the javelin arcs past you. This one over here is going to come forward and it's going to take a javelin as well out and chuck it right at you, Grog.

TRAVIS: Heh, you're dead.

MATT: That is a 20 to hit.

TRAVIS: Hits.

MATT: You take ten points of piercing damage, reduced to five, as you basically (impact)–

TRAVIS: (snapping noise)

MATT: (laughs) Snap it off and grin in its face.

TRAVIS: Let me return that favor in a second.

LIAM: Grog is on god mode.

MARISHA: (laughs) Save game plus.

MATT: (laughs) –now it sees the danger that you're in, looks at you, sees you hack through the center of one of the wyverns, intensely looks at you and begins casting another spell.

TRAVIS: Oh shit.

MATT: Like it is wont to do.

MARISHA: Is it?

TRAVIS: Come on, smart Grog.

MATT: All right. So, Craven Edge, as you're holding it, all of a sudden the handle becomes white hot and you immediately take six points of fire damage just holding it.

SAM: Grip it harder! (groan)

MATT: Fire's biting through. Three attacks against you, Scanlan.

SAM: Oh, God.

MATT: Currently two of which are flanking you, so they're going to have advantage on the attacks. So that's a natural 20 on one of them. This guy is– 18. That hits. And then this guy here without the advantage– still hits with a 17.

SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words on the last guy.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: I'm going to just– (plays flute badly) to distract him.

MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a d10.

SAM: d10. Which one's ten, I never remember. This one. Nine!

MATT: Okay! So he rolled a 17 plus seven, that would've been a 24, that brings him to 15, which I believe misses you. So the last strike, as he swings towards you, the shrilling tones, it causes him to reach up and grab one of his lizard-like ear holes and (snarling) the swing goes wildly over your head. However, as you duck down, you look up as you see the shadow come down of two large clubs that (boom boom) over the head of your tiny gnomish form. That's going to be– (groans)

SAM: Oh, that's not a good sound.

MATT: Oh, and they also get bites after this, too. All right, so you take 12, which would double to 24– Oh, no, sorry, 12– 20 points of bludgeoning damage from one. You take 12 points of damage from the other. So 32 points of damage total. And they're both going to attempt to bite you as well, with advantage.

SAM: A bite with advantage!

MATT: That is a 20 on the first one.

SAM: That's the damage it does?

MATT: That's to hit. And that one's going to – double 19, so they both hit. So you take another 20 points of damage total of piercing damage as they both start tearing into your body.

LAURA: 52 points of damage just then?

SAM: (rasping breath)

LAURA: No, Scanlan!

MARISHA: No, you're still up, you're still up! I thought you said you had 55!

SAM: I did.

LAURA: 52!

MARISHA: It was 52 total.

LAURA: You have three points left.

SAM: Ah! That was close, guys. I saw my mother! Then I saw myself at math class, failing.

MATT: I need you to make a bunch of concentration checks here.

SAM: Oh yeah. Okay.

MATT: To maintain control over it, yeah.

SAM: Advantage on concentration checks.

MATT: Yeah, so just roll two at a time.

SAM: Two whats?

MATT: Two d20s.

SAM: Well, I only have one d20.

MATT: Adding your constitution modifier to it.

SAM: How many– oh, for each thing that– constitution modifier. Holy God. Okay. I'm counting both of those, the first one's only 12.

MATT: 12, that'll work, because none of them– only one of them did 20 damage and it's minimum of ten, so as long as you get above a ten with each one, you're fine.

SAM: Okay. So I got to do two more?

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: Yeah, that's 16 plus two.

MATT: Okay. Another one.

SAM: 17 plus two.

MATT: Another one.

SAM: Two plus two.

MATT: You have advantage on these.

SAM: Seven plus two. Nine.

MATT: Nine. Nope.

SAM: No good. No bueno.

MATT: With that, you lose your concentration on the Domination spell. As that fades–

LAURA: That's okay. The other wyvern is still mad at the first one, so that's good.

MATT: So that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Oh man. Okay.

MATT: You see Scanlan being tossed around on the ground, and then you see streaks of blood in the air as one of them tears a big chunk out of his shoulder.

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: He looks up at you briefly, his eyes half-open.

LAURA: Scanlan! I got you!

SAM: No, no, I know you did. You shot me on the last turn, I remember. Yeah, you got me good! You got me good!

LAURA: I shoot from my Bow of the Sky Sentinel.

MATT: Sky Sentinel, I believe, did you use that last battle?

LAURA: Fuck.

MATT: I'm pretty sure you did.

LAURA: I did, but I only used my burning thingy once, so I can do that. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to one of the guys around Scanlan.

MATT: Okay. Do you want to say the most wounded of them?

LAURA: Yeah, sure.

MATT: That would be–

LAURA: Or the least wounded of them, actually.

MATT: The least wounded would be this one.

LAURA: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot– I'm going to shoot arrows.

MATT: All right!

LAURA: All right. I'm going to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring on that guy and the guy in front of him.

MATT: Okay. Right there and there?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: So Blazing Bowstring, and then regular. Go for it.

LAURA: Okay. So I forget how to do that. I roll to attack. Why is this so hard?! Okay, 18!

MATT: 18 hits.

LAURA: Okay, I'm going to roll damage on that one, which is ten plus my normal eight. 12, 14 plus six for Hunter's Mark. 20 plus six for sneak attack, bitch!

LIAM: Did you just call the DM a bitch?

LAURA: No, I was calling that guy a bitch.

SAM: Matt does not deserve that kind of language.

LAURA: 6d6. So that's 25 damage against the first guy.

MATT: 25 damage? That's just enough. Say goodbye to him. That sneak attack was just what you needed, that was the last bit of damage.

LAURA: Yay! Okay, so the second guy is another 18.

MATT: Another 18? That hits.

LAURA: Actually no, that's a 20-whatever. Yeah. Okay. 14, 15, 16. Do I get sneak attack on him, too?

MATT: Can only sneak attack once per turn.

LAURA: Dang it. So 16 damage against that guy.

MATT: 16 damage, okay. So this arrow– The first one hits it in the neck and he gurgles and falls to the ground and bleeds out on the floor next to Scanlan. The other one, the arrow strikes it in the middle of its shoulderblades and it arcs up in pain, but it's still standing. Though it's having to really move around with much pain in its face. That end your turn? You going to stay up there?

LAURA: I'm going to– yeah.

MATT: Staying up on the rooftop, sniping down. Good call. That brings us to Scanlan!

SAM: It's my turn?!

LAURA: Take a potion! Heal yourself!

SAM: Oh yeah! If I had a potion, that would be great! I will do Thunderwave– Thunderwave at third level.

MATT: Thunderwave at third level, all righty.

LIAM: Dissention in the ranks.

MATT: (laughs) Okay, so that is 4d8 thunder damage to all the ones on a failed save. So, their constitution saves here. Is this through a hand cone?

SAM: Sure, man.

MATT: Figured– both fail!

SAM: What is it, 4d8?

MATT: It's 4d8 thunder damage. They are pushed ten feet away from you.

SAM: Did they all fail? Did they both fail?

MATT: Yes. This pushed this way. This pushed that way.

SAM: Ten. 17!

MATT: 17 points of damage to each. Okay! They're blasted backward, barely catching themselves on their feet. And from the impact, you can see what little bit of red-colored leather armor they have on is tattered and destroyed. You can see blood pouring out of the sides of their earholes where the thunderous blast possibly burst their eardrums. And they're both like, shaking their head. All right.

SAM: Bonus action, I will Healing Word myself–

MATT: (laughing) Okay.

SAM: I can do that at higher levels? Yes?

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: I'll do it at a level four.

MATT: (laughing) Okay.

SAM: And I will sing to myself; sadly, pathetically, (breathy) I get knocked down, but I get up again. Ain't never going to keep me down.

(laughter)

MATT: All right! So that is 4d4 plus five healing to yourself.

SAM: Okay, 4d4 plus five– That's 14 plus five.19.

MATT: 19. So you heal yourself 19 hit points. That ends your turn. Up next, Vax.

LIAM: I'm going to scramble up to the top of the building that I'm right next to.

MATT: Acrobatics check.

LIAM: Sure. No problem. Yeah, way high. 20– 33.

MATT: Yeah. You parkour up the side, land on top of the rooftop. Leap across and you're now at the edge.

LIAM: Is that Percy right there?

MATT: That's Percy right there.

LIAM: Okay. Oh, who's right directly in a row, away from me? Yeah, I can't tell. It's a bad guy?

MATT: It's a bad guy, bad guy. Bad guy, bad guy, bad guy.

LIAM: I want to run, actually, and I want to jump off and land next to Percy. Yeah. I want to run straight by and I want to stab the dude. I'm going to run forward, yeah. Stab that guy.

(laughter)

LIAM: Yeah, exactly. That is 20.

MATT: That hits, roll damage.

SAM: Run, run, run. Stab. Run, run, run. Stab. Those are the two buttons on the Vax video game.

(laughter)

SAM: Run and stab.

LIAM: Nine.

MATT: Nine damage?

LIAM: Yeah.

MATT: (grunt) You shank him in the side and he tumbles over.

(cheering)

LIAM: Run towards Scanlan, and I want to grapple him. Hopefully he just takes it. No, not that far. One square back. Right there! Grab him. And I'm using my bonus action to dash and then drag him backward, behind Grog.

MATT: It's an action to grapple someone who would be against it, are you letting him grapple you?

SAM: Oh, hell yes.

MATT: I'll say for the sake of the–

LIAM: Right, two actions and a bonus action, mix them around, Matt!

MATT: Yeah, it's fine, because he wants to. You rush forward, you grab him, and you're dragging him back this way?

LIAM: And then back– yeah, right behind Grog, and I drag him behind Vex and Grog, back by Keyleth. (airplane noise)

MATT: Okay. I'll say that's about as far as you get because you have a bit of movement taken away, even though you are hasted, because he's not too heavy, but he's still a gnome.

LIAM: Right. Dash– hasted, I can go very very far.

SAM: Your hands are so rough and masculine.

LIAM: I spank him on the ass and say, you're welcome, shorty.

MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to push my way through the crowd a little bit. Can I have that laser pointer?

LIAM: Yes, you may.

MARISHA: Thank you. Okay. (grandiose voice) And now with all of the rage, thinking about all–

SAM: “I turn someone into a chicken.”

MARISHA: I– boof! Boof! Boof! I want some feather-down pillows for our loft. I channel all of my Fire Ashari ancestors. And I cast my 7th-level Firestorm!

SAM: Oh god, we're all going to die.

MARISHA: So as I concentrate, enraged at the sight of dragons, I have ten–

SAM: (whispers) Did you get me away from– because I–

MARISHA: Yes, you're fine. You're fine. No, he didn't get you away because he knew this was happening, it just happened to work out. So ten ten-foot cubes– They all have to be connected. Exactly, I'm going to start here and I'll work my way over. They're ten-foot– remember, they're ten-foot. But they're attached. So they're bigger than that.

MATT: Three– well, they're ten foot by ten foot, which is about this size.

MARISHA: Okay, okay.

MATT: Right, so it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

MARISHA: Oh, okay, yeah, get the wyvern.

MATT: You can get all of them there.

LAURA: Oh my god, that guy is going to be so–

LIAM: Grog's going to bite his head off.

MATT: What's the DC on this?

MARISHA: They have to make a dex saving throw or they take–

MATT: Right, right, but what's your DC on it?

MARISHA: Oh, my spell DC? 19.

MATT: Fail, fail, fail, they're not very dextrous. Fail, fail, fail– Fail! They all fail.

(cheering)

MATT: So that's 7d10 fire damage to each of them.

SAM: Why don't you use that all the time!?

MARISHA: I just got it! I just got it when I leveled.

LIAM: You've got to be careful with friendly fire, and we're all out of the way.

MARISHA: So a giant, fiery chasm splits open.

MATT: The ground bursts open, rocks being torn asunder as giant columns of flame– boof, boof, boof, boof, boof– out of the ground, completely engulfing each one of them in this sudden conflagration of red and orange and yellow flames and molten magma.

MARISHA: 24. 24, that was four– 24, that's good, so 27, 36, 30– 42 points of fire damage.

(clapping)

LIAM: Phew. Gingers, man. Gingers.

MARISHA: My hands light up.

MATT: Each one of the lizardfolk-type creatures in the flames, you see them shriek for a second before their forms are turned to ash in these blasts of fire, each sub-woofer-like, guttural impact as the ground cracks open like (explosion noise) scatter amongst–

MARISHA: So they explode? Popcorn?

MATT: Yeah, each one of the wyverns themselves, you can see the flames emerge around them, and as it recedes they have burn scars and their flesh is cracked and peeled against the fire wounds that now tear across the front of their body. They're all looking fairly hurt by that.

MARISHA: And then, I take a bow.

(laughter)

MARISHA: And I'm– exhausted a little bit, little single tear as I think of my ancestors– And that's it.

MATT: All right, end of your turn. Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to start walking towards that wyvern at the bottom there– Yeah, that way, I'm not going to get quite close enough to get into the reach of that jerk over there–

MATT: So you can go here.

TALIESIN: Yeah. While I'm walking by him, though, I'm going to nail– I don't even know if I'm really going to– going to shoot him three times while I'm walking by, because that's funny. With Sharpshooter.

MATT: Okay. So first shot against them?

TALIESIN: It would be seven, 19.

MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on him.

TALIESIN: That's– 1d10, what did I do with my 1d10s, because I wasn't thinking– here we go. That's 26 points of damage.

MATT: (explosion noise) You take his head right off as you walk by, without even looking. (explosion noise, pained squawk) And you can see the lower jaw gets blown off and it falls to the back on the ground.

TALIESIN: Since I've got two more shots, I'm going to start shooting at that one dragon– that wyvern, as I'm–

MATT: Right there? Go for it. Two shots on the wyvern.

TALIESIN: Sharpshooter again.

MATT: All right.

SAM: Pew!

TALIESIN: That's a nine, yay! So that's 16?

MATT: 16 hits.

TALIESIN: And I'll roll the second one, just to have it. That's nine. Nah, nine'll miss. Thankfully will not– that's great. 26 points of damage.

MATT: All righty. This one (explosion noise) the bullet hits inside of its body, you can see a little (splurting noise) of blood squirt out–

TALIESIN: And I'll get as close as I can get to him in this round, also, I'm going to spend my movement walking straight towards him.

MATT: (heavy walking noises) That's the rest of it there. Okay. That's your turn. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah! I leave one of those to you guys, and I run at the two wyverns on the left.

MATT: Getting in the middle of the fray? Against them both?

TRAVIS: Yeah, against them both!

MATT: There you go! Grog charges, and they're both– There you go!

TRAVIS: Here's hoping these puppies go– That's 24?

MATT: 24 on the more wounded one?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: All right, that hits him.

TRAVIS: Can I swing at the other guy?

MATT: If you want to.

TRAVIS: Yeah, let's divvy it up, I don't want to give anybody too much love. Five, four, 26?

MATT: Hits, so roll damage on each.

TRAVIS: 11, 22, 32?

MATT: They're both Great Weapon Master? Okay, 32 damage?

TRAVIS: 32 on the first.

MATT: First one, you carve through him with the blade (whump).

LAURA: Nice.

MATT: Makes his save.

TRAVIS: Five, ten, 21, 31, 31.

MATT: 31 damage? Okay. This one you (whoosh) streak across with Craven Edge. Makes its save. You leave a large wound across the front of its jaw and it (choking noise). However, you did kill one, so you do get to use your bonus action for an attack because of your Great Weapon Master feat.

TRAVIS: Do I have to roll for the hit?

MATT: Yes.

TRAVIS: That's 31?

MATT: With the minus five?

TRAVIS: Sorry! No, no, never mind, sorry, what's 31 minus five?

LIAM and TALIESIN: 26.

MATT: Hits, yeah, you're good.

TRAVIS: Okay. Three, seven, 12, 30. Oh, 22, 32.

LIAM: He's covered in ichor.

MATT: 32. This time (whoosh) you swipe through the second time with the blade, this time carving off part of its wing, and you see that one of the wings is half-curled and keeping up to the side, it's hobbling around its legs, looking like it's on death's door, but still keeping itself. All right, is that the end of your turn?

TRAVIS: That's it.

MATT: All right, (wyvern noise) in there, and this one stays there and is going to unleash upon you, Grog. It's going to bite and tail attack against each of you with the stinger against you, Grog. That is a 21 to hit?

TRAVIS: Hits.

MATT: And natural 20 on the stinger, okay.

TRAVIS: Well, I have resistance against poison, so that helps.

MATT: That does help, actually, so it'll just do regular poison damage against you. So you take 11 points of piercing damage, reduced to six from the bite. And the stinger deals– That's 12 points of piercing damage, reduced to six as well.

TRAVIS: Okay.

MATT: The stinger, however, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

TRAVIS: All right. Ugh, 12.

MATT: That's a failure. Actually, it would have been an additional 12, because it was a critical hit on the pierce, so you take 12– so a total of 18 damage so far, and then, as part of the poison, you take 48 points of poison damage. Because you have resistance, that is reduced to 24.

SAM: Hey! That's nice!

MATT: All right, you have poison resistance from the belt, right? Yes. All right, so there you go. The other one coming up against you, Percy, strikes with its bite. That is going to be a 20– 16?

TALIESIN: 16 misses.

MATT: 16 misses. That is going to be a 22 for the stinger.

TALIESIN: Stinger hits.

MATT: Okay, stinger hits you for six plus four, ten points of piercing damage. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. 20.

MATT: 20, you succeed. No poison.

TALIESIN: So I took ten points of–?

MATT: Piercing damage. Correct. All right, it's looking rough on both their ends. They're just fighting to the end at this point. All right, that ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the one fighting–

MATT: Moving it over?

LAURA: Yeah. Percy.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: And I'm going to first attack the one fighting Grog.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: 16?

MATT: 16– does hit, yeah.

LAURA: Yes! Okay.

MATT: Don't have a whole lot of armor. They just got a lot of hit points.

LAURA: 17 plus sneak attack– 18.

MATT: 18. So Grog, as you're thrashing about with the blade at this creature, eager to get that final hit, you reach back with Craven Edge before an arrow (impact) into its face and it (burble, thump) collapses to the ground.

TRAVIS: Aw!

(laughter)

LAURA: And I shift my attention over to the one fighting Percy!

MATT: All right.

LAURA: And that is 30, no, 28?

MATT: 28 hits, go ahead and roll damage with the extra d6 for Hunter's Mark.

LAURA: Nine, ten, 11– Where's my dex? 17.

MATT: Gotcha. 17 points of damage. Second you (whoosh) pull out the second arrow, (whoosh) release it and it strikes the side of its body, and (pained squawk) it still seems to be standing. It hurt it, but didn't leave it in any dire straits yet. That ends your turn, are you staying where you are?

LAURA: I'm staying where I am!

MATT: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.

LAURA: Actually, I'm going to jump off the roof and rush over to Scanlan.

MATT: Okay. So leaping off, make an acrobatics check.

LAURA: 24?

MATT: 24– Scanlan, at the start of your turn, as you're getting ready, all of a sudden (impact) in front of you, spooking you momentarily, you see Vex lands on her feet and looks down at you with a look of concern and wanting to make sure you're okay.

SAM: Oh, hi, thanks for checking on me. Could you move for a second? I'm going to kill this thing.

(laughter)

SAM: Oh, so I'll– I can't do much, because I'm far away and I don't want to kill Percy–

TALIESIN: It's not going to live through me anyway.

SAM: That's true. I will Wand of Magic Missiles him.

MATT: Okay, using how many–

SAM: I'll use six of my seven.

MATT: Oof! All righty. So go ahead and roll proper damage on that.

SAM: Okay, the first, okay, so is that 6d4 plus one?

MATT: This would be Magic Missile, cast at level six, technically, I'm pretty sure–

SAM: Well, it's weird, because my–

MATT: So it would be– it would be 6d6 plus six.

SAM: 6d6 plus six?

MATT: Oh, I'm sorry. 6d4 plus six. Bleah.

TRAVIS: (chuckles) Heh, math.

MATT: Hey.

SAM: Sorry, it's close.

LAURA: Yeah.

SAM: One more? 12 plus what? Six? 12 plus six. 18.

MATT: 18? Okay. The missiles (impact noises) slamming into the side, arcing off and swirling around Percy to hit it, anime-missile-streak style, hitting it from all sides, you can see chunks of its body being blown off from the force of the arcane casting. It still stands, though it is dripping from multiple wounds and is having a hard time.

TALIESIN: I got this.

MATT: Ending your turn, Scanlan?

SAM: I think so, I mean, I'm okay. I'll heal myself a little bit more with another level one Healing Word.

MATT: Go for it, take your d4 plus five.

SAM: Okay. Seven more points– yay!

MATT: You're up.

LIAM: I'm going to start walking towards it and dagger, and dagger, and dagger.

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: First is 20.

MATT: 20 hits.

LIAM: Second is 23.

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: Third is a 23.

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: So, we get–

MATT: This is Sneak Attack.

LIAM: Ten for the fir– Sneak Attack? Is it near something?

MATT: Percy is in melee range with it.

LIAM: Okay, so the first is ten plus– wah!

LAURA: Oh no, dice down!

LIAM: Ten plus 16, 23, (growling) 29, 36, 39, 41 for the first dagger.

MATT: How do you want to do this?

(cheering)

LIAM: I will aim for its open mouth as it's going “huah.” And pin its tongue into the back of its skull.

MATT: As you step forward, your first dagger, you pull it out and aim it and over-the-hand toss it as it rears back, ready to bring its fangs out to sink down into Percy, the dagger vanishes into its throat, and you see its face go lax for a second. (wet coughs) It begins trying to cough, and as it does, you can see bits of blood and gore from its throat being hawked across the ground. It takes a few steps. Percy steps out of the way as it heads towards you before it rears back and (choking, thump) and collapses onto the ground. You can see the blade still sticking out the back of its head, towards the back of its throat, before it appears at the side of your belt.

SAM: Sorry I made a noise, guys, sorry.

LAURA: Next time, stealth. We should get inside.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: We should hide.

TALIESIN: We should– we should take what we can and we should also hide the bodies.

LAURA: Good call.

TALIESIN: Let's bring everything inside.

MARISHA: I go down to the wyverns and I start going for those stingers.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: If you can do this quickly, Keyleth, because we need to hide these bodies.

MATT: It's going to take you a while to do it.

LIAM: Can I assist with my Keen Dagger, and help her under her instruction?

LAURA: Let's get them inside.

LIAM: We're going to drag the wyverns indoors?

TALIESIN: Drag everything indoors.

SAM: Wait, wait, wait– these stingers are on the end of tails?

LIAM and TALIESIN: Yeah.

SAM: Grog, can you chop off their tails and we'll take the tails with us?

LAURA: No, we've got to get the wyverns inside. If anything flying overhead sees these bodies, they know something's been attacked.

SAM: Aren't half of them burned to a crisp anyway?

TALIESIN: Not crisped, just scorched.

MARISHA: There's some ash. I go ahead and I do a cantrip, Gust, and start spreading out the ash.

MATT: Okay. It still looks like someone emptied a bunch of fireplace ash pits into the center of the walkway where there once were lizardfolk.

LAURA: I'll have the bag.

TRAVIS: What for?

LAURA: Just the Dust of Tracelessness.

SAM: I give us cover. I'll blow my Horn of Fog.

LAURA: I start putting the Dust of Tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like nobody's been here.

MATT: Low fog sound as Scanlan blows the horn. Fog fills the vicinity and you guys begin tossing Dust of Tracelessness around–

TRAVIS: I go grab the humanoid figures and I throw two over my shoulders and then I get one in each hand and I start dragging them toward a door?

TALIESIN: Any– inside. Just inside.

TRAVIS: To an “any inside.”

LIAM: I'll get the door for you. (door creaks)

MATT: All right, you guys pretty quickly manage to move what you can out of the way, we'll say over the next few minutes the fog is there. Under that cover, you begin to drag the wyvern bodies into the alleyway, into the shadows. If you want to go ahead and make some checks here to go ahead and see if you can harvest.

MARISHA: Yeah, okay, let's do different ones. Okay, so first one, I'll definitely take advantage, so, since I have advantage– not that much better– 14. The first one.

LIAM: Would it help if I gave her my Keen Dagger for the rest of it?

MATT: I would say, given the circumstance, all it would do would offer her advantage, which she already has, so it wouldn't make much difference. So the first one, it's been a little too damaged in battle and you aren't able to really draw any poison from the stinger for the first one– what's the second one?

MARISHA: Second one, 15 total.

MATT: 15's what you needed. You manage to extract just enough of the wyvern stinger poison for possibly a single dose, so you can mark down a dose of wyvern poison.

MARISHA: Okay, I'll give it to– I'll give that to Vax. Do you have poison? Or do you– Vax or Vex– I give it to one of the twins. Here, twins. You fight over it. Fight over it.

LAURA: Is it good for you?

LIAM: Yeah.

MARISHA: Two more, maybe I can– 14– Okay, well, the second one I rolled a 25.

MATT: Okay, so that's a second dose of wyvern poison.

MARISHA: That I give to Vex. Last one– I'll take that 15, with– 26.

MATT: All right, so you have three doses of wyvern poison that you've managed to harvest from these creatures; you guys can distribute as you see fit.

TALIESIN: Anything else to loot from these schmuckuses?

MATT: They don't carry much gold, and what they have, you envision, probably went to the entity that rules Emon. And as you're looking over the bodies of the few of the lizard men here, you see they didn't just wander their way in here. And you remember mention from Allura before that there were lizardfolk worshipers of Thordak years ago. Apparently, once the city's been taken, Thordak has, or at least the worshipers of Thordak are also moving in. So, taking this time to harvest poisons, looking over the bodies, you can see the consistency between their red, crimson-dyed leather materials, and you get the sensation that while this was a small skirmish group, this is probably the new policing state of Emon. So. With that, we'll take a quick break for the restroom. We'll pick up here in just a few minutes, guys, if you want to hang tight. And we'll see you here shortly.
Break
Part II

MATT: Jumping back in– As the party re-gathers themselves after the battle with these lizardfolk and the wyverns in the center of the city of Emon, you slowly make your way back through the streets towards the north, passing through Abdar's Promenade, finding the building that was previously brought to your attention thanks to Garthok.

LAURA: Should we take a short rest, though, before we head down to the Clasp? Because some of us have taken some hits–

TALIESIN: We'll take a breath in the–

LAURA: Okay. Before we head down?

TALIESIN: Yeah. In the basement.

MATT: So you guys find the building that was brought to your attention; you head down into the same cellar, keeping tabs on the external trap that was brought to your attention by Garthok last time. You make your way inside. There's the same barrel in the far corner; you pull the top off and there, indeed, is a ladder that leads down underground.

LAURA: This is why I left Trinket. Because he wouldn't have been able to come down here anyway. Just so you know.

TRAVIS: Hey, search that shit, Vax.

MARISHA: He's very claustrophobic.

LIAM: So we've just got ladder down. That's it?

MARISHA: Well, hang on, let's heal up. I need to hit dice it up as well.

LIAM: Well, I'm fine, so while everybody is–

TRAVIS: I would not like to take a short rest.

LAURA: Oh.

TRAVIS: I lose all my Fancy Feast if I do.

LIAM: Just do some push-ups. Just do some push-ups while I check this ladder out. So I'm going to check for any traps on this ladder or anything.

TRAVIS: Oh, yeah yeah yeah! Can she heal me instead?

LAURA: I'll heal you. I'm going to heal you–

LIAM: 23.

MATT: Okay. Looking at the barrel, there are no traps currently set, and it's not locked. The only traps were on the outside of the cellar, from what you knew previously, and as that mechanism had already been shown to you by Garthok, so that was easily disabled.

LIAM: I'm not going to go crazy, I'm just going to go to the bottom of the ladder– in I go.

MATT: Okay. So while you guys are taking a rest–

LIAM: 30 for stealth.

MATT: You drop down the ladder. As you head down what probably comes to about 15, 20 or so feet into pitch black– it's completely dark down there. Do you have any light source, or do you want to–

LIAM: I have a Flame Tongue Dagger.

MATT: Okay, so you pull the Flame Tongue Dagger. It puts out a very, very low candlelight, opens up the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into very, very shallow, a couple inches, shallow water. Looking around you, you are in a subterranean sewer system. The smell hits you as you hit the bottom of it. This is the entire underbelly of Emon, and there is the slight sound of trickling water that's rushing through this tunnel you're currently standing in. The ladder drops close to about a foot above the floor before it comes to a complete stop. Looking to your right, it descends a little further down on that side, and you can hear– make a perception check.

LIAM: 22.

MATT: Okay. To the right of you, what should be the eastern tunnel, you can hear the sound of trickling water growing louder; it's almost like this stream meets another. As you listen to the left, and the stench is pretty rough in this part, to the left you can see in the tunnel is a very, very faint dim, yellow light that is shifting ever so slightly in the distance as it curves around out of view. It is level to where you are now, actually, slight incline for a little bit.

LIAM: (quietly) Vex'ahlia– There is a long tunnel down here and there is a bit of faint light. I have Percy's fancy rock; I am not planning on doing anything crazy, but I think I should–

LAURA: You don't have the– the rock doesn't work until we sleep. You don't have anything.

LIAM: Well, technically I do still have it. Regardless, I should go ahead and, if there's anyone to talk to, I should talk– I'm not going to go yet, I'm going to wait 'til you guys have rested, and come down to– it's pitch-black down here, I'm not running ahead. I'm better at this shit than you and the rest are, so take a rest, I'm going to sit here–

LAURA: You're better at talking than the rest of us are?

LIAM: Sometimes, Stubby, yes.

LAURA: How will I know if you get into trouble, and your hands are tied–

SAM: Do you need me to come?

LAURA: We can all hear you.

(laughter)

LIAM: Stubby, could you come down here for me?

MARISHA: Hi, Vax.

LAURA: Hold on just a moment. Mind the gap.

MATT: You splash down into the sewer system.

LAURA: Eugh, fuck, it smells down here.

LIAM: Yeah.

LAURA: Do I have to step in the water?

LIAM: Probably. Come here.

LAURA: Yes?

LIAM: All right so, before all these guys– you were being stalked by someone, I don't know for what reason, I don't know who the person was, I don't know what they wanted with you.

LAURA: Stalked?

LIAM: Someone wanted you, and I don't know who. The Clasp was going to get you for them, and I stopped that from happening. I followed you one night, or rather, followed this person following you, and met the Clasp. And I made an exchange for your life.

LAURA: What?

LIAM: I went and got someone else. And–

LAURA: And said it was me? No–

LIAM: Not immediately. You're almost on it. They told me to get a body, I got a body. A living body. A child rapist. And brought him to the Clasp, and they brought out a stick– really it was made of human tongues.

LAURA: A stick. Of human tongues.

LIAM: Yes. They touched it, and he turned into you.

LAURA: What the fuck?

LIAM: And they took that guy. For whatever. And in exchange for your life, I have this, and they are allowed to call on me when they want. So, I know that we've run in and out a couple of times, but we're going in. You can talk my fucking ear off in a moment, all right? Just shut up for a second. We are going to go in and try to form some sort of alliance or working partnership, this is different than running in, smashing some shit and running out, all right? So keep the cloak up, hang back, don't say a lot, and you can talk my ear off later.

LAURA: Okay, I will do that, I want to know that tongue guy, that looks like me– is he dead or is he alive now? They gave him to some stalker, some stalker!

LIAM: I don't know why you were wanted, I don't know what it was about, all I knew is that they were going to take you away and I wasn't going to let that happen and I took some fucking piece of shit and traded him in.

LAURA: So there could be at this moment in time another person that looks just like me parading around the world?

LIAM: Well, if I had to wager on it, I'd say that he's in a dungeon in a rubber suit, but I don't know where, no.

LAURA: Well, thank you. For, you know, doing that– (nervous laugh)

LIAM: I never told you because it's creepy as fuck.

LAURA: Was it the Clasp here, was it the Clasp in Westruun?

LIAM: It was in Westruun.

LAURA: Well, these guys probably don't know me.

LIAM: Probably? Probably.

LAURA: I'll put my hood up–

LIAM: Stay at the back.

LAURA: I would like to find out who the guy was that wanted me, though. That's kind of weird. Thank you. For everything. thank you. You always have my back and I know it.

LIAM: Yeah.

LAURA: And for that, I won't say very much.

LIAM: You do you, Vex'ahlia.

LAURA: Everyone can come down.

MATT: So as you finish your short rest, you all progressively find your way down the ladder and to the subterranean sewer system. The choice is to travel to the east or western side of the tunnel.

LIAM: Sounds like there's, I don't know, drainage or something coming from slightly up in that direction.

LAURA: I'm guessing towards the light, is where they are. Scanlan?

SAM: Oi?

LAURA: Do you have something that can make disguises? Don't you have like, not the mustache, but something that can really change my looks?

SAM: How do you know I'm Scanlan? I could be in disguise, but yes I do.

LAURA: Could I use that?

SAM: You would have to attune it to yourself– is that right?

LAURA: Oh, it takes like a little bit?

SAM: Oh no no no, requires attunement. What do you think?

LIAM: Well, that's not a bad idea, but it means we've got to sit in this stank.

SAM: I can instantly make us, with Seeming, I can instantly make us all look different.

Or just you.

LAURA: Or just me. How about just me? I've got a question, though. Here's the thing: if you think that they know what I look like, don't you think they know what you look like? Because you look just like me. So what difference does it make if I'm there or not?

LIAM: I don't know if the person who wanted you was part of the Clasp. I don't know who it was. It's parading you around in front of the people who made an illicit deal with me.

LAURA: All right, all right, all right. Seeming, how about that?

LIAM: It could be fine. I don't know.

LAURA: Okay! Seeming?

SAM: Yeah, no–

LAURA: Please?

SAM: (smarmily) It's pretty high-level stuff–

LAURA: Scanlan, what if I heal you?

SAM: What if I– ooh! I cast Minor Illusion and give her a moustache. What about that? Is that pretty good?

MATT: A fancy, fancy moustache that you cannot wipe off your face!

TRAVIS: Hey, that's very handsome.

LIAM: I don't think that's going to be enough. It's not quite enough for our purposes.

SAM: All right, I dispel it.

LAURA: How about a limerick as payment, Scanlan?

SAM: A limerick for you?

LAURA: For you.

SAM: Oh! You're going to give me a limerick?

LAURA: I'll give you a limerick. Hold on. I've been preparing it–

LIAM: She's multiclassing a third time.

LAURA: Have you heard tale of Scanlan the Bard? / Or Burt Reynolds, if you look at his card. Always tries to get laid / Sometimes with ladies he made! / But I still respect him, 'cause rhyming is hard.

(laughter, cheering)

SAM: That was excellent.

LIAM: Second firestorm of the night.

TRAVIS: Where's the extinguisher?

MATT: I will give you a d6 inspiration dice for that.

LAURA: Yay!

SAM: Wait– me or her?

MATT: Her.

SAM: Wow. That's impressive. Here's the hat. You can use it–

LAURA: Oh, thanks, Scanlan.

SAM: In about 20 minutes you'll be able to use it.

LAURA: I take off my circlet, I guess, and I put on the hat.

LIAM: How 'bout that smell, everyone? Eh?

MARISHA: Did you live in this?

LIAM: I never lived–

MARISHA: Did you deal with this!? Oh, oh, that's good.

LIAM: I'm, like, a distant cousin to all this.

(laughter)

MATT: In the time it takes for you to take the Hat of Disguise and go ahead and attune to that, you guys are now prepared. What path would you like to take?

SAM: Towards the sounds, yes?

MATT: Well, you have the sound of water rushing to the right, in the darkness, and you have the sound, or, yeah, the view of slight moving light to the left.

LIAM: But did you say, on the right, is it going down, or is it coming down?

MATT: The water is trickling downward; the water continues sloping downward this way. The opposite direction is where the light is. The little bit of light you see in the distance.

TALIESIN: I say we follow the water.

LIAM: Follow the water down or follow the light?

MARISHA: Follow the water towards the light. Right?

TRAVIS: Jesus, what the fuck are we doing here?

LIAM: This is like the Underdark again.

SAM: I abstain.

LAURA: Let's go towards–

MARISHA: Towards the light.

TALIESIN: I'll do whatever they say.

MARISHA: Are we going towards the light or towards the rushing water?

TRAVIS: Light.

MARISHA: All who vote “light,” say “aye.”

TALIESIN, LAURA and TRAVIS: Aye.

MARISHA: All who vote “water,” say “aye.”

TALIESIN: Aye.

MARISHA: To the light.

MATT: So you guys head– left, or–

LIAM: Is there any– I'm sorry, one last question. Is there any Thieves' Cant on the walls at all?

MATT: Make a perception check.

LAURA: Can I look, too?

MATT: You know what, yes, you can.

SAM: With inspiration.

TRAVIS: Is there any poo on the floor?

LIAM: 31.

LAURA: Oh, he doesn't need my help.

MATT: Looking along the walls, you start heading in that direction, you do see a few markings that basically say 'sanctuary' in Thieves' Cant, in the direction of the light.

LIAM: All right. Confirmed.

MATT: You guys continue onward?

LIAM: Yeah, I'll lead the way. Yeah, we sat here for 20 minutes in the stank.

MATT: Yes. (clears throat) So, you guys continue forward up that tunnel. Eventually, as it curves around, the light– you can see– it's shifting, because it appears to be a distant fire light that is the source in this vicinity, and as you turn the corner, as the tunnel slowly curves around, it opens up into a large central sewer chamber, though most of it is dry, and you can see there is a large mound of dirt in the center that seems to rise above most of the water that has collected along the ceiling, and there are a series of platforms constructed out of wooden scaffolding at different levels all throughout this chamber. Some of it looks a little rickety, some of it looks very old, but various states of moisture rot.

(offscreen sneeze)

MATT: You hear a sneeze from the distance from one of the–

(laughter)

MATT: As you look and see a series of small bonfires throughout the room that are currently lit and surrounded by figures. You see a ramshackle tent city, and/or a series of small, wooden hovels that have constructed here. You see a number of figures that are huddled around these bonfires: cloaks, hoods up, generally keeping warm in what is a relatively cold, subterranean area. You guys, glancing over here, as you're first looking, and you can see a few of them appear to be laid up and hurt, and there appear to be at least a few individuals that are heavily bandaged or have slings on. As you guys step into the room, not being very stealthy in your arrival–

LIAM: We could have been, but I use a bit of sign language from the Cant, and let them know that I'm part of the Clasp?

MATT: Okay. A few of them stand up, hands on the side of their hilt, and stop there for a second before one individual steps out of the shadows and puts his hand up, putting it down. You recognize this to be Garthok.

SAM: Garthok!

MATT: He says, “Don't worry, they're with me. I'm glad you made it. It had been a while. I was afraid maybe you wouldn't come.”

SAM: We got held up by some wyverns. I almost died, it was crazy. We're here now.

MATT: “It sounds like it. I'm sorry to hear it.”

SAM: Hey. It's all right.

MATT: “I'm glad you stayed alive.” And as he starts to talk, the group of individuals standing about ten feet behind him separate as another figure pushes past them. Pulling the hood back, you can see a man about six feet in height, average human height, long, blond hair that trails past the middle of his back over a dark grey cloak. Fine features at one time; he looks older, you can see the weathering in his face and the various wrinkles and lines from years and years of living in this atmosphere.

LIAM: You said “human”, right?

MATT: Human, yes. He has a red-tinted monocle over one eye.

SAM: Ooh! I like him already.

MATT: As he steps forward, the rest of the Clasp put their hands off to the side of their weapons. He pushes aside Garthok to the rest of you and says: “So, you are the ones called Vox Machina, am I correct in this assumption?”

SAM: Yes, you are.

MATT: “Hmm! Trusted of Uriel, executors of Modeth the Traitor. One among you is a member as well, "I'm told.”

LIAM: I step forward.

MATT: “Then you are welcome here. I am Spireling Shenn–”

SAM: (whispers) Spireling Shenn?

MARISHA: (murmurs) He's a Spireling!

MATT: “Master of networks and information–”

SAM and MARISHA: Ooh!

MATT: “–of the Clasp of Emon. Excuse the mess, we lost a portion of our territory and are currently caught in mid-adaptation. So, what can I do for you?”

LIAM: Well, you know who we are.

MATT: “And you know who I am, now.”

LIAM: Yes. And you know my spotty track record with the Clasp. But that's all past now. The city's in ruins. You're looking at the right hand of Uriel.

MATT: “Uriel is no longer with us. You are a hand to nothing.”

LIAM: Of course. We're looking for what to do next with this city. I don't think any of us wish to be the pets of the beast that's now roosting in the heart of Emon.

MATT: (chuckles) “No, that does not do any of us any good. Business has ground to a halt, and we've lost a few good patrons in this unfortunate circumstance. We lost our entire northern tunnel structure as soon as the creature attacked the Cloudtop District.”

LIAM: Well, I'll be honest, our first thought was to flee this city.

MATT: “Safer.”

LIAM: But before we make that decision– yes, it is– we know that you're the next best thing to a government in Emon.

MATT: “Hmm.”

LIAM: And we want to know what's left behind.

MATT: “Well, we're seeing to our own. We're going to see how many of our allies still lie within the city. Going to reach out to our friends across Tal'Dorei and see how much of a network we still stand to keep. Then we call in a few debts, reach out to some friends and, ah, we see if we can find some way to supplant this red thing.”

LIAM: Can I insight check?

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: Not good. No. Nine.

SAM: Nine, you said?

LIAM: Nine. The plan now is to lay low and hide?

MATT: “Well, for now, I have a number of operatives topside who are currently trying to get as much information on the red one as possible. The piles of wealth are growing, and it looks like the beast is building a damn home out of the district.”

TALIESIN: The city's going to need a black market.

MATT: “Oh, I am aware, and we are preparing for that. However, it's still fairly fresh, and individuals aren't willing to release any coin when all of it goes to the pouches of the thing that sits on us. Word has gotten back that Westruun was also hit rather hard in the night. And these creatures have continued eastward ever since– no further word on their whereabouts. So we're put in a reactionary position, which I loathe. We're used to being ahead of the rest of the curve.”

TALIESIN: Well, here's where we could help each other.

MATT: “It would appear that could be a possibility.”

TALIESIN: We need this city to stay alive. We need the citizenry to be fed, and we need people to know where they're going to get their medicine and when they're going to get their food. We understand it's going to be tricky. We need information, we need spies, we need to know what's happening in the city, and you need people like us to stay out of your way.

MATT: “That seems like a fairly top-heavy trade in our direction, if you ask me. There are many ways to get people out of our way.”

TALIESIN: There are ways that we can benefit each other.

MATT: “I would love to hear it.”

SAM: (whispers) I would, too.

TALIESIN: We have safe haven– and please, by the way, stop me if you feel I'm being too broad.

SAM: No, go for it.

TALIESIN: We have our keep that is untouched by the dragon's attack– we have a safe haven.

MATT: “Hmm. How is this keep accessed?”

LIAM: We can get to that.

TALIESIN: There are– options.

LIAM: We also have strong connections to Whitestone.

LAURA: And Vasselheim.

SAM: And to The Slayer's Take– that's what they're called, right? Yes? There could be a formidable force that could come to protect the city or drive out the dragons.

LIAM: We're proposing a short-term solution– you want to get back to a position where you can grease the wheels and make money. That's not going to happen anytime soon. But you can't take care of these beasts on your own. And neither can Whitestone, neither can we.

TALIESIN: But it is very likely that we will be the thing that is dropped upon it from a great height, and the most cooperation we can get, getting into a position of power over this beast, the happier we'll all be.

MATT: “Hmm. Let's say we do this, let's say we go forward with this alliance. You get out of our way, you promise resources from Whitestone, perhaps? They have quite a few unique contributions they could make. The Slayer's Take– I have not had many dealings across the Ozmit Sea, but are you referring to, ah, Vasselheim?”

SAM: Indeed. They are a mighty force.

MATT: “Now, that is a tough nut to crack, that city. If you're connected in Vasselheim, perhaps we can talk.”

LAURA: There's no guarantees you'll be able to get in anywhere.

MATT: “There's no guarantees we'll be able to provide food or medicine– it's dangerous times, my dear.”

LAURA: It is. But the sooner these dragons are defeated, the sooner business can get back to usual.

MATT: “Of course.”

LAURA: Ow. I mean– (fake coughs) eh.

SAM: I know I'm getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but once the dragons are gone and the city's returned to normalcy, what is your ultimate goal? To hold power or to remain in the underbelly?

MATT: “All the real power lies in the underbelly, my friend. I have a proposition for you, then. We will do this. We have many channels and secret tunnels throughout the city, and we could very easily deliver food, medicine, shelter, even, to the wired and poor and downtrodden folk of this town, be the subterranean heroes of Emon. Out of the goodness of our hearts, of course. However, once this creature is toppled, and the city is brought toward, I gather you would have the ear of whoever comes to power in this city.”

SAM: We may very well be the person that comes to power in this city.

MATT: “That is helpful. And I imagine you also have some presumably powerful connections in Vasselheim. We would be interested in beginning a sect of our fair trade in that distant, all-too– how do I put it? Xenophobic cityscape?”

TRAVIS: What?

MATT: “If you agree to be our seed in that stubborn garden of a town, you have our aid.”

MARISHA: Can you give us a moment? (softly) Please?

MATT: “My patience grows thin.”

MARISHA: (whispering) Can we talk about this for a second, guys?

MATT: He adjusts the monocle on his eye.

MARISHA: Do we really need them? Are they really providing us with enough to make this worth our while, to where we essentially want to open up the Pandora's Box of crime in Vasselheim? Do we want to be responsible for that?

TRAVIS: Well, I'm all about Pandora and her box, but I don't think we really need this. It's not worth all of that. Especially if we're going to Vasselheim.

MARISHA: I feel like we just took one pretty top-heavy deal and traded it for an even more top-heavy deal not in our favor.

TALIESIN: Oh no, I'm not– I feel the urge to further discuss this. Also, to be fair, we're not representatives of the Clasp; we couldn't, technically speaking, open– All we can do is– I think, the most fair thing to do– to offer in exchange for this is perhaps some trade with the materials that are available in Whitestone and maybe a promise of keeping a blind eye towards their business until the finished reconstruction of the city. Let them reestablish themselves until the city is properly completed.

LAURA: Don't say that.

TALIESIN: You need an underbelly. Underbellies are function. Underbellies function for this very need: the fact that we can actually get food and medical supplies into the city right now if we need to. Less than 72 hours after such a devastating attack, there's no other system–

LIAM: If the Clasp were to vanish, something else would take its place.

TALIESIN: They're inevitable.

LAURA: But I don't want to introduce them to Vasselheim, no.

TALIESIN: At the cost of people starving or not starving.

LAURA: We're already here, Keyleth.

MARISHA: I'm down for joining them and letting them join our cause, and using their infrastructure, but beyond that–

LIAM: Can I use perception to make sure that we're really private right now?

MATT: Make a perception check.

LAURA: Can I join in?

LIAM: 22– Oh, 22, plus can I use my inspiration on this?

MATT: When'd you get that inspiration die?

LIAM: I got it in the wyvern fight.

MATT: It would've faded by now, unfortunately.

LIAM: Okay, so 22.

LAURA: 33.

MATT: 33? You're far away from the crowd. However, Spireling Shenn has been very concentrated in shifting his attention from each person that is currently speaking in this conversation.

MARISHA: He's reading our lips.

LAURA: I turn my back to him and I say, he can read our lips as well as I can.

TALIESIN: Of course he can, which is why I'm not saying anything that I wouldn't want him to hear anyway. I just don't want to promise anything we can't deliver. I don't think we could deliver Vasselheim; we're going to be busy! We have too much on our plate as it is.

LAURA: I don't think they'd listen to us anyway, honestly.

TALIESIN: I'm going to offer what we can give, and see if that's enough.

SAM: We have to have something to sweeten the pot.

MARISHA: Yes.

SAM: What are you offering, money?

LAURA: Offering to sweeten the pot– we're defeating a fucking dragon! Let them get back to normal.

SAM: We can't promise that! The dragon could very easily kill us!

LAURA: We could say– They certainly can't do it without us. And we can't do it without them. But we'll be bringing in other armies with us.

MARISHA: I agree– it's joined forces at this point, that's all we can offer them. A place to fight at our side.

TRAVIS: You're still assuming he's going to keep his word, too.

TALIESIN: Let me go back to him. (deep sigh) Shenn.

MATT: “Yes, hmm.”

TALIESIN: I propose a counter-offer. I just don't feel comfortable offering Vasselheim; I don't think that we could necessarily deliver, and we, honestly, have a lot to do.

MATT: “All I'm asking is an introduction to a handful of key figures in the city, no more than that.”

TALIESIN: Well, I will not promise that now. What I can promise right now is some access to materials from Whitestone, which– and I show him my gun hilt, which is embedded with the gems. I can see what's still lying around, and we can make a deal. I can also promise that for the reconstruction, once this has been dealt with, which is in everybody's best interest, until such time as there's a functioning government in this city, you will be treated with the respect appropriate of a group of people who are helping keeping the city functional.

MATT: “You act like that hasn't been our treatment for the entirety of this city's existence. You think your council didn't have dealings with the Clasp for many years before this happened?”

TALIESIN: Of course they have.

MATT: “We helped make this city function. All we're offering is this service to other places that maybe don't have the right guidance to achieve their true greatness. All I ask is an introduction. Beyond these other. Far after the fact; don't even need to worry about it now. Who's to say what changes from now to then?”

LAURA: Who would we even introduce you to?

MARISHA: We don't even know anyone.

SAM: Yes, we do. We know some high-ranking clerics. We know the Slayer's Take. We met a bunch of people up there.

MARISHA: In a zealot city? You want to go to a cleric and be like, “Hey. Thought you might want to meet the underground mob boss.”

MATT: “We don't have to worry about that now. Just a simple handshake, and it's all done.”

TALIESIN: I'll put something forward to the group. If they prove themselves honorable, if they prove themselves faithful and capable of keeping this city afloat, then we will speak to whomever they wish us to speak to precisely of what they did. No more, no less.

MATT: “If this is an issue of morality, I would like to remind you that, one, we've let you escape after murdering one of our leaders, only upon learning that he himself was an immoral individual.”

LIAM: You're welcome.

MATT: “Also, we went against our word as an organization by letting you take a war criminal that had already paid his way out of the city.”

TALIESIN: And for that, we are grateful.

LAURA: And we gave you something very powerful in exchange.

MARISHA: And you got to keep that man's money.

TALIESIN: That was business.

MATT: “It was business, but business that was persuaded by the actions of good people, and bringing justice. We want society to thrive.”

TALIESIN: I'm willing to kick this ball down the field.

TRAVIS: What?

MATT: “So. Not wasting any more time, shall we make this a fine, healthy city once again?”

TALIESIN: This feels a fair deal to me, and it means that we can leave knowing that the city will, in fact, still have a populace while we're gone.

MARISHA: You seem used to selling your soul, Percy.

TALIESIN: It is the job of ruling.

SAM: If we come back and learn that you have made a deal with the dragons, you'll be the first to die, not them.

MATT: “Oh. I would only hope that would be the case. I wouldn't be caught dead dealing with such a selfish entity.”

SAM: All right, then let's do this. Keyleth, shake the man's hand.

TALIESIN: You don't have to.

SAM: You've got nice soft hands.

TALIESIN: Vax?

TRAVIS: It should be Vax.

TALIESIN: This is not the worst deal I've ever heard.

MARISHA: You just don't know that yet.

MATT: “I have things to do.”

TALIESIN: I have met the devil. That's not him.

LAURA: Don't do it.

MARISHA: Percy, you make me so nervous.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

MATT: “I haven't all day. My arm grows weary with impatience.”

MARISHA: Vax?

SAM: Would you like me to sing to give you some extra strength for that arm?

TALIESIN: Vax, I will make the deal if you're not up to it, but I want your blessing.

LIAM: You know what? Keep your deal.

TRAVIS: Yeah! Attaboy.

SAM: We're going to leave the city abandoned?

TRAVIS: Yes.

SAM: With no one to protect it?

MARISHA: We are not abandoning it. We already discussed it. There's more than one way to cut through this knot.

LIAM: I don't think you're going to let this city fall, anyway. If this city dies, you've nothing.

MARISHA: I agree.

LIAM: If the parasite hasn't a host to feed on, the parasite dies. No, thank you.

MARISHA: Percy? I'm sorry, but I think our methods of being rulers might differ. I don't think I need to sell myself for the greater good.

MATT: “Very well. Unfortunate as it is. Step forward.”

LIAM: Is this a whisper?

MATT: No, this is him asking you to step forward. He steps really close to you, and he takes you by the shoulders and turns you around to face away from him. Do you resist?

LIAM: I'm going to roll out of his hands forward to my friends.

MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics check.

LIAM: 28.

MATT: 28. You tumble away from his grasp, and he (grunts). “Very well. I know your face now, at least. And the rest of the Clasp will know you are a false member, now. You are not welcome in these tunnels ever again, and if we see your face amongst our kind, it will be our word that you are to be taken on sight. It's a shame you've marked yourselves our enemy this day. I wish it wasn't this way. But to step up and confront us with such disrespect for all the patience we've shown you in previous years is just– it irks me. Stinks of a lack of civilization. So please be on your way. We'll do as we do. You do as you. Now be gone.” And he turns around, flicks his cloak, and steps back into the group. The rest of them keep their hands on their belts and wait for you to leave.

SAM: I look at Garthok and say, “Even you?”

MATT: Garthok actually gives you a very stern look and pulls his blade an inch from the side of his scabbard.

TRAVIS: I wouldn't do that.

MATT: At which point, you can see 25 more Clasp members step out. Even wounded ones as they are, all stepping up and gathering. There are now 35 to 40 of them starting to form out of the shadows, forming a semicircle around you entirely.

SAM: Don't do it, Grog.

TALIESIN: Absolutely not.

MARISHA: Let's go. Come on.

TRAVIS: A fellow can't smile every once in a while?

LAURA: We'll just back up.

TALIESIN: I take a bow, and I turn my back to them and walk out.

LAURA: I do not turn my back. I walk backwards the entire way out, with an arrow notched.

TRAVIS: I stay next to Vax.

SAM: I say, party on, Garthok. And then we leave.

LAURA: Keyleth? Darling? Could you maybe make a wall of stone and close off this tunnel?

MARISHA: Unfortunately, no.

LIAM: Save a thought for the people of Emon, if you've any room left in your narrow minds. And I back out.

MARISHA: I end with, hopefully, you will realize there is a far greater enemy at hand than the personal squabbles between us small people. And I also step away.

MATT: The Spireling's not even in view at this point. He's disappeared amongst the rest of them.

MARISHA: I'm sure he can hear me.

MATT: Possibly. As you guys exit and find your way back up to the surface, as the last of you makes it outside of the entranceway, you immediately start hearing this slamming and breaking of stone from underneath you, and you gather pretty rapidly that this entrance is being entirely removed for possible entry.

TALIESIN: I would like to point out, since you had such noble intentions towards my position on things, this is your ego at work here. I may be many things, and I may be a deal-maker, but I never forget that when I rule, I rule these people, as well. I'm not better than them. And you may think you're better than them, but this is what it creates. It creates enemies.

MARISHA: No, Percy. The difference is, I don't think I'm better than them.

TALIESIN: They certainly think you do, and they are not pleased.

LAURA: This mark. Is it magic? Can they trace you through this mark?

LIAM: I don't answer. I walk over to Keyleth. Can you still do the thing with your hands?

MARISHA: (fire noise) That thing?

LIAM: I rip my shirt down. I want you to burn it away. Now.

MARISHA: Vex, do you have an arrow?

LAURA: Of course.

MARISHA: I hand it to him. Put this in between your teeth. (sizzling noise)

MATT: (sizzling noise) Searing white pain through the back of your eyes, Vax, as Keyleth presses her palm into the center of your shoulder blades. You can hear the sizzling and cracking of skin, and smell the burning of Vax's flesh in the air in this cellar. Make a constitution check.

LIAM: Seven.

MATT: Seven. You break through the arrow with your grip, and actually give out a very loud, painful scream out of reaction.

LIAM: Like you do.

LAURA: Similar to when you hit me in my arm.

MATT: Kind of. A moment passes. Keyleth, you pull your hand back, and where the Clasp symbol once was, there is a hand mark burned into the back of the shoulders.

TRAVIS: Vecna.

(laughter)

LIAM: It was you.

TRAVIS: Kill her now!

MATT: What would you guys like to do?

SAM: Well, that was a bust.

TALIESIN: That could have gone so much better.

TRAVIS: Vax, I think you made the right call, and I don't think very often.

SAM: Or very well.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LIAM: Thank you, Grog.

TALIESIN: I think we could have gotten out of there with at least the hintings of an alliance, as opposed to just–

LAURA: Straight up–

TALIESIN: Bitter enemies. This was a disaster.

TRAVIS: Sometimes you have to walk away from a bad deal to find a good one.

SAM: That's not a thing.

TALIESIN: That's not a thing. Where did– you didn't read that–

MARISHA: I got what you were saying, Grog.

TRAVIS: When it rains, the sun is shining.

LAURA: That's deep, Grog. I like it.

TRAVIS: Stew on that.

LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on–

LIAM: No!

LAURA: I already did it. Too late! I fucking touched you, fucker.

LIAM: Does that take the scar?

LAURA: It just takes the pain away.

MATT: Cure Wounds? What it does is prevents infection. It does heal you for the hit points you would have lost for that. I'll say it nullifies the damage you would have taken from the burn mark. It does not alleviate you from the scarring. It's not as graphic as it would have been, had it been left to heal on its own, but it does muddle the Clasp symbol somewhat.

LIAM: Okay. Thank you.

SAM: Shall we go back to our keep?

TRAVIS: We could just kill them all now.

LIAM: There's hundreds of them, Grog.

TALIESIN: (splutters) No, we can't.

TRAVIS: I saw, like, 40 or 50.

LIAM: Yeah, there were another 160 in the rafters.

TALIESIN: It would do no good. Who would be bringing food into the city in the first place?

LIAM: They're going to go on doing the same thing they would have done with us or without us.

TALIESIN: They're doing it without us, though.

MARISHA: But Percy, do you honestly think that after all of this was done– do you want to be beholden to those people?

LIAM: And I don't believe they are going to bend the knee to Thordak. I don't believe it.

TALIESIN: They're not going to, no. Of course not.

LIAM: And that was all I, personally, was worried about.

TALIESIN: I wanted people on the inside keeping us informed, and we just lost a very powerful spy network.

LIAM: I think the only people on the inside right now have scales.

TALIESIN: Everybody needs something.

LAURA: Can we go back to the keep?

TALIESIN: We are not going to bother. We're going to go and we're going to find a way of killing these things, and we're going to hope for the best in this city. That's what we're going to do.

MATT: As you guys are heading back, I need stealth checks from everybody.

LAURA: Stealth check. Pass Without a Trace.

MARISHA: Fuck! Natural one.

TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

MARISHA: Natural one.

LAURA: Then what's the point of anybody rolling?

LIAM: 27.

SAM: 19.

LAURA: 37.

TRAVIS: 29.

TALIESIN: We have a plus ten? 33.

MATT: All right. You guys push southward through the city, finding your way. At this point, the sun has set. Night has come in, and occasionally you hear the flapping of leathery wings overhead as a number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go tearing through the city. At one point, you hear a similar (raspy cry) sound, and you hear other ones begin rising up off the rooftops, heading in your direction, Keyleth. What do you guys do?

TALIESIN: The minute we see that, I'm going to push her against the wall, and I'm going to Minor Illusion a shadow right over her.

MATT: Okay. Make a new stealth check with disadvantage.

LAURA: Add ten.

MATT: (chuckles) It's a natural one on their end.

MARISHA: Oh, good.

MATT: As long as you didn't roll a natural one.

MARISHA: No, I didn't, I rolled an eight, plus a seven, plus ten.

MATT: So, at that point, they (whoosh), one swoops down and lands on the edge of the roof, and you see it curling down. And takes off again, and they continue on, out of the way. You wait a few moments before silence takes the night once more, and you press on heading southward.

(laughter)

LAURA: Nice.

SAM: Good job, Percy.

MARISHA: Thank you, Percy.

TALIESIN: One day you're going to stop being afraid of me, by the way, and I hope that day comes soon.

SAM: Before we go to the keep, do you want to swing by the place?

TALIESIN: The place?

SAM: The place with the airships.

TALIESIN: There's no “swinging by,” that's a caper. That's an entire thing, that if we're going to do–

SAM: Just to go there and look?

TRAVIS: The showroom is fucked. It's broken.

TALIESIN: This is one of those things that we're going to have to get everybody on board before we even start talking about it, so probably a good night's sleep.

SAM: All right.

LAURA: We need to sleep. We need to get up in the morning–

TALIESIN: And then we'll talk about an airship. I'm really on board with the airship.

SAM: All right.

LAURA: I think we need to go to Vasselheim or Whitestone.

TRAVIS: Vasselheim.

LIAM: We don't need an airship to do that.

LAURA: No, we don't. But we also need to find out what's happening with Allura in Whiterun. Westruun. All those cities.

SAM: All right. Back to the keep then, I guess. When we get there can we check in on Gilmore and the queen?

MATT: Yes. And as you return to the keep, Pike has been taking care of the rest of the individuals, and she's been seeing to Gilmore's side. Gilmore is fast asleep, dealing with the tail end of a fever that has broken, after the healing from the day before. Earlier in the day, I should say. It also appears that Salda and the children have been in and out, keeping an eye as well. Pike, as you enter, looks up to you with a smile, and says, “He'll be all right. He's going to pull through.”

LAURA: That's wonderful.

MATT: “I should probably stay with him for a bit. Make sure he's okay.”

LIAM: Is he unconscious still, or just sleeping?

MATT: He is asleep, currently, yeah. “He's been conscious throughout the day while you were gone, but he's got to rest a bit more. He's still had a rough few days.”

TRAVIS: It's dead on.

TALIESIN: Just needs headphones.

MATT: I just need headphones, and to brush against the mic occasionally. Especially during really really impactful story moments.

LIAM: “What? What?”

MATT: So you guys find yourselves resting for the evening. You take to a night's sleep.

LAURA: You going to sleep, Grog?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Yeah, you got to sleep.

TRAVIS: I got to sleep.

MATT: If you don't sleep you're going to start getting levels of exhaustion for the next day.

TRAVIS: Oh. Okay.

MATT: All right. So you lose the strength bonus. Everyone, you can get half of your hit dice back.

TRAVIS: That's a lot of–

LIAM: As the sun goes down? It's been down and everyone's going to their rooms? I go to Keyleth's door and knock on it.

MATT: Keyleth.

MARISHA: I open the door. Hi.

LIAM: Hi. I don't want to be alone tonight. Do you?

MARISHA: I haven't been wanting to be alone most nights. And I let him in.

MATT: Okay. So, we–

LAURA: Bow-chicka-wow-wow!

MATT: Jump forward to the next morning–

TALIESIN: That wasn't the kind of ship I was hoping to get.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I don't think we can all fit on that ship.

MATT: So, next morning, you all wake up; full hit points, get back half of your max hit dice that you spent. All your spells back.

LAURA: I give Scanlan the Hat of Disguise back.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: You sure you don't need it?

LAURA: Yeah, fuck 'em.

SAM: All right. Keep up those rhymes. Not bad for a first timer.

(laughter)

MATT: All right, so. What's the plan?

SAM: You know, Vex, I don't want to be alone right now.

(laughter)

LAURA: I take his face and I push him down on the ground.

MATT: All right. What's the plan?

MARISHA: I don't know.

LAURA: Do we have a plan?

TALIESIN: I suppose our plan is the Slayer's Take next?

TRAVIS: Yeah, Vasselheim.

SAM: How do we get there? Wait, we have to get rid of all the 'fugees.

LAURA: Yeah. We need to go to Whitestone, then.

TALIESIN: Well, here's the question is do we want to head towards Vasselheim from Whitestone?

LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

TALIESIN: So we'll all go. We'll take the last of the– I can't believe I'm going to say this– the last of the 'fugees.

SAM: Yes. Ooh, la la la.

LAURA: Wait. All of our guards, and our servants, as well. I don't want to leave everyone here.

SAM: We're abandoning the keep?

LAURA: I don't know what else to do. If dragons attack, our five guards aren't going to be able to do anything.

LIAM: One dragon crashed in the roof of the building.

TALIESIN: Accidentally smushed.

LIAM: What are the cook and the maid going to do?

TALIESIN: Make it breakfast.

LIAM: Jarett's pretty badass, but I don't think he can handle that.

TRAVIS: Dragons get hungry.

SAM: When we come back, our keep will be gone.

TALIESIN: And we'll be able to build it back up.

MARISHA: It'll match the rest of the city, Scanlan.

LIAM: Percival's the lord of Whitestone. He's got a castle!

LAURA: We find a new keep.

SAM: But my room is just the way I want it.

TALIESIN: I'm sure that some lucky dragon's going to come and shit in your bed. It'll be fine.

SAM: All right, if we're going to leave the keep, I'll need a moment in my room.

LIAM: You'll find another room bathed in self-loathing.

(laughter)

LIAM: It doesn't need to be here.

TALIESIN: It takes a good month to bathe a room in that much self-loathing.

SAM: You look like you're glowing this morning.

LIAM: That's ridiculous.

SAM: I've never seen you quite so chipper.

TALIESIN: Let's gather what we need, make sure that Gilmore is ready to move, as well. We'll bring everybody through to Whitestone.

SAM: All right.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: I guess we should go tell the guards that they probably will have to leave, if they want.

TALIESIN: And that they can come work in Whitestone.

LAURA: Well, I don't want to force them to, but of course they're welcome to.

LIAM: Why don't you go ask the guards? I'll go talk to the kitchen staff.

LAURA: All right.

TRAVIS: I know who she's going to talk to.

LAURA: He's the captain of the guards, anyway.

MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity, you speak with the rest of the keep's staff, including the guards as well. Jarett for the most part is like, “As long as I'm still getting paid, we're more than happy to go where you need us to be. If it's further away from dragons, I am okay with that.”

SAM: Don't you need your tools?

TALIESIN: I can pack up my kit, and I've also technically got a reasonable workshop back in Whitestone.

MATT: Okay, so you gather your materials, you prepare at the tree in the center of the keep, you say your goodbyes–

SAM: Before we go out there, I go to my room, I take a dump on my bed–

MATT: You've used it at the temple of Sarenrae–

SAM: No, it's not a potion. Just a straight-up poo.

MATT: Just a straight-up poo? Okay. Marking your territory. I respect that.

SAM: I hang a note on the gate of the keep.

TRAVIS: Shitting on your own bed?

SAM: I don't want anyone else to use it. And with a butter knife, I put a note on the gate to the keep that says, “If Kaylie comes, go to Whitestone. P.S. If my painting is delivered, please forward to Scanlan Shorthalt, care of Whitestone.”

MATT: All righty.

TRAVIS: “Mind the poo.”

LAURA: I leave a note for Allura, and tell her we've headed to Whitestone, as well.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: I don't say Whitestone. I say, “the place where we sent you originally,” so she knows where it is.

MATT: Okay. Notes are placed. Spell is prepared?

TALIESIN: I've packed everything that could possibly be used to make anything dangerous.

MATT: Okay. You have your supplies at the ready. You all gather in the center of the temple of Sarenrae. Keyleth?

LAURA: Not yet, Keyleth!

TALIESIN: We'll be back.

MARISHA: What's wrong? Are you ready, Vex?

LAURA: I mean, it's the first time we've had a home in forever, and we're leaving it.

SAM: Can you make it disappear, or something?

LAURA: We can go. It's nothing.

MARISHA: I can put Hallucinatory Terrain over it, that'll last a bit, but not long enough to make it worthwhile.

LAURA: It's just stone.

LIAM: We've done it once before. We can do it again.

TALIESIN: It will be built back better than before. That's what we do.

LAURA: Let's go.

MATT: The portal opens outside of the tree, and all of the refugees start rushing through. You guys give chase, following over to the opposite side, where Whitestone waits. You all emerge from the Sun Tree in the center of the familiar town.

LIAM: Fucking cold!

MATT: It is chilly. Not as snow-dappled as it was when you first arrived. A little has melted, and the clouds are a little bit more open; you can see some of the blue sky above you. It's actually a beautiful day, if a bit chilly. As you emerge, you can see there's a few individuals in the center of the town, including a couple of the original refugees that seem to be waiting for the rest to come through. They greet you as soon as you arrive, and rush up and grab a couple of people that they had met at your keep. Some come forward and say, “Thank you. I'm so glad you made it!” They shake your hands. You've arrived back in Whitestone. So, do you guys want to wait here for the day, and then make your way to Vasselheim?

SAM: Do we need to talk to anybody here?

TALIESIN: Just to set up to make sure that the queen and her children are taken in at the castle.

LIAM: I imagine you'll fill your sister in.

TALIESIN: I will. I'll fill my sister in on how they're to be taken care of. Make sure that Gilmore is taken care of.

SAM: We may want to stock up on potions and stuff before we leave.

LAURA: Yeah, buy as much as we can.

TALIESIN: There's a shop.

MATT: There is, but you guys have cleaned it out.

LAURA: Buy stuff in Vasselheim.

MATT: They have not had an opportunity to restock. Their main providers have been killed.

LIAM: Do you think that with the time that's passed, Cassandra has found any of the belongings of the Briarwoods? They were pretty snazzy.

TALIESIN: We can ask about that.

MATT: You approach Cassandra, who is happy to greet you once you return. "Did you have a question?”

TALIESIN: Vax?

LIAM: We need to kill some dragons, and we are out of everything. You've been here a while. Have you found anything of the Briarwoods? Any store of treasure or potion or anything of use?

MATT: “Well, the personal effects you all retrieved when they were defeated. What remnants of income or gold which they'd kept was put in with the rest of the Whitestone treasury when they took over.”

LIAM: Not so much interested in gold as in means of protection or healing.

MATT: “They weren't really specialized in healing, I'm afraid, and what bits of protection they had, you've already taken. But if gold is what you need, we can probably spare you some.”

LAURA: I mean, I'm not going to say no to the gold.

TALIESIN: Obviously, we'll sieve the coffer a little bit because we're going to need it for the mission.

LAURA: So very generous of you.

TALIESIN: Also, let's re-employ our castle guards as the Emon royal guards in the meantime, and they can serve the queen and her children.

LAURA: I like it.

MATT: “That can be very easily presented. Oh, here we are!” There's a small chest with a lid that she hands it over to you. Actually, puts it out and your hands are already out. “All right. 2,000 gold from our coffers. It's not much, but we have to keep the city running.”

LAURA: Of course.

TALIESIN: And a small amount of the green gem, if that would be possible, that's left over from the mining operation.

MATT: “Of the glass?”

TALIESIN: Of the glass. If possible.

MATT: “Yes, certainly.”

TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm working on something.

MATT: “Very well.” It takes a few minutes for that to be retrieved from down south of the tomb in the mausoleum, but nevertheless, you get four half-dollar-sized pieces of residuum glass.

TALIESIN: Perfect.

MATT: Four shards of residuum glass. “I hope that's of aid to you. Apology for the confusion. We have quite a bit of individuals to find homes for, and get them running.”

TALIESIN: Gilmore will be of great help.

MATT: “Yes, as you've told me.”

TALIESIN: (laughs) I'm sorry to drop this all on you, and I'm thankful.

MATT: “I'm thankful that we even have an opportunity to offer aid to somebody. That's thanks to you, so it's nothing on us.”

TALIESIN: It will not be the end of it, sadly.

MATT: “That's all right. Whatever we can do. Anyway, good luck.”

TALIESIN: I'll be off in the morning.

SAM: How are we getting to Vasselheim?

TALIESIN: We can teleport.

LAURA: Yeah, teleport, right?

SAM: Is that true?

LAURA: Just pop on over, yeah. We sleep for the night, and then we go over to Vasselheim the next day.

LIAM: Let's have dinner.

LAURA: Hang out in Whitestone for the day.

TALIESIN: I'm going to work on that little project.

LIAM: Whitestone and chill.

TALIESIN: The thing I was trying to attach to my gun but wasn't working, I'm going to try to attach it to my boot instead.

MATT: Interesting.

TALIESIN: I can draw you a sketch.

MATT: All right. While the rest of you guys are attempting to rest, I need you to make a tinker tools check.

LIAM: Tinker tools. This goes in here.

TALIESIN: That's better. 22.

MATT: 22. You've affixed it to your boot. We'll see if it works.

TALIESIN: And I've got one working piece? I know each individual build, I have to build the–

SAM: The nubbin.

TALIESIN: The actual device itself has to be built for individual usage; it's not auto. I'm going to try and build one and see how it goes.

MATT: Okay. So total cost for the materials on that will put you at about 300 gold.

LAURA: What?

SAM: 300 gold.

TALIESIN: I'm working on something.

LAURA: Okay.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

LAURA: I mean, it's your city.

LIAM: Are you borrowing 300 of your gold from the money you loaned to Vex?

TALIESIN: Since the day I've met her, I've given her every bloody dime I've made. So, yes. I no longer even think about it anymore.

LAURA: And I love you for it.

TALIESIN: She's practically the royal treasurer. She's just happier that way.

MARISHA: (laughing) “She's just happier that way.”

MATT: All right. You find an evening's rest. The next morning comes uneventfully. You find yourselves refreshed. I'd say at this point, you're all at full hit dice after two nights of rest; you're fine. So, on to Whitestone, Keyleth?

LAURA and TRAVIS: Vasselheim?

MATT: Sorry. You're in Whitestone.

LIAM: We were just here!

MATT: You recall you've seen a number of trees. The largest you've seen in Vasselheim would probably have been on the outskirts of–

LIAM: Where we fought the hydra, maybe.

MARISHA: We camped out in a few trees outside of Vasselheim.

MATT: Do you want to stop outside the city or within the city, is the question.

MARISHA: Whatever's closest.

TRAVIS: No. No magic in the city.

LAURA: No magic in the city, remember?

MATT: No arcane magic. Divine magic is a different thing. There's plenty of divine magic within the city.

LAURA: Oh, is there a teleportation circle? Do we have one in Whitestone?

MARISHA: There wasn't a teleportation circle to Vasselheim.

MATT: There are no sigils to Vasselheim. Part of their defense process is preventing any secret intrusion in that regard.

TALIESIN: We'll teleport to the outside of the city and perhaps sleep at the temple of Sarenrae.

MATT: There's the Abundant Terrace.

LAURA: We always have rooms at Slayer's Take, remember.

TALIESIN: We do always have rooms at Slayer's Take.

MARISHA: What's the Abundant Terrace?

MATT: That's the section that Melora looks over. That is where primarily most of the farming, food–

MARISHA: Yeah, let's go there.

MATT: That's where you know there are a number of orchards and things that are kept in that vicinity. If you wanted to.

MARISHA: That's right outside the city?

MATT: It's within the city. It's one of the five quarters. I won't say quarters. It's one of the five areas.

MARISHA: Sure.

MATT: Quarters.

LAURA: Is Gilmore staying here in Whitestone? Yes?

MATT: Yeah, unless you want to try and bring him with you.

LAURA: No, it makes sense to leave him here, right? Where do you want to stay, Gilmore?

MATT: (laughs) You're approaching Gilmore. He goes, “To be perfectly honest, I'm not quite feeling 100%, and let's just say I'm not a huge fan of the zealot type.”

LAURA: Understandable.

MATT: “Vasselheim doesn't really jangle my dingles.”

LAURA: You've got a whole bookstore devoted to you here.

MATT: “This is true.”

TALIESIN: I would appreciate your help in restarting the economy of Whitestone, to be fair.

MATT: “Well. (sighs) Guess it's not too late to open a new branch of Gilmore's Glorious Goods, since my other, possibly, two no longer exist. (sighs) I was so close to opening. I started from nothing! I can do it again. (coughs) Good luck, you all.”

TALIESIN: You as well.

SAM: So we're going to a tree outside of the city?

TRAVIS: Yep.

MARISHA: Well, it's in the farming district in the city.

MATT: It's in the actual city.

LAURA: All right, cool.

MATT: All right. Using this once again off the Sun Tree, you guys step through. As you emerge out the other side, you are in the thick of a heavy orchard in the Abundant Terrace. There is heavy snowfall that has fallen recently here, and where it was cold in Whitestone, it's cold here in Vasselheim. You can see built-up ice and sleet that has recently been pushed off to the sides of the orchard. Even amongst this very cold weather, all of the plant life in this area is vibrant and springtime green. As you all emerge in the center of this orchard, you can see one of the nearby workers who's tilling the land looks over. “Hey! What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be in the middle of the orchard!”

LAURA: Slayer's Take business. We'll keep moving.

TALIESIN: We were just leaving.

MATT: (groans) “Fucking Slayer's Take. Do whatever the fuck they want.” He drinks out of his canteen. “Fine! Just get out.”

LIAM: Glad that manticore's not in your orchard. That's all I can say.

MATT: “Manticore?”

TALIESIN: That's just cruel.

LAURA: Don't worry. We took care of it.

MATT: (weakly) “Thanks.” He starts looking nervously over his shoulders as he goes back to his work. Eventually, you guys step outside of the Terrace, finding your way to the Quadroads, which is the central network that the four main portions of Vasselheim attach to. This is the Erathis-based center of the town. You have before you, to remind you, at the very northern part of the town is the extremely tall, pointed mountain known as Heaven's Stair. Attached to that mountain on one side is the Silver Talon's Reach. That is the main temple to Bahamut. To the left of it, against the mountain, not actually into it, is the Braving Grounds. This is the area that is geared towards Kord, the deity of war, where you had previously had a conversation with the Dawn Master, the Earthbreaker Groon. There's the Platinum Sanctuary in the Silver Talon's Reach, which is where the Highbearer Vord, the Silver-Touched, the high priest of Bahamut is. You also just left the Abundant Terrace, and there is the Quadroads, which is where the Slayer's Take currently is. And there is the Duskmeadow, which is the Raven Queen's domain. Where do you guys want to go?

LIAM: Remind me, what was the Duskmeadow, again? Was that where we chased the rakshasa?

MATT: That is where the Amaranthine Oubliette resides, which is the prison of the city.

MARISHA: What was the name of the section of the city that has the Slayer's Take?

MATT: That's the Quadroads, the Erathis, deity of civilization.

TRAVIS: So, like, I really want to go talk to the Kung Fu Panda master. I don't think we're going to get a lot of fights in. The guy, I think he was the teacher of Kern. The guy I beat in the crucible.

LIAM: That ripped, chiseled old man?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

SAM: The guy who beat you twice?

LIAM, LAURA, AND TRAVIS: No.

TRAVIS: And nobody beat me twice. He got lucky once, get it straight. I want to go talk to him because maybe we need some more fighters and strong folks and I think he might know where they might be.

SAM: We should talk to the Slayer's Take, as well.

TALIESIN: We should get our rooms.

LAURA: Yeah, let's go post up.

TALIESIN: We have things to put down.

MARISHA: And also only about a day's travel from Pyrah.

SAM: What's that? Pyrah?

LAURA: Her home.

SAM: Oh.

TALIESIN: What's left of it. That will be a trip that will be necessary soon, but not yet.

MATT: You guys hit the Slayer's Take first, or where are you heading?

LAURA and TRAVIS: Slayer's Take.

LAURA: Just to let them know we're here and we need some rooms.

MATT: Okay. You make your way to the outside of the main Slayer's Take guildhall. The dark wood exterior greets you happily. You can see they still have a gathering of various antlers of creatures that are tangled into each other that form this rustic-looking entrance. And there on the front doors, you see emblazoned the Slayer's Take– for lack of a better term, their symbol with the words of their actual guild spread across it, as you saw before. Opening the front door, you can see within the main foyer area, there is the dark iron chandeliers that run across the entire length of the moot hall, if you will. Across the front area, you find the clerk desk. Sitting behind it, a familiar red-haired, tousled, chin-bearded, scarred-up tiny man with his feet up on the desk, falling asleep in his chair.

LAURA: (laughs) Oi!

LIAM: Ta-da!

MATT: “What is this craziness? (laughs) Ah! It's been some time.”

LAURA: It has.

MATT: “So. Hello.”

LAURA: Hi.

MATT: “What's your business? What are you looking for?”

LAURA: Dragons? Have you heard about anything?

MATT: “Other than the fact that you killed one. That is the most recent, but nothing beyond that, really, no.”

LAURA: We're going to need rooms.

LIAM: And we're probably going to need to speak to your lady lord.

LAURA: Your wife.

LIAM: Well, your wife, but I'm talking about the boss, here.

LAURA: That's his wife.

LIAM: Higher still: the sphinx.

LAURA: Oh.

MATT: “Vanessa, she's currently out on a hunt. Should be back in the next day or so.”

LIAM: We've urgent business to discuss with her. For now, we need a place to stay.

MATT: “Well, you're always welcome here. This is your home away from home, so please, take a load off. Pick a room. It's up to you. It's good to see you all so healthy!”

LAURA: Healthy.

SAM: Thank you, Mertin. Right?

MATT: “Yes. So glad to hear.”

LIAM: The only reason I remember that is it sounds like merkin.

LAURA: Is Zahra around?

MATT: “She's actually currently out with Vanessa on a hunt, as we speak.”

LAURA: That's wonderful.

SAM: Perhaps we could see her.

LIAM: Sorry, we're tired. We've been hopping all over.

MATT: “Me, too. I was sleeping when you came in. I don't mind if I get back to that.”

LIAM: Sorry. Any room?

MATT: “If it's somebody else's room, they'll let you know, so please, take your time.”

LAURA: Well, settle in?

TALIESIN: I'm settling in.

MARISHA: Yeah, I guess we all settle in.

MATT: There's a number of empty rooms. Doesn't look like there's a lot of individuals around. As you walk down one of the hallways, though, you do see there is a card table, and the two individuals in there, you see a very scarred, burly, and frustrated dwarf who's throwing down cards on a table. Black, long series of beards, and his hair over his beard. You see Thorbir is sitting there at the card table with another man wearing really beautiful, ornate armor that is well-polished; very short, dirty blond hair, who is apparently owning him at cards, going, (chuckles) “You've terrible luck, friend. I'm sorry to hear this.”

LAURA: (whispering) Aldor.

MATT: It's Aldor.

TALIESIN: Whoa!

MATT: Thorbir's sitting there, and throws his cards on the table. (scoffs, sighs) “They tell me I'm supposed to have the luck of the dwarves.”

(laughter)

MATT: “Oh. I guess it's about time you all showed up. I'm going to get a drink.” And he gets up, away from the table, and walks away from the rest of you, with a half-hearted “hi,” but he's in a huffy mood and walks off. Aldor takes his winnings and scoops the change into a pouch.

LIAM: Aldor, Aldor, Aldor.

SAM: How's Lyra? Have you seen her?

(laughter)

MATT: “Why? Have you seen her?”

SAM: Not in a while, but we thought you guys were engaged to be married. No?

TALIESIN: That's the last we heard.

MATT: He reaches forward and grabs your shirt and pulls you in. “Where did you hear that?”

SAM: Not from a reliable source, I promise you.

TALIESIN: Very sketchy source.

MATT: “Good. You haven't seen her, have you?”

SAM: Not in a long time.

MATT: “Good.”

LIAM: She's still a member of the Slayer's Take, of course, though. Isn't she?

MATT: “I assume. I just run if I see her. She's a bit–”

LAURA: Yeah.

SAM: No! She seems nice to me.

MATT: “Good. You know what, actually, if you want to do me a favor. I mean, she's a nice girl, probably pretty easy if you ask her. Why don't you take her off my hands and go on a date? Take her out for dinner. Distract her.”

SAM: You saw her first. I'm a man of honor.

MATT: “Oh. No. I should go.” He grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff.

TRAVIS: Good to see him.

LAURA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: He's looking well.

SAM: True love.

MARISHA: It's weird being back, you guys.

SAM: Well, I guess we should ask them all if they want to come with us to fight a dragon?

MARISHA: Yeah, do we do that now, or do we do that in the morning?

TRAVIS AND TALIESIN: In the morning.

LIAM: It feels like we were just running screaming from dragons in the sky.

MARISHA: Yeah. We traveled.

SAM: We'll sleep on it. We'll talk to Nessa in the morning.

LIAM: We'll get up in the morning, we'll take some of that gold, we'll put it to good use, we'll wait until Nessa gets back, and then we'll carve out a plan.

SAM: Okay.

LIAM: Percival?

TALIESIN: That sounds just fine.

SAM: Kord's strength to us all.

TRAVIS: Yeah!

LAURA: I wonder if Kashaw is still here.

LIAM: Probably, he works here.

MARISHA: Who?

SAM: Kashaw. That was the one that they went on a–

LAURA: Oh! Right, Keyleth? The guy that kissed you.

MARISHA: (stammers)

TALIESIN: Brooding. Handsome. He was so troubled.

LIAM: He was.

LAURA: He was very handsome.

MARISHA: So we should probably go to sleep, you guys.

LAURA: It's morning, still.

MATT: Yeah, it's maybe 10:00am.

MARISHA: Take a nap?

MATT: It's across the world, so it's technically earlier.

MARISHA: You know, it's jet lag. It's teleport lag. It gets to you.

LAURA: Maybe Nessa and Zahra have seen him. We could find out. We could use another healer, always.

MATT: It would be 10:00, 10:30 in Whitestone. About 6:30, 7:00 in the morning in Vasselheim.

LAURA: Pike, speaking of clerics, do you want to check in with your temple?

MATT: Pike has actually stayed back in Whitestone to help the refugees.

TRAVIS: Yep.

LAURA: Oh. She didn't even come to Vasselheim?

MATT: No, but she did say that she's going to keep an eye, best she can, through Sarenrae. When she can pop in, she'll try and see if she can project her form, going forward.

LIAM: She's led by her conscience.

MATT: She's led by her schedule in New York. (laughs)

TALIESIN: We didn't think to leave her a stone, did we?

MATT: If you'd like to, you could have.

SAM: Would we have done that?

TALIESIN: I would have definitely suggested leaving her with one of the stones.

LAURA: Yeah, we probably should leave the stone with her so she can pop in with us.

MATT: Okay. We'll say that she does that. She keeps a gatestone with her, just in case.

TRAVIS: Trinket stays in Emon, right?

LAURA: Shut up!

TALIESIN: Trinket's going to guard the castle.

LAURA: Trinket is right here, right now! He has been quiet, because he's really well-behaved.

MATT: Trinket's been practicing his stealth. (bear grunts)

LAURA: So stealthy, darling.

MATT: All right, so you've set up your rooms, your stuff about you. You have a full day before seemingly anyone from the Slayer's Take is going to come back. Where do you want to head?

TALIESIN: Individual?

TRAVIS: Individuals? Yeah.

LIAM: Oh, shit, can we buy potions in this city?

TALIESIN: I don't know.

LIAM: Shit! You can't, can you?

LAURA: I'm afraid to start anything. It's 11:00.

MARISHA: I know, it's late.

MATT: All right. Then we will end it there this evening. I just wanted to get an idea of where you guys were going for next week.

LAURA: Oh, okay.

TRAVIS: I plan to go see Earthbreaker Groon.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: I want to wait and talk to Zahra.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: I may want to have a conversation at the temple of the Raven Queen.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Zahra sounds fun.

LAURA: Right? But I do want to buy potions, as well, and stock up.

TALIESIN: Yeah, that, too.

LIAM: Nothing. I'd probably tag along with Percival.

LAURA: What?

TRAVIS: Old punchy man? You don't want to come with?

SAM: Oh. Yeah, I'll come watch you if you're going to have a fight.

TRAVIS: No, I'm going to have a conversation.

LIAM: You're right. I do want to see Old Punchy Man.

TALIESIN: We can do both.

TRAVIS: Some hand-to-hand?

SAM: Watch you lose again.

TRAVIS: I'm not fighting him!

MATT: All right, so Vax and Scanlan are going with Grog to the Trial Forge.

LAURA: I'm going to stock up on a bunch of stuff.

MATT: Okay. We'll do some shopping.

TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the temple of the Raven Queen. I also want to talk to our mapmaker friend.

MATT: So you're going to the Raven's Crest. Got it.

TALIESIN: Yeah.

MATT: All right, cool. We'll pick it up next week at that point, guys. Awesome. Well done, guys!

TRAVIS: We abandoned Greyskull Keep.

MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

LAURA: Yeah, we did, and it's sad.

MARISHA: It's very sad. We abandoned Emon.

MATT: Damn.

LAURA: We can't help it from there. We have to go somewhere else in order to come back to it.

LIAM: Greyskull Keep is going to be an ancient dragon's kitty litter box.

TRAVIS: I'm allergic to cats.

MARISHA: If you love it, you have to–

MARISHA and LAURA: Let it go.

LIAM: Like our first hometown, or our elven town?

LAURA: Don't say that.

TALIESIN: I was going to say, do you know who says, “if you love it, you have to let it go?” The one who got dumped, that's who! Sorry.

MATT: That's horrible.

TALIESIN: Yeah, you are. I'm a terrible person.

MATT: Well, guys. Thank you so much for watching. We'll pick this up next Thursday. Those we'll see tomorrow in Colorado, looking forward to it, and tomorrow, look for my next episode of GM Tips. That'll be fun, and is it Thursday yet?

TALIESIN: See you in Arizona! 

Part I

MATT: So, last we left off, the party Vox Machina, having recently suffered their main city of Emon and one of their initial towns where they began their adventures in Westruun under attack from an entity called the Chroma Conclave, a collection of allied chromatic dragons, extremely powerful, ancient across the board, it seems, is wreaking havoc across all of Tal'Dorei. They managed to save a few allies, make a few current, tenuous relationships with the Clasp, and moved all of the refugees that they had been keeping within Greyskull Keep to Whitestone to keep them safe for the time being, as that town had seemingly been passed over by the dragons that are still heading east across the continent. After that, the party made their way to Vasselheim. Vasselheim, the distant city known as the Cradle of Faith, the oldest living beacon of civilization in the world that is currently known. After making their way there, the party made their way into the Guild of the Slayer's Take, where they had previously signed on after a trial and are members of, to seek more allies throughout the city of Vasselheim in hopes of preparing themselves to retake Emon, possibly Tal'Dorei at some point in the near future. That is where we left off. As you guys have spent some time resting within the actual– we've got whispers going around over here already, and we haven't started.

MARISHA: Do you want to say?

SAM: No.

MARISHA: No thank you, keep going.

MATT: Okay. Two can play at that game. So, as you guys take a little bit of time, getting reacquainted with the Guild Hall of the Slayer's Take, setting your stuff down that you need to prepare for a short period of time staying in the city or longer if need be. You ran briefly into Mertin Cyndrial, the husband of Vanessa, who's the Huntmaster of the entire Guild, and had a brief conversation with Aldor, who was beating Thorbir at cards.

LAURA: What a dick.

LIAM: Love that guy.

MATT: He's a nice fella.

LAURA: Not Thorbir, he's great.

MATT: There you go. Not very good with dice. So, that being the case, what would you guys like to do at this point in time?

LAURA: I don't know, I'm just asking you guys.

MARISHA: So we slept and we woke up?

MATT: You just arrived now, it's mid-dayish at this point. Early morning to mid-day.

LIAM: Yeah, we slept at the Slayer's Take, we talked to Aldor for a minute, right?

MATT: You haven't slept, you've arrived, it's like morning, mid-day now. You've just situated yourselves in the Guild. You had an evening's rest before you came here. But you have used your 7th-level spell to get here.

MARISHA: Yes. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

MATT: So what is the plan?

LIAM: Is there one?

TALIESIN: I'm, at this point, prepared for some decompression of some kind. No one can be expected to move at the speeds we've been moving at for the past week. Perhaps grab an early-morning drink and find out how much news has actually reached this town about what's happening out in the world right now.

LIAM: That's a good idea, Percy.

LAURA: We need to find Lady Kima.

TALIESIN: That's actually an even better idea.

SAM: That's a fantastic idea.

TALIESIN: Perhaps she will go to breakfast.

LAURA: She's at the Temple of Bahamut?

LIAM: Yes.

TALIESIN: That sounds right.

SAM: Percy.

TALIESIN: Yes?

SAM: Can I just remind you, for no other reasons than to be helpful to you in the game and no other reason, that the black powder salesman lives here. Just throwing it out there, you might need some supplies.

TALIESIN: It's interesting, because I sleep at night and these voices from nowhere consistently remind me that there's a black powder merchant in this–

LIAM: What game are you talking about? We don't have time for games, there are dragons that need dealing with.

SAM: You're right. How silly of me.

LIAM: Stick to music, please. We don't need games.

TALIESIN: Kima, I think, is an excellent idea.

SAM: Kima is a great idea.

MATT: Last I heard, Victor was blown apart.

LAURA: We also need– oh.

MATT: You don't know.

LAURA: We also need supplies.

SAM: Oh, yes. Hell yes. I don't have anything.

LAURA: We need lots of potions, health potions.

SAM: Yeah, but they sell those here?

LAURA: They sell health potions here. Yeah.

MATT: You've purchased them in the past.

LAURA: Yeah, they sell them here.

MATT: Remember, that's where Grog had his fantastic bartering skills last time to acquire a few potions.

TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm an investment banker.

LAURA: That's right. Oh, that merchant might be here still. We have so many things to catch up on.

MARISHA: We can also talk to the Slayer's Take as well.

LAURA: We're just waiting for Vanessa and Zahra to get back from their hunt. Am I right?

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: Who? Oh, the wife?

LIAM: Yeah, Merkel's wife.

MARISHA: I didn't meet Zahra.

LAURA: No, you didn't.

TRAVIS: She's got a tail!

LAURA: She's quite wonderful.

SAM: She's very powerful.

LAURA: She's actually related to– well, Percy, you would know.

SAM: She's related to Percy? I don't see the resemblance.

TALIESIN: No, she's related to Lillith. They actually are, they are related, that is true. Our friend from previously.

LAURA: Yes, our friend. From previously.

TALIESIN: With that, let's find Kima, perhaps. That would be the best course of action.

MATT: So you guys are going to head towards the–

LIAM: Do you think Kima wants to go potion-shopping? Maybe we should go get some shit and then see Kima? I think Kima would be a little impatient.

TALIESIN: That may actually be a good point.

LAURA: All right, all right, all right, all right. Let's go really fast. There's dragons in the world, we don't have time to shop.

TRAVIS: Can you slam down an hourglass for shopping?

LIAM: Sister, dear, how much coin do we have at the moment?

LAURA: Well, not a ton.

LIAM: How many Pop-Tarts do we have?

LAURA: We have a lot of Pop-Tarts, but not very many gold pieces.

LIAM: In the party, if anyone's holding coin, because I don't have much at all. I don't need much, but we do need healing potions.

LAURA: I have enough in the party funds to buy some healing potions, so I think–

TALIESIN: Is that including what we got from my sister?

LAURA: Yes, it is.

TALIESIN: Let's buy some potions.

LIAM: You're in charge, let's go.

MATT: All right, as you guys heads towards the front door of the Slayer's Take Guild Hall, you're but feet from it before the door slams open as the cold winter wind comes pouring in.

TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

MATT: There, standing in the doorway, you see the outer frame of a strong female form, dark brownish-black leathers, you can see tousled dark hair, piercing pupil-less eyes, and there stands Huntmaster Vanessa, clutching a bag that's seemingly dampened at its base in her right hand as she steps into the main foyer, looking about all of you gathered in the front area. “Well, isn't this a nice surprise in the middle of the morning? Ah.”

LAURA: Welcome back.

MATT: “A pleasure to see you all. Ah, hold on. The rest of you, inside, where it's warmer.” And as she steps inside, you see two individuals step out of the shadows behind her. One of which is another tiefling female, white hair, red in skin, and another individual, familiar to some of you: human, short brown shoulder-length hair, series of scars across his arm, carrying a shield and spear, as Kashaw and Zahra come in to accompany–

TRAVIS: Get your ass in here!

MARY: Look what the bear brought in. Hello, darling.

SAM: Where do I go?

WILL: I'm going to sneak through.

MARY: Hello. Have you gotten bigger?

TRAVIS: Yeah. I've been lifting lots of horses and mules and stuff.

MARY: Oh, my goodness. Hello, darling.

LAURA: Good to see you.

MARY: It's good to see you, too.

LAURA: How are things?

MARY: I'm all right.

TALIESIN: Once you're in, you're stuck.

WILL: Hello.

TALIESIN: Hello.

SAM: You said your name was Ka-SHAW?

WILL: It's KASH-aw.

LAURA: KASH-aw. Like cash. I like it.

MARISHA: Hi.

WILL: How are you?

MARISHA: What are you doing here?

WILL: This is kind of where I live. What are you doing here?

MARISHA: Just, you know, rolling through. Passing by. Not much.

WILL: Okay, who're–?

MARY: Kash, is that–?

WILL: This is her, Z.

LAURA: This is the guy?

MARISHA: Vex, Vex, Vex! Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex, Vex!

LAURA: What?

MARISHA: I push Vex out of the way.

LAURA: (laughs) You called me over to push me.

MARISHA: Yes.

WILL: You're Vex.

LAURA: I am Vex.

WILL: Oh, thank the gods. Yeah, he said you guys looked very similar and thankfully it's not too much, or I felt bad for you.

MARY: Yes, you do look very similar. Does that mean you're–?

LAURA: He's my twin brother.

MARY: It's so lovely to meet you. I whack him with my tail.

LIAM: Oh, jeez!

LAURA: She does that.

LIAM: You are impressive.

WILL: You are a big– I recognize you. Wait a second. I won 75 gold pieces at the Crucible when I bet on Kern the Hammer.

TRAVIS: You did?! That was money well spent, my friend.

WILL: Thank you for that night, by the way.

TRAVIS: You're very welcome. These are my lackeys, I have a band of– you know, wandering–

MARISHA: Lackeys?

LAURA: He doesn't realize that you bet against him.

LIAM: I would not bring– good to see you again– I wouldn't bring that up.

WILL: It was a wonderful fight, did you see it?

TRAVIS: It was, did you see me power-bomb him at the end?

MARY: Hello Percy.

TALIESIN: Lovely to see you again. It's been a complicated month, we'll get into it.

MARY: How are the weapons holding up?

TALIESIN: Quite– well, hmm. Liquefied, but mostly functioning. Hello, I don't think we've met. Percy Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III. And you are?

WILL: Wh-what? Confused. Can you say that again?

TALIESIN: Just call me Percy.

WILL: Okay. Kashaw Vesh.

SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

WILL: How are you?

SAM: It's nice to meet you. I've heard many a tale of your wit and bravery.

TALIESIN: That Kashaw, oh! Yes, that one! Yes, of course.

LAURA: We've heard so many things about you, Kash.

WILL: Hopefully all good, thank you.

TRAVIS: (laughs, then coughs)

WILL: Is he choking?

TRAVIS: I'm good.

MARISHA: And you must be Zahra!

MARY: I am. And you are Keyleth, is that right?

MARISHA: That's right, yeah, yeah.

MARY: You are beautiful, aren't you?

MARISHA: (stutters)

MARY: Sorry.

SAM: I told her, I told her.

MARY: Yes.

MATT: At which point, Vanessa groans, staring at this display.

SAM: Oh, sorry.

LAURA: Sorry.

MATT: “I hope this has worked out well for all of you, I however, have a bit of business of ours to finish, okay?”

MARY: Yes, we do.

LIAM: Hey, what's in that bag?

TRAVIS: Yeah, what'd you catch?

MATT: She walks up to the table where Mertin's standing, he reaches out to greet her, with arms extended. She throws it into his arms, he catches it, pulls it open. You see within there is a head of what looks like a humanoid head, but the skin is greyish and featureless. The eyes are whitish and milky. What hair is there, in wisps, is white in color. Who here is trained in arcana?

MARY: I think I am.

SAM: I am.

MATT: You know what this is.

MARY: I already know.

MATT: Roll an arcana check.

LAURA: Why don't we ask you, then?

SAM: 21.

MATT: 21. This is the head of a Doppelganger. This is a creature that spends a lot of its time infiltrating society, being able to take the form and shape of other individuals to assume their position, to take their wealth, to do all sorts of sometimes interesting or dastardly things.

WILL: Made him a bitch to find.

MARY: Yeah.

SAM: It's a shapeshifter?

MATT: Yep.

SAM: What can you do with the head?

MATT: “Well, turn it in for the money it's worth. Spread the change and forget about it.”

TALIESIN: How do you know when you have one?

SAM: That's true.

TRAVIS: And what was it posing as?

TALIESIN: And at that point, don't you just already have one at that point?

MATT: “Well, this is for me to worry about. Not for you to care.”

LAURA: Vanessa, I have a question.

MATT: “Yes, please.”

LAURA: Do you ever hunt creatures just because they're evil and they're killing people?

MATT: “Generally, somebody will eventually be paying for such a creature to be hunted, so I do not feel the necessity to do it, without–”

LAURA: What if lots of people are dying and you might be at risk as well?

MATT: “Then I think it should be very easy to convince someone to pay for it.”

LAURA: Okay.

MARISHA: What if the cost is the end of the world?

MATT: “Well, I imagine that would be quite a terrible thing.”

MARISHA: Sure. That's what we're looking at here.

MARY: Really?

LAURA: Okay, so. Vasselheim is unaware of what's going on, but a lot of cities have been destroyed.

WILL: Cities. Multiple, cities? Have been destroyed?

LAURA: Multiple cities. Emon was the first one hit.

WILL: It's gone?

LAURA: Well, it's still there technically, just crumbled.

TALIESIN: And flat.

MARISHA: And under rule by an ancient red dragon.

MARY: So much has changed since Lillith was there.

LAURA: So much.

MARY: How did this happen?

LAURA: He escaped. He'd been trapped in the fire plane, and–

TALIESIN: We're not entirely sure what happened, but he escaped the fire plane and somehow created a coalition of chromatic dragons and they are ravaging the countryside.

LAURA: Yes. Which is very strange.

MARY: What color?

WILL: How many?

LAURA: Red, white, green, black, blue was one of them at a time.

MARISHA: They call themselves the Chroma Conclave.

TRAVIS: Eight total.

MARY: The Chroma Concl– there were eight?

LAURA: There's four of them. There's four of them.

MARISHA: No, you're– you don't double them by city. It's just one city– No, never mind. Just one dragon.

TRAVIS: One, three, five, eight.

MATT: Vanessa's crossed her arms and thinks for a second and she goes, “Ah, if what you say is true, this is very unfortunate. And a bit larger than what our simple guild could even hope to really help. This would be something to take to the various temples.”

LAURA: Yes, and we plan on it, but we know that the Slayer's Take is full of very strong, very qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you at our side as well.

MATT: “Well. Let me put it this way. If what you say is true, multiple incredibly powerful ancient dragons roaming, destroying– this is not something you can throw yourself at until eventually one or the other falls. You have to find a weakness, you have to find the way to be on their level. Ask around. See what other allies you can find.”

LIAM: Yes.

LAURA: A metallic dragon.

TALIESIN: Temple of Bahamut.

LIAM: What you say is correct. These are the first moments after us finding out, this is a first step. But being members here and seeing what your people can do [no audio] I know this is just a first step, and we're about to enter Vasselheim proper, but–

MARISHA: It should speak pretty loudly that we came to you first. That's how much we trust you.

LIAM: Can we count on you?

MATT: (sighs) “I am Huntmaster of the Slayer's Take. I deal in contracts, I deal in business, I deal in the hunting of relatively unorganized creatures. This– this is beyond me. That is not to say I would not be willing to help, but there are many things to consider first. Perhaps you should speak with Osysa.”

SAM: What, who?

MATT: “Osysa.”

SAM: Osysa?

LIAM: The sphinx.

MATT: “Our patron of Ioun.”

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: “She would have a better mind for this than me, this is…”

LAURA: How do we talk to her?

MATT: “The same way you did last time.”

LAURA: Yes.

MATT: “Follow me.”

MARY: Before we go, I believe we have a little settling-up to do?

WILL: I'm cold and I still haven't been paid.

MATT: “My apologies. Mertin!” He's over there, he's currently putting the head into a small case and closing up and he goes, “Aye, not to worry I'll be more than happy to get this for you.” And he leaves for a second, comes back, goes through the contract, reads a couple things. Pulls out a large chest and begins divvying up coin and throws a satchel to each of you that contains, for both of you divided for this contract that would come to 2,250 gold pieces.

MARY: Pleasure, as always.

SAM: They have more than we do.

LAURA: No, they don't.

MARY: Thank you very much.

MATT: “Of course, that's what I'm here for!”

MARY: It was an interesting challenge, thank you. We had a rather good time with that one.

WILL: Interesting trying to track it down, that's for damn sure.

TRAVIS: What was it hiding as, by the way?

MARY: A plethora of different entities and beings, it was running around town changing at will.

LAURA: Isn't that like that rakshasa you were talking about?

MARISHA: It seems familiar, actually.

WILL: Does sound familiar. That was interesting and bloody!

MARISHA: Yup!

MATT: “Regardless… Shall we? Very well.” And she begins walking further to the back of the guild hall, where you come to the same doorway that you previously entered with her before. The chains in the side, that sets up a large slab that leads to a staircase that leads to the subterranean area right beneath the Slayer's Take. You may have noticed it previously, but there is a structure above where the subterranean area is, behind the Slayer's Take. And it's– it looks like a very simple temple. You haven't really gone into it, but as you step down into this dark area underneath you can see the sconces lighting along with you as you step into this dark cavern. As it opens up once again, you can see the remnants of this hidden temple to Ioun, the Goddess of Knowledge. And what's curious about this temple is Ioun is a goddess of knowledge and openness. One of her main astute pushes is the fact that knowledge is to be shared and spread, so it's curious to see that something of hers is hidden. There's probably a purpose to that. Pushing up the steps again, Vanessa puts her hand up and tells you all to stop and calls out again. “Osysa! I apologize to bother you, but we have a predicament that I believe requires your attention.” As a moment passes, where once again you hear the low, rumbling growl in the shadows. (growls) You hear slams of giant footfalls across stone as what little bit of light torches begin to spark to life around the top of this platform, this stone platform. And at the very top of this staircase that leads to the top of where this platform ends, you can see standing above it a very large female sphinx with a lion body, a female head adorned with golden jewels around the neck, eyes that are light sky blue and white in color. Proud as these giant griffin-like wings stretch out and the entity comes to rest at the top, paws folded over the edge. “Yes, I recall. So what do you need of me?”

LAURA: Well.

TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it, Vex.

LAURA: Your help, potentially. The world is under attack.

MATT: The head sinks for a moment. “I have been watching by the heartstone, naught but this past day I have been keeping tabs in hopes that such a cataclysm would not find its way to my mate. It has not. So. Being aware of this, what do you ask?”

LAURA: Is there anything that you know of that could help us defeat these ancient beings?

MATT: She thinks for a second, steps up and closes her eyes. As her muscles tense, her eyes open again, that color flashing with this luminescent blue color. And her voice falls even deeper into her register, and almost has this monotone informative projection that says: “The Vestiges of Divergence, relics wielded when the gods walked and fought alongside their creations.” The light fades from the eyes, for a second she catches herself and steps back.

MARY: May I ask, what are the Vestiges of Divergence?

MATT: She shakes her head. “I am a channel for this knowledge, but the best I can understand, they are old relics of the War of the Divergence. Leading into the penance, the Second Spark. These were armaments. Objects of great power that were used in these wars against the gods, good and dark. Many have been buried, entombed, lost, forgotten. The few that are recovered are passed on through blood lines, through symbols of power and of seats of great political importance. But the actual information is lost to me.”

LAURA: Do you know of any one in particular?

MATT: She concentrates for a second. “Not within my field of vision. Objects of this powerful enchantment are also prone to want to keep themselves hidden.”

LAURA: That's convenient.

MARISHA: Osysa. If you are aware of this knowledge, then you know that Vasselheim is one of the only remaining cities still left standing. Are there any other services you can offer to help us fight this?

MATT: “The danger that you run here is that Vasselheim has stood the test of time and survived two possible ends of civilization as we know it. But it has survived both of these events because those who guard it stayed to guard it. You may be hard-pressed to convince others to step beyond the walls knowing that such a danger could use that to their advantage and destroy the greatest city that we know of. You are welcome to ask, but it will be a difficult journey. What I can offer, though: my mate is a keeper of much hidden knowledge, over on his side of Tal'Dorei. I may be able to send you to him to seek this information.”

LAURA: Much hidden knowledge?

SAM: About these Vestiges, perhaps?

LAURA: Does he serve your same god? Or another?

MATT: “I am one of the chosen of Ioun. He does not serve her directly.”

LIAM: Information is welcome and we are thankful. And we have been impressed by your wisdom, very much so. The people you employ are chosen very carefully and very well and we all have been impressed. In addition to information, you provide a service with the Slayer's Take to Vasselheim. Do you have any interest in spreading that influence to Emon, if we can save it?

MATT: Her large paws cross once again, and she looks at you with a stern expression. “There is great danger and darkness in this world, and there are many fools who stand up in hopes that they can keep it at bay. If we were to lend our power to you, I would ask that you prove yourselves the ones that could carry this torch.”

LIAM: How so?

MATT: “Perhaps find these relics. Gather other allies. Prove to me that I would not be sending my people to their doom. Then return. Perhaps then, when you think you are ready, we could lend our guild to your service.”

LAURA: All right.

MARISHA: And where does your partner reside?

MATT: She closes her eyes and concentrates for a moment. “South of the Frostweald, the mountain range that guards it.” Her eyes open again. “Understand that it is our nature to present challenges. Part of his journey to seek him is to find him yourself. That is the first step.”

MARISHA: Does he have a name?

MATT: “It is his name to give.”

LAURA: One small question, Osysa, I'm sorry.

LIAM: No, no.

LAURA: You serve the goddess of knowledge, of openness.

MATT: And she steps back and you see the crystal sphere, the heartstone that she once helped you look through before to look back at the world, glows beneath framing light under her form. “Yes.”

LAURA: Does that mean you would know anything of the god of secrets: Vecna?

MATT: As you say that name, she snarls. (roars) “It would do you right to not mention that name in this place.”

LAURA: I apologize.

MATT: “Yes, I know of him.”

TALIESIN: His touch has been felt in the north.

LAURA: Very close to here, actually. Would you know of a way to rid ourselves of his weapon, of his tool?

MATT: “If I did, we would have done so long ago. This creature is one of the few entities that shrouds my vision. The limits of our sight, of the things we seek to discover and unveil, are constantly balked by the veil of darkness he throws over the world. He may have been held at bay, many thought destroyed hundreds of years ago, but no, he stays. And he squeezes a stranglehold on everything we seek to accomplish.”

LIAM: Well then, allow us to do you a service. We have had dealings with his underlings. We have knowledge, which we freely give. Freely. If it does anything to help our case, winning your aid. And we will seek your partner and we will find your partner. We're not trying to score points, we are trying to do right. Percival?

MATT: “What do you know?”

TALIESIN: Dark creatures attempted to, as best that we can surmise, open a gate beneath the castle of Whitestone.

MATT: “Whitestone.” She steps back for a second, her eyes flare up with energy again. You can see the heartstone embedded in the floor of the stone glow even brighter and brighter as she puts her paws in the side and peers into it. She begins to mutter beneath her breath. “I can see the snowy north of Tal'Dorei, the castle. Beneath, one of our corrupted temples, forgotten long ago.”

TALIESIN: Your temples?

MATT: “The ziggurats were not of his construction. But he took them.” Her eyes wince for a moment. Her head turns for a minute, her vision and face staring in the distance. “I look out to follow the anger, the swath of death and hatred. Those who took Emon, they draw my gaze. Something is happening.”

LAURA: Right now?

TALIESIN: What do you see?

MATT: “The path to Westruun, eastward.”

LAURA: What's east of Westruun? Who has the map?

MATT: “Parts smoldering and left behind, the path continues over the Lucidian Ocean, eastward beyond the shores of Wildemount.” Her head looks up, still staring off into the distance. “Into the Drimaulth Ravine. I see the floating islands of Draconia falling. Crumbling. Gone. An army sundered. People ruined. The Conclave, sated, returns towards your land once more.” You can see blood pouring out of one of her nostrils now. The light dulls in her eyes and the heartstone fades for a moment. She gathers herself. “I peered too far beyond the veil that contains me, I'm sorry. My (pained grunt)–” She plops down and is breathing a little heavy.

WILL: Can I heal you?

MATT: She takes a few steps down towards you. “Brother Kashaw. It would be appreciated.”

WILL: Puts his hand around the medallion. Closes his eyes. Puts his hand out, touches her.

MATT: “Thank you.” She steps up and bows her head to you. She steps to the top of the temple once again. “I've seen this darkness you speak of under Whitestone, and I shall speak out to our brethren of Ioun in hopes of discovering the nature of this shadow. I'm sorry, I must rest.”

TALIESIN: Of course.

LIAM: We thank you for your time. We are your willing allies.

MATT: “Return when you have proven yourself.”

MARY: We shall.

MATT: “When you think this Conclave could possibly be felled beneath your weapons and might and will.” She whips around the wings (whoosh) as the torches atop the temple flare out and you can see the edge of Osysa's form as she dives into the shadow to the back of the temple. You can hear the impact of giant footfalls against sand and then silence.

LIAM: Zahra.

MARY: Yes?

LIAM: You said, “We shall.” Have we convinced you?

MARY: Knowing that there are four dragons, at least–

LAURA: At least.

MARY: Four to eight dragons, according to Grog, out there. And after our dealings with Rimefang, I cannot let this go. You know I cannot, Kash.

WILL: Z, this is fucking happy fun bunch over here. They bring death with them everywhere they go. This isn't our fight.

MARY: Not all of them.

SAM: I don't kill very much at all.

WILL: Good to know.

TALIESIN: Didn't you kill the king of–?

WILL: Except for kings, all right.

MARISHA: We just had a third-party perspective.

SAM: Yeah, I mean, she gave us a lot to “sphinx” about.

(groaning)

TRAVIS: Wow.

SAM: No? No?

MARY: It's nice to know Burt Reynolds is still around.

MATT: There's a very slow clap echoing into the cavern, as Vanessa goes–

(laughter)

MATT: “And to think, I might have briefly missed you.”

(laughter)

LAURA: We should leave the temple.

SAM: Wait, did Osysa just tell us she could possibly send us to her partner?

LAURA: She told us where he is, and we have to find him.

SAM: Oh, we have to make our way.

WILL: You have to find the no-name guy who's going to help you find the stuff that's hidden that nobody knows where it is.

LAURA: I thought we were finding the stuff that's hidden while we're finding him.

MARY: We will find her mate, he who is not named.

WILL: Well, as long as it's not convoluted.

MARISHA: He is south of the Frostweald, in the mountains.

LAURA: I hate to thay this–

LIAM: Yeth?

MARY: Speak freely.

LAURA: So, these Vestiges are ancient, right? Spread across the land. Wasn't Tiberius looking for a bunch of objects of magic that his people had sent him to find? Perhaps that's the reason Draconia was hit. Maybe they were trying to hide these items.

TALIESIN: It's possible.

SAM: That's a big “what if?”

LIAM: Do you really think the Mending Wheel, though, would help us against Thordak?

MARISHA: I feel like we'll know if it's an ancient Vestige of Divergence.

TALIESIN: This is good. This is a path for us to walk.

MARY: So, Draconia is gone. Is that my understanding?

TALIESIN: Well, most likely, yes.

MARY: What else is left?

LAURA: Vasselheim. Whitestone.

MARISHA: Zahra, Kash?

LAURA: Potentially Syngorn, even though it's hidden.

MARY: Well, we can either stay here or we can–

LIAM: They're opting out of the conversation.

MARISHA: Have either of you been near Pyrah, in the mountains east of here? Have any of you been where the Fire Ashari reside?

MARY: I have not.

WILL: No.

TALIESIN: Going to have to make our way there, eventually.

SAM: A lot to do.

LAURA: It's a lot to do.

SAM: Maybe we should split up into eight groups.

TALIESIN: Actually, 11 groups.

MARY: That would be 12.

LAURA: How many is that, Grog?

TRAVIS: Four.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Do we know how far away the Frostweald is from here?

MATT: The Frostweald is back in–

LAURA: By Westruun.

MATT: South of Westruun.

MARISHA: Like where we started, right? In Stillben.

MATT: That was where you got the heart of the nymph.

MARISHA: That's not far from the Air Ashari, correct?

LIAM: Do you think she's still there, Grog?

TRAVIS: Oh yeah, trust me. When you have Grog– you never leave?

LIAM: Yeah, that's the expression, I'm pretty sure that's the expression.

LAURA: We need to find Kima, we need to go to the Temple of Bahamut.

SAM: Yes, you're right, yes.

LAURA: Talk to people that are capable of helping us.

LIAM: We need Kima. Potions first. I don't want to bore Kima, then Kima. Yes?

LAURA: Hey, does the Slayer's Take have potions we can just have? Don't they have like a supply room?

LIAM: It would be welcome.

MATT: “We have things we can provide, as you are members.”

LAURA: Oh good, yes.

MATT: “Mind you, not extremely active members as of late, but…”

LAURA: But we will be. Think about the giant amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather wings and scales.

LIAM: We're about to get really fucking active.

LAURA: We're going to be so fucking rich.

MARY: Think of the armor I could forge you from red dragon parts.

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

LIAM: Can I give advantage if I go like this the whole time?

MATT: No. That's closer to disadvantage.

(laughter)

LAURA: Oh, how about 12?

MATT: “Yes, I'll provide you with what we can. Come with me.”

MARISHA: Aw, she likes us.

LAURA: No, I could have gotten something really badass if I had rolled better.

MATT: So, you guys step up and you lead back to the Slayer's Take guildhall. She snaps at Mertin, whispers something in his ear, and he comes and offers a small chest to you guys that contains two potions of healing and one potion of greater healing.

LAURA: Oh good, two potions! Vanessa–

LIAM: It's welcome, it's very welcome. Which way is the potion shop from here?

MATT: “Go to the Quadroads.”

SAM: Quadroads, of course.

LIAM: Yeah, we haven't been here–

LAURA: In quite a while–

TALIESIN: As you know.

MATT: “I'm afraid your symbols have been getting dusty.”

LAURA: Grog.

TRAVIS: Hm?

LAURA: You don't have any potions left?

TRAVIS: No, I've got like, three potions.

LAURA: Who doesn't have any potions?

SAM: None.

LIAM: None.

MARISHA: Yeah, I have a couple.

LIAM: Hey, I'm squishy as hell, can I have one?

LAURA: You get the greater one. You get one, and you get one.

TALIESIN: All right.

MARY: May I speak with Vanessa very quickly?

MATT: “Zahra, what can I do for you?”

MARY: Kash, come with.

WILL: Kash walks over with her.

MARY: Vanessa, we've done many jobs together. And I think we've been very loyal to you. We've brought in a lot of money for you. My only request is, is there anything extra? Are there any spare potions, any amulets of protection, anything? You know this is going to come to us.

MATT: “And there is a lot of great money that you've made that could pay for these things.”

LIAM: (whispers) But her voice is so deep!

MATT: “I've given you already more than I needed to. You can afford it. If you were broke and asking me, maybe I'd be happy to ask, but I just paid you quite a sum of money.”

MARY: I know you did.

MATT: “I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.”

WILL: That's not what we mean, you know that, come on. Just give us free stuff.

(laughter)

MARY: I meant no offense whatsoever. I mean you no offense.

MATT: “And none is taken. However, I would say, there is business to be had deeper in the city. You wish potions, there are those that purchase them. I've already given you what I have and what you've earned.”

MARY: And we thank you for that.

MATT: “Very well.”

LAURA: Thank you, Vanessa.

LIAM: Vanessa, hey. I'm not asking anything. We're going to get you into Emon. That's a promise.

MATT: “I look forward to you coming back and proving me wrong.”

LIAM: We're going to double your fucking business.

LAURA: Mm, we're going to bring you so many scales. You just wait.

MATT: (deadpan) “I've never heard this before.”

(laughter)

MATT: “I've never been disappointed by it, either. In all sincerity…”

SAM: “… leave.”

(laughter)

MATT: “The gnome speaks because I do not have to. But good luck, and don't stray too far. Stay safe, please? I put a lot of faith in you.”

SAM: All right, to the potion shop. To the Quadroads.

LAURA: Wait, oh, wait! One thing. I know we're going.

LIAM: Mirrors.

MARY: (laughs) No! (clears her throat)

SAM: I attempt to read lips.

LAURA: Is Lyra around? Anywhere?

MATT: As you say that, you hear a voice in the back of the room go, “What, is she?!” You see Aldor in the back table, he's already up with his bag, ready to run.

(laughter)

MATT: “Aldor, sit down, it's okay. Ah, not at the moment, she's currently helping her uncle.”

LAURA: At the place where he is.

LIAM: In town?

SAM: The place where we got a lot of stuff.

MARY: We got the horses last time.

MATT: “He's the ambassador.”

LAURA: Cool. Thank you.

WILL: As they're leaving, can Kash pull Zahra aside really quickly? Are you going with them? Seriously?

MARY: What do you want to do, do you want to stay here while the world burns?

WILL: Yes.

MARY: Why?

WILL: Because we're here. It's warm, we make money.

MARY: Not if nothing's left to protect. Not if there are no monsters left. If these things get out, if they spread their fire across the globe, what's left for us?

WILL: If, if, if. If any of the monsters we miss went out and spread– the world's always ending, baby!

MARY: They just took out Draconia, darling. All of it. Gone.

WILL: I'll follow you. Anywhere. You know that.

MARY: I know. And I'll follow you.

WILL: Tell me what you want to do and I'm there.

MARY: For a while.

WILL: Let's go.

MARY: If we don't like it, we'll leave. If we find something better.

WILL: We'll leave. Okay. Leave half the gold here. They don't need to know everything that we have.

MARY: Fuck that.

WILL: All right.

MARY: We might need it.

WILL: Then hide half the gold. I don't trust the twins as far as I can throw them.

LAURA: I can read your fucking lips.

WILL: Apparently she reads lips.

(laughter)

MARY: Oh yes, I'd forgotten that. All right. She knows how much we have. We're going for a while.

WILL: Was I wrong, by the way? Did you see how hot Keyleth is?

MARY: She's fucking hot.

WILL: That's what I'm saying. Let's go, we should go.

LIAM: We're so nice!

LAURA: We're so nice!

LIAM: What the fuck is that about?!

MATT: All right, so you guys head out of the Slayer's Take guildhall into Vasselheim, which is now a little more bustling than it was when you arrived. It's about midday. The sun is still not visible. There's enough cloud cover where you can see where it would be in the sky, but it's still pretty grey. No rain, and there is still relatively recent snow that covers most of the city streets, some of which has been pushed to the sides to make walkways easier. It's been snowing here in the winter rather often, as you two are both very aware. You have multiple things you want: the potion shop, there's the Platinum Sanctuary, I think last time you mentioned the Trial Forge.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: What do you guys want to do?

LAURA: Potions first.

MATT: All right. So you make your way to the Quadroads.

LAURA: Can I pull him aside as we're walking there?

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: And ask, so, I thought you were interested in Keyleth. Am I wrong? I mean, you're interested in Keyleth. Right? I mean, I know you don't want to tell me. I know you don't tell me anything like this, but– is it weird that he's here?

LIAM: No, he's fine. And I am.

LAURA: Okay. Should I take him out?

LIAM: No!

LAURA: Because I can.

LIAM: No, he's–

LAURA: Destroy him.

LIAM: He's useful. And I don't hold anything against him, and she's– why wouldn't he want her? Of course he does.

LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, Keyleth is so! Fucking! Beautiful! I get it.

LIAM: Well, so are you, but what the fuck am I going to do with that? Jeez, you're fucking weird. And I walk off.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Now we're getting somewhere.

MATT: Coming back to the center of the Quadroads, you guys have been here before. This is where the center of the city's trade happens. Imagine the central Abdar's Promenade of Emon, as it once was, but condensed. And it is just hovels and tents and all these open shops that are crammed in this heavy space. It looks like the– what's it, from “Hellboy II”–

WILL: Underground mall. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

MATT: Wall to wall buildings, but people, not weird creatures. People shouting, people are– get some proper audio for this, one second.

LAURA: Fresh fish!

MARY: Fresh fish!

MATT: Exactly. So as you guys are walking around, you eventually find your way up to the same area where you found the potions from before. You can see him there, he's wearing an open red vest that falls to the ground behind him, arms are revealed, he has these thick bracers on that are really finely scrolled with brass. He's got a fine Van Dyke beard going on now. He's currently speaking with someone off to the side. “Yes, of course, I'm more than happy to, yes. You! I remember you. Oh, it's been quite some time–”

LAURA: You!

MATT: “Step on over here, sir, I would love having more–”

LAURA: I push Grog out of the way.

TRAVIS: What, hey! What?

LAURA: You.

MATT: “Yes, can I help you?”

LAURA: You sneaky mother– Is he the one?

TRAVIS: What?

LAURA: Is he the one haggled with you? The one you traded all of our–?

TRAVIS: I got a really great deal!

MATT: “He got a fantastic deal the last time. He's a grade A customer. I'm sorry, is there a problem?”

TRAVIS: Nope, no problem at all, you'll be doing business with me.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Sit back, love, and watch a pro work.

MARY: Have we all walked into the store?

LAURA: He's a cart– he's a stupid cart salesman.

TALIESIN: We're all going to learn something very valuable right now.

TRAVIS: I don't know if you've noticed, but these twats below me need healing potions. Mm, whatever. Do you have anything like that on you?

MATT: “Hoo, hoo, hoo, do I? Do not worry, sir. Hold on just a moment.” He disappears into the small tent opening behind him.

LAURA: Keyleth, Hold Person or something to shut him up!

LIAM: Yeah, I mean, it's funny, but we don't have that much gold.

LAURA: We don't have anything.

TRAVIS: (calls out) I've got 6,500 gold to spend and I mean to spend quite a bit of it.

MATT: “Music to my ears!” You hear from inside the tent, as he comes out with this long, very well-carved wooden– looks like a test tube set, almost. There are all various potions of different sizes and colors. He sets it down. “So, potions of healing, you say.” He pulls out a few of them. “This here I have, two superior healing potions…”

SAM: Ooh, nice.

MATT: “Three greater healing potions and ten regular potions of healing, at your disposal, should you require them. Mm, yes.”

LIAM: Grog, what about this? You are really strong and really good at killing things and my left– left? Yeah. Nut still has a dent in it. You are really fucking strong.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LIAM: You are the best there is at what you do.

MATT: “And by far a handsome and intelligent salesman.”

LIAM: Please shut up. My sister is very good at– do you know what math is?

TRAVIS: Mathis?

(laughter)

LIAM: Vex'ahlia is very good at–

LAURA: I don't even want to deal with this dick now!

LIAM: She is an excellent shopper. I'm telling you, you know how you take things' skulls and turn them into like raspberry jam?

TRAVIS: Yeah, like a paste.

LIAM: Yeah, that's what she does with money. And I'm saying, we've had our differences, and I know you're stronger than me and I'm saying as strong as you are, that's as good as she is with shiny.

MATT: “And yet she was so abrasive when she arrived.”

LIAM: I say, shut up!

MATT: “Fine, hmph!”

LAURA: Darling. You're lucky I don't– Trinket? Have you seen my pet bear?

MATT: Trinket stumbles inside.

LAURA: Quite adorable. He loves potion salesmen.

TRAVIS: You know, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I'm actually the current reigning champion of the Crucible. And with that title comes many things, like people that manage your shinies. I would like to introduce you to my shiny manager, Vex.

MATT: “This one, really?”

WILL: Why was he holding your nut?

LAURA: (laughs) No pressure now–

LIAM: It was a little bit of pressure.

TRAVIS: I didn't really hold it, it was like a flick.

MARY: A flick?

LAURA: Look, I'm willing to trade you some very powerful magical items for some schmeasley little potions that heal people.

MATT: “How many would you like? What do you want?”

LAURA: I want them all. How much?

MATT: “All of them?”

LIAM: Bulk.

MATT: (chuckles) “Well, then. Let me do my math here.” He looks through it. “All right, um…”

WILL: By the way, as you're adding that up, I'd like to say you should tread lightly or I'm going to tell Vanessa and you'll have trouble getting anything from the Take ever again.

MATT: “The Take? Are you with the Take?”

LAURA: Oh! Do you not see these– These amazing–

MARISHA: That's right, we get union discounts.

MATT: “Yes, there is indeed a discount with the Take (nervous laugh). They've been great representatives in the past, yes.”

LAURA: I like you more and more, Kashaw, every time you speak.

WILL: Most people do. Ask Keyleth.

MARISHA: (nervous laughter) What?

MATT: “With friendship discount, let me total this up a bit here.”

MARY: I walk outside, and I–

MATT: “That will be 6,500 gold pieces for the lot.”

LAURA: I'm sorry, how much?

MATT: “6,500 gold pieces for the lot, with the discount.”

LAURA: Right.

SAM: So coincidental. That's exactly what Grog offered.

TRAVIS: That's what I have!

LAURA: How about, instead of that, I trade you–

TRAVIS: (loud whisper) 7,000!

LAURA: Thank you, Grog.

LIAM: (whispers) Stick to the killing!

LAURA: These magical items. And I pull out the knickknacks that I took from I don't fucking know where. It's knickknacks. But they're magic.

TALIESIN: Is knickknack a candy bar?

SAM: Vex, no. You can't, you can't possibly trade that. It's too valuable. What are you doing?

LAURA: Well, I know, but where else are we going to find a vendor–?

SAM: Those are the Knickknacks of Kaa.

LAURA: I know, and they're quite valuable. But he said six thousand, six hundred and (mumbles) and we know this will cover that.

SAM: I can't. Please sir, please don't take advantage of us by taking these things from us. They're too valuable, please, I beg of you.

TALIESIN: What have you pulled out?

SAM: The Knickknacks of Kaa.

TALIESIN: The Knickknacks of Kaa?! No, not the Knickknacks of Kaa!

LAURA: (worried sigh) Now I'm doubting– No, you know what, maybe I shouldn't trade these.

LIAM: Put them away, put them away.

MATT: Make a deception check. Make a deception check. I would say, you know, if you wanted to–

SAM: Am I assisting?

MATT: You can assist on this, yeah.

TRAVIS: Oh, that's good!

MARY: I'll take some too, as well.

LAURA: What is the assist?

MATT: That gives you advantage on the roll.

SAM: Oh wait, I don't get to roll?

MATT: Huh?

SAM: I don't get to roll anything?

MATT: No, it just gives her advantage.

LAURA: 27.

SAM: (sighs) Oh, that's good.

TALIESIN: That was a really good roll.

WILL: (laughs) That was good.

MATT: He goes, “No, no, no, no. Put them on the table, please. I would like to have a look. Just in casies.”

LAURA: I'll put one of them down so you can look.

MARISHA: As she places it down, can I do a little Gust cantrip and do a little poof of air?

MATT: Sure. Make a sleight of hand check.

MARISHA: Fuck.

LAURA: Aw, man. All the time, Keyleth!

MARISHA: I know. Oh, that's good though, that's good. I'm good, I'm good. Hang on, let me make sure, make a sleight of hand–18.

MATT: 18? Okay. As you sit down (poof), this little like– all the dust on the front, a little of the dampness is (poof).

LAURA: I take my hand away, trembling, like I don't want to give it up.

MATT: “Hmm.” He pulls out a little glass eyepiece, inspects. “The craftsmanship is decent.”

MARY: And as he's doing this, I cast Thaumaturgy and cause the table to start vibrating.

MATT: What are the components on that?

MARY: It says I can cause minor tremors.

MATT: On the spell. What does it say under components?

LAURA: Oh.

LIAM: Knickknacks.

LAURA: Knickknacks is probably the components.

WILL: Components is “V.”

MATT: Visual. Yeah, you don't have to actually do anything to it. It just happens.

SAM: Why did you even–

WILL: Why not, is the question I want to ask.

TALIESIN: Really quickly, while the Thaumaturgy is happening, I'm going to cast Minor Illusion, just go for it.

LAURA: What is happening right now?!

MARISHA: We're stacking the deck, man. We're stacking it.

SAM: Any one of these could fail.

MARISHA: If they all succeed, it's going to be dope.

TALIESIN: I'm going to make a– the image of a beautiful woman briefly appear in the reflection of the object and then vanish. Just a gleam.

MARISHA: That's hot. That's hot.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

MATT: You need to make a sleight of hand check.

TALIESIN: I need to make a sleight of hand check?

LAURA: Don't you fucking fail at this.

LIAM: Roll that Snitch!

LAURA: Natural 20.

TALIESIN: No, but it is a 19.

LIAM: Yeah, gang.

MATT: Okay. So you set down which one of the knickknacks now?

LAURA: Just one of them.

MATT: Which one?

LAURA: Are you asking me as Matt?

MATT: These things that you pulled out of the–

WILL: She puts down knick and holds knack.

MATT: There you go.

LAURA: You literally said I gathered up a bunch of knickknacks worth 750 gold.

MATT: Oh, from that. I'm sorry.

(laughter)

MATT: I thought you were talking about the tea set and the dominoes.

LAURA: No, no, no, literally shitty-ass knickknacks.

MATT: Got you.

MARISHA: No, we wouldn't be handing that shit over.

MATT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

LIAM: This is like matryoshka nesting dolls.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Faberge eggs.

MATT: So what this is, it's like a really, really intricate inkwell that has been made out of gold and bronze. It's stuff you find in a SkyMall, essentially.

SAM: The Pocket Fisherman!

TALIESIN: This is Sting, from Lord of the Rings.

MARY: The One Ring to rule them all.

LIAM: That bass is singing!

MATT: All right, so. As the gust of wind fades, the table begins to shake, and he glances in across the outside of this inkwell amongst a bunch of other random knickknacks scattered around it. He looks at it for a second, this flash in his eyes. He goes, “Hmm. They seem fair enough. I would say, include these in the transaction, I would be willing to drop the cost by about 500 gold pieces? An even 6,000.”

LAURA: Darling. I snatch it away and say, do you have any idea how much these are worth?

MATT: “I do, actually, I'm quite the appraiser. It's part of my business.”

LAURA: I know when somebody's trying to swindle me, darling.

MATT: “Well then, step away. You don't need my business, obviously. Is this how your 'Shiny Manager' deals with your shinies? Or would you wish to deal with this face to face?”

LAURA: Tell you what. Take two thousand off your asking price and we have a deal.

MATT: “That is ridiculous! No.”

WILL: How's your family?

MATT: “What does that mean?”

WILL: Just curious how everybody's doing? Everybody healthy, happy?

TRAVIS: Yeah, are they well? In one piece?

MARY: Have you seen your wife?

MATT: Make an intimidation check. (laughing) With advantage because she's helping.

(laughter)

WILL: Is that a 20?

MATT: Roll a d20 twice and take the higher of the two. Add your intimidation.

TALIESIN: Roll again.

WILL: 19.

TALIESIN: Yay! Wait, wait, no. What's your–?

WILL: Plus intimi– 18.

SAM: Negative one intimidation.

WILL: He's a human cleric, I'm doing my best.

LIAM: Laughter during a game, what a novelty!

MATT: “Um. They're fine. Uh, quite fine. Yes. A thousand gold? Off the asking price?”

LAURA: Two thousand gold off the asking price.

MATT: “That– that's ridiculous. It's not even– what are you–”

WILL: Have you heard him talk about paste?

MATT: “I– 1,300 off the asking price. Nothing more.”

LIAM: I take one of my daggers.

SAM: Oh, Jesus.

LIAM: And looking at him, I stick it in Grog's arm and I drag it down and I never take my eyes off him.

TRAVIS: Neither do I.

TALIESIN: He has a lip collection.

MATT: He's looking, like, over you guys now, towards the thoroughfare.

LAURA: Looking for guards.

MATT: “Ah, um. Perhaps, uh–”

TRAVIS: Keep your voice down.

MATT: “I would need…”

LIAM: There's no magic here, friend.

MATT: “Um.”

LAURA: Fifteen hundred off the asking price.

TALIESIN: Seems fair.

SAM: That seems fair.

WILL: Completely fair.

MATT: “Five thousand gold, knickknacks and ah, we're all good? Yes?”

LAURA: Yes. Five thousand gold.

MATT: “All right, here you are. Please now, it would be wondrous after we complete this transaction that we never meet again.”

LAURA: Oh dear. I'm afraid I've already Hunter's Marked you.

MATT: “I don't even know what that means.”

(laughter)

MATT: There's a person waiting behind you. “Um, excuse me–” “We're closed!”

(laughter)

LAURA: Oh, right, of course, let me count up this little amount right here.

SAM: Kash, Zahra, you should probably contribute.

LAURA: No, that's all right, dear. Five thousand gold.

MATT: “Thank you.”

LAURA: Oh, and here, these very valuable–

MATT: “Good day! Good day.”

WILL: It's been a pleasure.

MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little tulip and give it to her.

MATT: To him?

MARISHA: Him.

WILL: Her now.

MARY: Her now. Kash does have an effect, doesn't he?

MARISHA: Debateable.

MATT: He takes it, confused, and goes–

LAURA: Wait, what potions did we just take?

MATT: You grab the potions that are on the table that he pushed towards you. There is one superior healing–

LAURA: You said there was two superior.

TRAVIS: One superior, two greater, and ten–

MATT: Yes. One superior, two greater, ten regular.

LAURA: That's a good amount.

MARISHA: That's pretty good. I didn't realize there was ten in there.

LAURA: Yeah, it's a lot. Okay, cool.

TALIESIN: And we only had to threaten a shopkeeper with bodily harm to get it.

WILL: I was gonna say, it was the first time I've ever intimidated anybody in my life. It was fun.

(laughter)

WILL: That was fun, I have to admit.

LAURA: You guys– I'm sorry, but we make a pretty good team.

WILL: That wasn't bad. I could get used to that.

TRAVIS: Not that it's like, not for nothing, will you take this fucking dagger out of my arm?

MARISHA: Does this mean we're a terrible influence?

LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on Grog.

TALIESIN: It means you're a good influence or we're a terrible influence on you.

MATT: It would only have been like two points of damage to you, so that would have healed up fine.

SAM: Vex.

LAURA: Yeah?

SAM: He said two superior.

LAURA: He did say two superior. I knew he said two superior! Matt!

MARISHA: Oh, look at that, look at that, look at that!

LAURA: I chase after him.

SAM: I'm coming too.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: No! No! No?

MATT: So you come into the tent after him?

LAURA: Yeah.

LIAM: No, no, it's brilliant. Let it play. Let it play.

LAURA: Actually, dear. Dear? I believe you left one of your potions off the table.

MATT: He turns around. “The superior potions are five thousand gold apiece, baseline.”

LAURA: But you said you had two superior and you said all the potions for the amount we said.

MATT: “I said all the ones I placed on the table before you.”

LIAM: Ah, there's so much blood on this fucking dagger. Ugh.

LAURA: Are you going back on your word?

MATT: “You've made a grand deal with what we said. If you continue to push this, I'm afraid I'm going to have to get the guards.”

LAURA: Eh. Superior's a superior.

WILL: My guess is he couldn't get to the front of the tent by the time we got to him. But that's up to you. We're just guests here.

LAURA: No, it's all right. I know they're expensive. And we've already taken enough advantage.

TRAVIS: Yeah, if they're what they say they are.

LAURA: No!

TRAVIS: That's what I'd do.

LIAM: Cross your fingers.

LAURA: Can I sniff and make sure it's actually a real potion that he gave us? Did he give us fucking fake potions?

MATT: You can go back and take a moment and sniff, yeah. Go ahead and make a perception check.

LAURA: Is it like watered-down gasoline?

MATT: Make a perception check.

LAURA: 23.

MATT: You take it and uncork and sniff. Yeah, it's a very familiar pungent herbal smell of–

WILL: Watered-down gasoline.

MATT: Yeah.

(laughter)

LAURA: Fine. Okay.

TALIESIN: You did very well and there are other things that we should think about purchasing.

LAURA: You're right, you're right, you're right.

SAM: That lady was the worst.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: That lady's the worst.

MARY: Do you need to get gunpowder?

TALIESIN: I could use a bit of a top-up just because who knows when the next time we're going to be in this direction.

SAM: To a pub?

MARY: No, let's go to the gunpowder. Let's get you some.

TALIESIN: And perhaps, considering that we're going to be very mobile, a map would not be the worst purchase.

LAURA: I thought we have a good map of the world.

MATT: You have a fair map of Tal'Dorei and you have what is a basic layout of the continents.

TALIESIN: Don't we have a mapmaker?

MARISHA: We do have a mapmaker. Wasn't he here? Or was he in Emon?

MATT: You met Tyriok here.

MARISHA: Tyriok, yeah, yeah, yeah.

MATT: Though you haven't seen him. He mentioned to you previously he's currently traveling to finish his–

MARISHA: Yeah, that's right. We caught him in the tavern, correct?

MATT: Yes.

MARY: Don't you think the Slayer's Take– should I run back and talk to Vanessa?

WILL: Vanessa has to have maps somewhere.

MARY: She's got to have one somewhere. You need a basic map of Vasselheim, is that what you're speaking of?

TALIESIN: It would not be a terrible thing to have, considering we're going to be traveling.

MARISHA: Of Vasselheim? Or of–?

SAM: The world.

MATT: Othanzia is the larger country set around. The continent is Issylra. Issylra is a very large continent. It's almost the equivalent of Asia and Russia, like that whole– it's very wide and a lot of it is wild and untamed land and wilderness.

TALIESIN: Let me top up a bit on what I need.

LAURA: All right.

TALIESIN: I'll need you as well because you hold the purse strings.

LIAM: Who's got the potions?

MATT: Hmm?

LIAM: Who's got the potions?

LAURA: I have the potions.

SAM: Can I divvy those out, please?

LIAM: Ah, I'm so fast, but I'm really weak. Can I have another one?

LAURA: I already gave you a greater.

LIAM: I know you did. But I get fucked up really easily. Could I have another one?

LAURA: I give– wait, how many people are there? Eight of us.

LIAM: Yeah.

MARISHA: So there was a few regulars, yeah?

LIAM: Just another, one more.

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll give you two normies.

LIAM: Thank you.

LAURA: And everybody else gets a normie as well.

TALIESIN: I'll take a normie.

WILL: Thank you.

SAM: Who gets the supe? And the great?

LAURA: Who's our weakest?

SAM: (clears throat)

LAURA: Yeah, you're pretty weak. Take a greater, Scanlan.

SAM: Yes!

TALIESIN: The two poor decision makers, I imagine.

LIAM: What's that, Smoke Man?

LAURA: Grog, do you want the other greater? Yeah, take the other greater. And then I have one superior. How many hit points does a superior heal?

MATT: A superior heals 8d4 plus eight.

LIAM: That's low.

LAURA: That's not that many. It's 5,000 gold?

MARISHA: Yeah, no. No, healing potions are generally a rip off.

LAURA: What a waste.

MARISHA: I know.

MATT: Oh my god! I just buy healing to save my life! Such a waste!

(laughter)

MATT: Oh my god, there's like a whole trade of really talented magical practitioners that spend their time crafting and brewing up these potions in the hopes they can save your life in the future.

LIAM: What's this character called? What's this character called?

MARISHA: It's true, I did buy a book to learn alchemy, and I just haven't had time to do it.

MARY: It's a great read, trust me.

MARISHA: The alchemy book? Yes?

TRAVIS: Are we fucking buying anything else or what are we doing now?

LAURA: Black powder.

LIAM: He needs the Bang Bang Man.

TALIESIN: Let's go get some powder. Let's get some black powder and whatever else we might–

MARY: Boomstick needs the bang.

SAM: While they're buying powder, I'm going to go get a fucking drink somewhere.

TRAVIS: Ooh! Yeah!

TALIESIN: We'll meet you at the pub.

MARISHA: I'll go with Scanlan and Grog.

WILL: I'm going to go to the pub as well.

LAURA: I'm going with Percy. Go get a drink.

WILL: Okay, I'm going to go to the pub.

TRAVIS: Yeah, you are, you bad, intimidating motherfucker!

SAM: The Abundant Terrace area.

MATT: Yep.

MARISHA: Okay. Are you coming to the pub?

LIAM: No, I'm going to help– no, I'll see you in a bit.

WILL: I'll take care of her. We'll be fine. Don't worry about it.

SAM: Dagon is the owner.

MATT: Correct, yes. The two taverns you've been to is that of the Bellows' Respite Inn, which is in the Braving Grounds. So yeah, you can go to either one of those.

SAM: Oh. Grog, would you rather go to the one near the Braving Grounds?

TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

SAM: Or this one?

MATT: Up to you.

LAURA: Don't start any fights, we have a dragon to kill.

TRAVIS: Come on, shot-caller, pick one.

SAM: Yeah, whatever's closer.

MATT: Closer would be the Bellows' Respite, that's also where the Crucible was, the one that was on the outside of it.

SAM: Let's go.

WILL: Better ale.

MARISHA: Old stomping grounds, Grog.

MATT: So you guys go get drinks. Who's going–?

TALIESIN: Vex and I are going and– are you coming as well?

MARY: How far are we from the Slayer's Take, and is there any other place in town that I personally would know of from being here about three months, to find a map?

MATT: You can go back and ask the Slayer's Take. They have basic maps of the nearby countryside. A lot of the contracts require you to travel across this side of Othanzia. You go back and you talk to Vanessa and you procure one of the maps there that are usually supplied for one of your missions.

MARY: All right, and then I'm going to the bar to get a fucking drink.

TRAVIS: Yes!

MATT: All right, so most of them are drinking. Vex and Percival head– you guys are all heading actually in the same area, to the Braving Grounds outside the Trial Forge, since that's where the bar is and that's also where Victor's little powder-covered hovel is.

LIAM: Bring him out. Bring him out!

MATT: So (laughs) as you approach the same area, you can see that the building is the same as it was before, other than it's missing half a roof.

TALIESIN: He might be a bit low on powder.

MATT: It appears to be haphazardly covered with a series of boards that were nailed to keep things closed, but there is definitely, with the snow and the rain, it's probably not the best place to be staying or living.

TALIESIN: I'm going to remove my coat. As I've learned.

LAURA: Yes?

TALIESIN: Do we have Trinket with us?

LAURA: Yes, of course.

TALIESIN: I'm going to put my coat on Trinket for a moment, just to keep it clean.

LAURA: A walking coat rack, that's what Trinket is.

LIAM: Percy, that's not a good idea.

MATT: Trinket's trying to get the coat off.

TALIESIN: Thank you, Trinket (knocking). Hello?

MATT: Some movement, and you hear the shattering of glass and you hear a (frustrated noise).

TALIESIN: Victor, are you in there?

MATT: “Just a moment!” Suddenly the door, whoosh!, slams open and before you, you see Victor, half covered in soot, has a big old thick pair of glasses on his face, one of which is cracked. You can see his chin now has this puffed out, partially burnt and curled bit of a goatee at the very tip of his chin. He looks up at you with these giant eyes that are projected and magnified by his eyewear. “Can I help you?!”

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Yes, it's Percival. Do you remember me?

MATT: “No!”

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Excellent.

MATT: “Is that all?!”

TALIESIN: I was hoping to procure some black powder again. We had a– we made a deal last time–

MATT: “Yes, yes, come in, please come in!”

TALIESIN: Do I have to? Okay.

MATT: He turns around and heads back inside.

LAURA: I'm going to stand out here.

TALIESIN: That's quite wise. Please keep my jacket clean.

MATT: As you enter, indeed, a good half of the roof is missing and you see now a lot of things have been moved away because currently there is a pile of burnt and destroyed wood splinters that are also soaked through, and there's a little bit of mold and rotten mildew that has gathered in that far corner as well, from the weather.

LIAM: I'm going to stand over here and fail to stay in character, okay?

(laughter)

TALIESIN: You should roll for that. You're looking well.

MATT: “Heh, heh! Mostly.” He turns around and you can see now, what you failed to notice when you first started this is where once there was five, there is now three fingers.

MARISHA: Yes, he has character progression!

(laughter)

TALIESIN: That's impressive.

MATT: “Learn from my mistakes!”

(laughter)

TALIESIN: You can learn three more times, easily.

MATT: “I can. Three, four– yes!” He runs off and starts rummaging through a bunch of stuff.

TALIESIN: Victor, I was hoping you would have some black powder for sale.

MATT: “I'm on it, I'm on it! Hold on!” He whips around with this metallic cylinder that is very well sealed. “See, I learn from my mistakes!”

TALIESIN: That's very impressive. Oh–

MATT: He walks very carefully, very gingerly placing it on the table. “Okay. Carefully.” He pulls out (fwoosh) a small torch. “I have to unseal the metal.”

TALIESIN: Let's not do that! And I make a quick… I'm going to try and bap the thing down as quickly as I can.

MATT: Okay. You smack it out of his hand.

TALIESIN: Let's… I trust you implicitly.

MATT: “Heh heh heh heh. It's coffee.”

(laughter)

MATT: “Black powder.” (cackles)

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I think you've had enough. I'm going to smell the coffee. It's really coffee?

MATT: Yeah. “Sorry, trying to host. It's been a while since I've had a guest. Would you like some?”

TALIESIN: Just one spoonful would be quite–

MATT: He goes over to a small kettle and begins straining it through. He's got this little coffee brew on the side. “So, real black powder. Wait! I do know you.”

TALIESIN: Yes!

MATT: “You've purchased before.”

TALIESIN: I have.

MATT: “Return customer. Not many of those.”

TALIESIN: Not many? Have there been others?

MATT: He pours a couple of cups for you, pulls it over to you. “Oh, one. Months ago.”

TALIESIN: Really? Who would–?

MATT: “Nice woman. Young, good outfit, well dressed, heh.”

TALIESIN: Excellent. She didn't happen to say where she was going, did she? By any chance?

MATT: “No, no. Weeks, not months. Time– strange.”

TALIESIN: Weeks? Very good to know. Thank you, that's so helpful. Did you talk about anything else with this nice young woman, at all?

MATT: “No! She paid well!”

TALIESIN: I'm sure she did.

MATT: “Kept her distance.”

TALIESIN: I'm sure she did as well.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: That's– I'm curious, how have your own experiments been going? Going well?

(laughter)

TALIESIN: You should get that looked at some point. Three more, three more.

MATT: “Three.”

LAURA: Percival?

TALIESIN: Yes! So any black powder that you have, I would be happy to–

MATT: “Yes.”

TALIESIN: Help you pay for a new roof, maybe.

MATT: “Oh, I have to fix that.”

TALIESIN: You do. Money can help.

MATT: “Explains the cold.” He smears black right across the front of his face.

TALIESIN: Doesn't it, though?

MATT: It's like gelled in with whatever mucus had been captured in there as well, streaked across.

TALIESIN: Oh, that's not a mustache. That's so– ugh.

MATT: He comes back and he's now keeping, previously it was out in the open, he's learned his lesson. He has these glass vials, similar to what they put potions in, but now he's filling them with powder. And he brings out about four of them. “This is as much as I will spare. I already sold a lot recently to the lady. I have my own tinkering to do, but if you wish to buy these?”

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: “I would be happy to sell.”

TALIESIN: That would be lovely.

MATT: “Okay. Process of distilling, drying, preparing, 250 gold!”

TALIESIN: I think that's very fair.

MATT: “Wondrous! Deal, deal.”

TALIESIN: Vex?

LAURA: Yes?

TALIESIN: 250 gold, if you'd be so kind.

LAURA: That much?

TALIESIN: I'm going to make you something lovely.

LAURA: (singsong) I love you!

TALIESIN: You're welcome.

MATT: “Hiiii!”

LAURA: H-hi. I give the money to Percy to give to him.

TALIESIN: And I hand it out.

(laughter)

MATT: “Would you like some coffee?”

TALIESIN: Victor! Thank you, you're so kind. And if you would be so lovely as to not mention us to my friend if she should happen back.

MATT: “50 gold.”

SAM: Oh, shit!

LAURA: Tell you what, Victor. I don't think you want to tell her anything.

MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

LIAM: All you need is a five.

LAURA: Wait, wait, wait. 12.

MATT: (laughs) Given the circumstance, he has a really low DC on this, so I'm glad this is the one you rolled a 12 on. He goes, “For you? I saw nothing!”

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I love you, darling.

MATT: He catches it and he grabs a glass vial and puts it in and caps it up.

LAURA: Okay. Keep it safe, dear.

TALIESIN: Until we meet again. All of us. Until we all meet again. Always a pleasure. Ah, keep safe, and–

MATT: “Yes?”

TALIESIN: Keep safe.

MATT: “Will do.”

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: “Bye!” He waves with his three fingers. “Close the door when you're done!”

LIAM: If I may–

(cheering)

TALIESIN: You're welcome, Internet. You're welcome.

LAURA: That was amazing.

LIAM: Oh, man. Hire that fucking fool!

(laughter)

MATT: The rest of you find your way back at the Bellows' Respite Inn where the rest of the party has been drinking.

(cheering)

MARISHA: How'd it go?

MARY: (drunkenly) Wait, wait, wait, wait– okay– okay.

MATT: Wow, you've been drinking.

MARY: Grog, Grog.

TRAVIS: Yeah?

MARY: The first time I ever saw you, you were fighting… the Hammer? Who were you fighting?

TRAVIS: Yep, yep, Hammer, Hammer.

MARY: You were fighting the Hammer. So I went away and I made you… a hammer. And I'm gonna give you the hammer.

TRAVIS: You made me a hammer?!

MARY: I did! That's what I do. I like to forge things.

TRAVIS: Really?

MARY: I do. So I made you a hammer.

LAURA: Does she not drink very much?

WILL: Not very much at all.

TRAVIS: That is amazing! I love hammers!

MARY: And I put my crest on it. It's a moon. It's a full moon.

LIAM: You said she was lush, you didn't say she was a lush.

TRAVIS: Is it like a moon hammer?

MARY: A lovely moon hammer. I want you to have it. I want you to have it.

WILL: Z, you gotta slow down.

MARISHA: No, never!

TRAVIS: You don't– you don't have it now?

MARY: I'll give it to you before we go.

TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

LAURA: I go and I sit next to Kashaw.

LIAM: Keek.

MARISHA: What? Hi.

LIAM: How many of those have you had?

MARISHA: What?

LIAM: Less than five?

WILL: Two or three.

MARISHA: Three? Two, three?

WILL: Enough to where it's fun.

MARISHA: It's blurry. You should join us! You all have to catch up. Come on! Life has been hard! Come on.

MARY: Come on, Burt!

MATT: A barkeep comes by, a human gentleman you recognize from before as Once-Lucky Ned, who had originally given you some information. Comes by, puts the drinks down. “I thought it was you!”

TRAVIS: Yep.

MATT: “Heh, heh. Phillip! Phillip! It's good to see you.”

TRAVIS: No, no, it was– it was Philip before, and now it's Grog.

MATT: “Oh, he beat the name out of you. That's harsh.”

TRAVIS: No, no, no. That was the first time, and then I came back and won my vengeance. Right?

MATT: “Right, right.”

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: “You want to be known as… I see (clicks tongue). I got you.”

TRAVIS: Grog, Grog.

MATT: “Grog the Phillip is in town! Should anyone wish to take the title of the Crucible, this would be the one to talk to. Heh-heh.”

MARY: Woo!

MATT: Faces turn, then go back to business.

MARISHA: Is Zahra the only one that claps?

MARY: Woo! Ooh!

(laughter)

WILL: Oh, Z. Oh, Z.

MARY: Shut up, Kash.

MARISHA: I have missed you guys. I've never met you! But I missed you guys.

MARY: I've missed… you.

TALIESIN: I think we need to catch up a bit. Vax, Vex, let's all have a toast to the inevitability of the universe, please. A cheers.

LIAM: Which one of us? What was that?

TALIESIN: Vex and Vax. We're having a toast to the inevitability of the cosmos.

LAURA: A toast? We're toasting? At a time like this?

TALIESIN: We are.

MARISHA: Look, there's never not a good time to toast.

WILL: Is there a better time to toast than when the world is gonna end?

MARISHA: Exactly.

MARY: We're about to lose everything, we might as well celebrate what we've got.

MARISHA: I toast to celebrating the end of the world with the best friends we could possibly have.

TALIESIN: I'm, I'm, I have something to say to this.

SAM: Oh, Percy, well.

TALIESIN: I have something to say.

MARISHA: All right, Percy, come on.

TALIESIN: When one is born into gentry, one is born with an innate sense of destiny.

(groaning)

TALIESIN: An innate sense that the world is moving in a direction–

SAM: Fuck the dragons!

(laughter)

TALIESIN: We have been given a direction to move to actually defeat our foes. We have been given a sign, we have been given something to move for. There is an inevitability to the goodness of the universe–

TRAVIS: (slurred) Inevitability.

MARISHA: There is something to fight for, damn it!

SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Fuck the dragons!

MARY: Here's to fighting for something more than just money.

TRAVIS: (slurred) Inevitability.

LIAM: I would rather be with you all than the finest people in the world.

MARISHA: Cheers to that, because God knows we're not the finest.

MARY: When you find them, let us know.

WILL: I agree with you about the inevitability of the universe. The inevitability is that it's always shit.

TALIESIN: There's stones that are thrown into the river. There are stones that are thrown upon the river, but the river always moves.

WILL: It's true, but you're not talking about the fish that's killed by the stones that's thrown into the river.

TRAVIS: Can I go and find the barkeep?

MATT: Yeah, Once-Lucky Ned is there.

TRAVIS: Remember, right? It's just Grog. It's not like “Grog the Phillip.” It's just Grog.

MATT: “Oh, I apologize.”

TRAVIS: No, it's all right, it's okay. So, does Earthbreaker Groon, does he ever come in here? Big guy, muscley, long, like, stringy–

MATT: “I know of him. He doesn't come in and drink, no. He spends most of his days over there in that big Trial Forge Temple of Kord.”

TRAVIS: He never comes out?

MATT: “He'll go into the city on occasion. But he's one of them, how do I put it? 'Medititive' types.”

TRAVIS: “Medititive”?

MATT: “Yes. Spends a lot of time thinking. Sleeping while standing up. It's weird.”

TRAVIS: What? I don't understand. How do you do that?

MATT: “You'll have to ask him.”

TRAVIS: “Medititive.”

MATT: “Yes.”

LIAM: Meeting of the minds.

TRAVIS: All right. Is he like–? All right. Thank you.

MATT: “No worries. I mean, if I recall, he actually came and saw your last bout.”

TRAVIS: Yeah, he did! And I want to like go see him, but I don't know anything about “medititiveness,” like sleeping standing up.

MATT: “Go over there to the Trial Forge! He's seen you once, maybe he'll say hello again.”

TRAVIS: What should I, like, bring him a gift?

MATT: “I don't know. I don't ever talk to him.”

TRAVIS: Is anybody here, like, in the room right now behind me? Are they present at the Trial Forge very often? Hey, don't be so obvious.

(laughter)

MATT: “No clue.”

TRAVIS: All right. And I flip him a silver. Bing.

LIAM: That's like half a penny.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: We're just talking (laughs). All right.

SAM: (sighs) What is it, like, noon right now?

(laughter)

TALIESIN: (singing) Day-drinking!

MATT: Well, no, it's probably about 1:30, two o'clock in the afternoon.

MARY: (slurring) Kash and I just got back from frikkin' and it's time to drinkin'!

WILL: We haven't even eaten yet.

MARISHA: Well, (laughs) I lost a fourth of my civilization!

WILL: That is funny.

TRAVIS: Wow. That went dark.

LIAM: I raise the bottom of Keyleth's glass and keep it going.

(laughter)

SAM: Should we find Kima next, or should we spend the day here?

MARISHA: Oh, that's right, we still have work to do.

LAURA: Well, we do have some very inebriated–

LIAM: Yeah, I think we've accidentally gotten shit-faced.

MARY: I can just walk and not do anything.

TRAVIS: Yeah, no, she can manage.

MARISHA: Maybe if we hang here long enough Kima will show up.

LIAM: No. We're drunk. Here's what we should do.

LAURA: I'm not drunk.

LIAM: You ready?

SAM: I'm not drunk.

TALIESIN: I'm not either.

LIAM: We should go watch Grog fight.

LAURA: What? There are dragons in the world, right now! And we're fighting? We're going to watch a fight?

LIAM: We need– listen to me. We need Kima with us, but Kima doesn't have time for fucking drunkards. You might not be, but some of us are a little drunk. So, while that's going on, we wait a day, right? And while that day is going on, we watch Grog pummel some person's face in.

MARISHA: Plus, when I was a little girl, we used to be taught that if you were ever lost in the forest, to stay and hug a tree.

LAURA: Don't hug him, Keyleth.

MARISHA: And someone will come and find you.

WILL: I like this plan.

MARISHA: So if we stay in one place and this ale is like our tree, okay? We hug the ale and Kima will show up. That's my theory.

MATT: While this is happening, Vex, you glance over her shoulder to the entryway to this bar, and you see stepping in, a familiar, burly looking half-orc gentleman.

MARISHA: Damn it, I was hoping it was Kima!

TALIESIN: That would have been hilarious.

MATT: He walks in, wiping his hands from dirt in the mines, stops, looks over at your table. Slowly backs out of the tavern and steps back out into the thoroughfare.

LIAM: Hey, look at that guy who went out the door! He looked like that guy you fought in that ring.

TRAVIS: Really?

LIAM: That guy, yeah. Go get (stammering) do it again.

TRAVIS: Hold on a second. And I run out the door. I run after him, out the door.

MATT: Yeah. Make a perception check.

LIAM: Oh, come on, Grog.

TRAVIS: 18.

MATT: 18. You step out in the front of the tavern, and immediately to the left, you see him ducking into the alleyway.

TRAVIS: Wait! Kern! Kern! And I take off running after him.

MATT: Okay. You turn around the corner and you see his back is against the wall and he has sweat dripping down his brow. “Hi.”

TRAVIS: Hey. Funny seeing you here.

LAURA: I run up behind Grog.

MARISHA: Why are they acting like they fucked?

TRAVIS: Things been good?

MATT: At this point–

WILL: Did you guys date?

MARISHA: They're ex-lovers!

MATT: He looks down. “Still a little sore.”

TRAVIS: Right. Yeah.

MATT: “How about you?”

TRAVIS: When I chew, my jaw goes to one side. It's fucking weird.

MATT: “Yeah.”

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: Are you guys all right, then? Everything's fine?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: All right, I'm going to go, grab a drink.

TRAVIS: So, I meant to ask you, that big, muscly, like long stringy white-haired guy that was watching our last fight.

MATT: “Yeah, yeah. The Earthbreaker.”

TRAVIS: Yeah. Who is he to you?

MATT: “I've seen him around. Haven't really… I talked to him once. I'll level with you. Went to him for a little training after our first fight.”

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: “Um. Says I'm a little too angry to pursue his path.”

TRAVIS: Angry?

MATT: “I got a lot of pent-up rage the way I was raised.”

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Family issues? Tell me about it.

MATT: “Tell me about it. (chuckles) Well, half my folks are bloodthirsty, wandering barbarians in the Northern Wastes.”

TRAVIS: No way!

(laughter)

MATT: “Yeah. What, you think being a half-orc's great? No! It's bullshit!”

TRAVIS: I know! You think goliath is any better? It's the same fucking thing!

MATT: “At least you're made for this weather! It's cold out here!”

TRAVIS: That's true, it is fucking cold out here.

MATT: “Yeah, it is.”

TRAVIS: I can only imagine. I'm really sorry I took your lip off, by the way.

MATT: “Sorry I took yours off, too.”

TRAVIS: That's true. Mine healed better.

MATT: “Yeah.”

TRAVIS: Hey, so. When you trained with him, because you were doing all that yoga pilates stuff. Did it help you out?

MATT: “Well, obviously not, really.”

TRAVIS: Right. What did he ask in exchange for the tutorial?

MATT: “He didn't ask for any pay. He–”

WILL: Oh god, what did he ask for?

MATT: “He told me I had–”

SAM: (mutters) Pretty eyes.

MATT: “–to help someone.”

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Help someone.

MATT: “He still hasn't given me the proper details yet and he hasn't called in the debt, but he told me one day, I was to help him test someone, and he'd train me.”

TRAVIS: In that Trial Forge, are there like, more of him, like a bunch of big, jacked-out guys in there?

MATT: “Not as big as him, no. But there's plenty of others that train under him. All sorts of warriors. Weapons of all kinds. It's Kord!” He looks over, and you see in the distance, the giant statue of Kord that sits atop the Trial Forge. He looks over and with a look of reverence, gives a nod, and you can see that this man, a glimmer of faith in his eyes. He himself probably a follower of Kord as well. “He's a great man. I'm not the right temperament, it seems. But that's fine. He's getting along okay.”

TRAVIS: Right. I won't take up too much more of your time, but if I could ask you one last thing. Aside from the Slayer's Take and the Trial Forge, if you had to find men at arms, men to attack a very large foe, possibly quite dangerous, where would you go?

MATT: “Probably the Platinum Sanctuary. Between them and the Trial Forge, that's most of the actual army. Most of it's Trial Forge. It's part of what the Braving Grounds are about. They train the armies here, it's where they breed warriors.”

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: “Most of the Bastions that look over the city are trained here, so it's– those are my best bets, at least. Not much of a political man.”

TRAVIS: Well, it's been good seeing you. No one hit quite as hard as you did.

MATT: “You too. Um. The medal was a joke. I was in a sore place. Literally, a very, very sore place.”

TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

MATT: “I wanted to apologize for that.”

TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

MATT: “I should go.” He starts walking past you, out into the main street.

TRAVIS: Kern. Kord's strength to you, my friend.

MATT: He doesn't even look back to you. “Uh, you too!” and keeps walking.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Wow. Wow.

TRAVIS: I go back into the tavern.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Did you kill him, Grog?

TRAVIS: Yep, yep, there's a lot of pieces of him all over the alley!

SAM: That's my boy.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I like, left nothing to find. It's great.

SAM: All right.

LAURA: I walked out and they were making out.

TRAVIS: Shut the– that is not what we were doing.

LAURA: Mugging down in the alleyway.

MARISHA: Ooh, Grog! I didn't know you swung that way.

TRAVIS: Swung what way?

MARISHA: Toward– never mind.

SAM: Swung your axe.

MARY: Could I have another cup of coffee here?

MATT: “Of course, coming your way.”

LIAM: No man's– you know– goes straight on. Goes a little bit to the left, a bit of–

WILL: Some men go straight on.

LIAM: I go sit down next to Kash.

LAURA: I sit down next to the other side of Kash, in between him and Keyleth.

TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and watch right next to you.

MATT: All right.

MARISHA: (yelling) Another drink!

LAURA: How about, Keyleth, not another drink.

MARISHA: What?

LAURA: How about you have some water, dear.

MARISHA: Mm, it's been a long few weeks.

MARY: Come here, Keyleth darling, we'll get some coffee.

TALIESIN: No coffee for me, thank you.

LIAM: Excuse me, if I may. All I want to say is that you are a very impressive man in many ways. You are handsome and capable.

LAURA: Your eyes are two different colors, which is very interesting.

LIAM: That's a little creepy, but other than that, you are very, very capable– Percival, I'm having trouble focusing, so if you could sort of go behind Kash.

WILL: I don't know what's happening. I don't know what's happening. Is he hitting on me? What's happening?

LIAM: No, no. No, no, no, no. There's only one man for me.

WILL: What?

LIAM: All I'm saying is–

MARY: What man is that?

LIAM: (slurring) We could use your help, all right? I know you're a bit of a mercenary, but you are a very capable man and there is a lot at stake. There is a lot at stake. There are dragons, they killed– I'm not going to get into it. But I implore you to look past yourself and please try to think of the greater world. (stuttering) I'm an admirer–

WILL: You've said several times that you're an admirer of mine.

LIAM: Yes.

WILL: Very sweet.

LIAM: Also, one last thing.

WILL: Mm-hmm?

LIAM: You know what, never mind. I don't want to talk about that. And I wander off into the other side of the room.

WILL: I have literally no idea what just happened.

SAM: (laughs) He's a complicated man. He goes to dark places.

LAURA: Keyleth. Maybe you should go see what's happening?

LIAM: (muffled) It's dark in this closet!

MARISHA: What?

LAURA: Go, maybe you should go see what is going on with my brother? Maybe you should go find out what's happening with my brother.

LIAM: How do you get this closet door open? I can't get back out here.

LAURA: He's stuck in a closet.

MARY: It's all right. Girl talk. So, Keyleth.

MARISHA: What. What. What?

MARY: I heard a little. I wasn't sure and I then saw you and I thought oh, all right, well, you know, yeah, all right. So, what, you know? With the what? (whispers) What happened? With him?

MARISHA: I literally never even had this experience in high school, it's throwing me.

MARY: (whispers) Come on.

MARISHA: I don't know how to react to any of this.

LIAM: What is high school?

LAURA: Keyleth. She's talking about you kissing Kash.

MARY: Yeah.

MARISHA: Oh! Right! Oh!

MARY: He told me. He told me a little bit.

MARISHA: Funny you mention that, yeah, you know–

LAURA: Wasn't he your first kiss?

MARY: Do you like him?

LAURA: Isn't that so wonderful?

MARY: I know, it's wonderful. Do you like him?

MARISHA: I, um, you know, okay, I'm kind of new to all of this. I don't really know what's going on?

MARY: What, to talking? You're doing very well.

MARISHA: Thank you. I'm new to that as well.

MARY: No!

MARISHA: Um–

LAURA: I'll give you a helpful hint.

MARISHA: Okay. Yes.

LAURA: If you're interested in someone, make sure they know.

MARISHA: (breathless) Oh.

LAURA: And if you're not, then stop fucking dragging them along, because it's not fair.

MARY: What if she doesn't know? What if she can't decide?

MARISHA: Oh, you think I'm dragging Kash along? Oh no no no no no.

LAURA: Sure. You're dragging Kash along.

MARISHA: I mean, he was just, I only spent a day with him.

LAURA: Mmm.

MARISHA: It was just a day.

LIAM: Vex! I can't get out of this closet.

WILL: Jesus.

LAURA: Is he really, truly stuck in a closet? Right now?

MARISHA: I thought he was a lockpick.

LAURA: (laughing) I go, I walk away.

LIAM: (mournfully) I rolled a one.

MARISHA: This is literally the only thing Vax is good at. He really can't get out of the closet?

TALIESIN: I just want to say, I don't think the dragons stand a chance.

(laughter)

WILL: We've got them now!

LIAM: I can't get out of this closet as hard as I try.

LAURA: What are you doing? Stop it.

MARISHA: Seriously though (quietly) I'm really confused.

MARY: I know, don't hurt him. He's wonderful.

MARISHA: Kash?

MARISHA: Okay.

MARY: He's wonderful.

MARISHA: Okay.

MARY: If you do– he's wonderful.

TALIESIN: My god, I love other people's problems.

SAM: This is amazing. Sorry about this, Kash.

WILL: No, this has been wonderful.

SAM: When our party gets–

WILL: I have men and women telling me I'm incredible.

TALIESIN: You are very attractive.

WILL: That's, wow, that's two.

SAM: I just met you, and I don't know much about you, but are you more of a Vax man or a Vex man? Like, how do you roll? How do you–?

WILL: I don't, again, I don't know what that means.

(laughter)

SAM: Would you be interested in the rogue or the ranger?

LIAM: We're identical.

WILL: Oh. Oh! I see what you're saying. All right, I get it. I go taco, not hot dog.

SAM: Okay.

TRAVIS: Yes! I love taco!

SAM: High five it.

TRAVIS: Respect. Respect.

LAURA: Are we sober yet? Can we go find Kima?

MARY: Yes, we're sober!

LIAM: I think we need to go to bed.

MARY: Yes. Let's get a break.

MATT: After a brief time of coffee and a bit of sobering, you find yourselves of sound enough mind.

LIAM: 17 hours later?!

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Coffee, coffee.

MARY: I metabolize things very quickly, you'd be surprised.

MATT: A few hours, two hours, let's say. It's four, five o'clock in the afternoon.

MARISHA: Five o'clock?

TALIESIN: Or four o'clock. Four o'clock.

MATT: As you, sobering up, the coffee's helped. You find yourself clear of mind to continue onto your intended events for the day. With that, we're going to go ahead and take a break. We'll be back here–

(cheering)

WILL: (laughs) Dragons don't stand a chance!

(laughter)

WILL: (laughs) That was awesome.

MATT: All right, guys, we'll see you here in a few minutes. Thank you.

(laughter)

LIAM: That was great. Man.
Break

[break]
Part II

MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, before we get back into this, a couple quick announcements. One, if we get to 15,000 subscribers tonight, tomorrow's crew will be celebrating 15k and a Cosplay Day. All of our crew will be dressing up as their favorite characters all night. So you guys should go ahead and see if we can hit that number, because that would be awesome and hilarious and awesome.

LAURA: I might have heard what some people are going to be dressing up as and I'm very excited about it.

MATT: I heard a couple, too. You guys would enjoy it, so make it happen, please. I want to see it. Also, a reminder that if you want to help support the channel, check out the Geek and Sundry Amazon Wish List. You can find the list in chat if you type “!Wishlist” there and that will give you access to it and you can see if there's any way you want to help build the channel and make it more awesome. So there's that. Liam will join us when he can. But we're going to jump in for the time being. So, as you guys exit the tavern, you look out into the Braving Fields.

TALIESIN: I suddenly remember to go back and open the closet.

MARISHA: Oh shit, we need to get the rogue out of the closet.

MATT: There is that, yeah. So you're in the center of the Braving Grounds– we traded Liam for Travis.

LAURA: Yeah. I don't know.

MATT: Exactly.

LIAM: Grog, can you get this door open?

(laughter)

MARY: It is open, darling. Come on.

SAM: Are we going to Kima now, or are we going to go see Grog fight?

LIAM: Is Grog fighting?

MATT: To your left, around the Heaven's Stair, the giant mountain that bisects the northern portion of Vasselheim, around that way, a little bit of travel, but that heads towards the Bahamut section of the city, where the Platinum Sanctuary is. To your vision, immediately outside the tavern, you can see the giant statue of Kord, where the Trial Forge is. And to the south of you is where the Quadroads are, in the southern regions. What do you guys want to do?

TRAVIS: I don't really feel like fighting. I just want to go talk to Master Splinter at the Trial Forge.

SAM: Sure, sure. All right, we can do that another day, maybe? Or do you want to–?

TRAVIS: I'm not in a rush.

LAURA: Should we go to the Platinum Sanctuary? Where Kima is, right?

TALIESIN: Let's go talk to Kima.

LIAM: Yeah, right now.

LAURA: Oh, should we wait until some people are more sober?

MARY: No, I'm all right, coffee helps. Coffee helps.

LAURA: Walking will help.

MARY: Walking and coffee.

SAM: Maybe we should– they can wait outside or something.

MARISHA: But I miss Kima.

TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

MATT: It's been a few hours, and you guys have had some coffee, so you're still a little tipsy, but you're not useless.

(laughter)

MATT: To put it nicely. All right, so where do you guys want to head into–?

LAURA: The Platinum Sanctuary.

MATT: All right, you guys make your way south, southwest around the curvature of the base of the Heaven's Stair. You can see up along the mountain itself, large, ominous, this monolith of earth that looks over the entirety of Vasselheim. You can see embedded in the rock itself, there are various homesteads toward the base. As you look up, you can see there's a number of stairways that just spiral around in different directions. You can see small cliffs and precipices that are built on the outside and look to be either various places of individual worship where statues are just barely visible, cresting on the edge. There's a number of constructs, just built into this mountain, that are probably as old as the city itself. You make your way around the south portion of it back into the actual area of Vasselheim, the Silver Talon's Reach, which is where largely Bahamut's worship occurs. You make your way past the scattered temples, all the different huts and hovels that build the central residential real estate to this territory. There are a few homes here that look a little bit like– this town is built on existing in hardship and difficulty, so a lot of people here are just stern folk that live amongst terrible weather and money and wealth isn't really presented or flaunted in this city. It's considered in very poor taste as everyone here is in some way, shape or form, to some level, is pious to some degree to one of the deities that are worshipped here. You find your way to the base of the stair that you recall, following when you first arrived here in Vasselheim, that leads up to the Platinum Sanctuary where you were delivering the Horn of Orcus originally.

TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

MATT: You follow it up the side and it is an extended staircase that curves up to these three silver spires that are pushing out from the side of the mountain, quite a ways up. After about almost 20 minutes of stair climbing, your legs start to cramp a bit, but you manage to make your way towards the top, the outside of the large stone doors. There you can see there are two Scalebearers of Vord, in their silver armor, blue cloaks at their back, weapons at the ready, just looking out. And as soon as you guys approach the top of the stairway, they change their stance to be a little more prepared.

MARISHA: (panting) Guys, this is hard to do with alcohol in your system.

WILL: Hard to do at all.

LIAM: A lot of horses and chickens around here, too.

WILL: I noticed that as well.

LIAM: Everywhere.

MARISHA: I didn't know this was a farming industry.

SAM: Hello there. Excuse us. We are of the Slayer's Take– Is that a good thing?

LAURA: Yes.

SAM: We are of the Slayer's Take and we ask for entry into your Platinum Temple.

MATT: “Your business is with whom?”

LAURA: Lady Kima.

MATT: Turns, nods to the other guy. They both grab these small handles and give a tug, and the door opens slightly and one of the guys disappears between the two doors. About 30 seconds pass to a minute, before he steps back out. “Your presence has been accepted by the Highbearer Vord, the Silvertouched. He will greet you in the central chamber, please.”

SAM: Thank you. How do we address him?

MATT: “Highbearer would suffice.”

SAM: All right.

MATT: “Please enter.”

LIAM: Will Kima be there?

MATT: He doesn't answer. The doors open even wider.

LIAM: Hey!

MATT: So as you guys enter the chamber once more, this is close to where you flew in in bird form and almost got arrested by the Highbearers.

MARISHA: Uh-huh, right, those guys.

MATT: So, as you enter the chamber, you see a number of the guards have already assembled and they're giving you a walkway path, both as a presentory arrival vigil, but also making sure that you don't wander off the predestined path to the main central meeting chamber.

WILL: But it doesn't seem antagonistic in any way.

MATT: No. Just– they're protecting their temple.

SAM: We'll make it that, though.

MATT: You guys continue inward, towards the central chamber, the high stone ceiling before you. You can see there are holes carved throughout the ceiling and the stonework that cause beams of light to come shooting through from the sky. What catches your interest in here is that the sky is cloudy. There is no specific source of direct sunlight, yet there are beams of light within the temple itself that form a pattern across the stone marble floor of the central chamber.

MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

MATT: Certainly.

LAURA: What's the pattern look like?

MATT: The pattern resembles a large shield, when you look at it. It's pointed toward the base of where you guys are walking in and fills most of the chamber in an oval fashion, before coming together in a line towards the back.

MARISHA: 17.

MATT: 17? Okay, this definitely isn't a natural occurrence. The sunlight should not be projecting this way, which leads you to believe that there's something about the temple's enchantment or its construction that can either dissipate the veil of clouds to the sunlight or produce their own light to mimic it during all hours.

MARISHA: Cool.

WILL: Do any of us recognize the symbol on the floor?

MATT: You've seen– the shield itself is akin to the symbol of Bahamut, which is a shield with a silver dragon head on it. You've seen Kima use it previously when you guys were looking after her in the Underdark.

LAURA: We never got that stuff back.

SAM: Her stuff?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: As you guys push to the central chamber, you can see there's a line of three heavily armored Knights of Bahamut that are all there, standing shields at the ready, big tower shields that almost touch the ground. Two of them separate to one side and one separates to the other, and in the center, arriving before you, is Highbearer Vord, the Silvertouched, who some of you are seeing for the first time. Long, light brown hair that crests down past his shoulders, his features are very elven, very soft and ageless, but there is a very faint bluish hue to his skin. His eyes have no irises, no pupils. Steps forward and extends his hands. “It is good to see such friends, so I ask you once again to join me in this chamber. Can I help you?”

LIAM: (whispers) Yes.

LAURA: You can, actually. Well, we hope that you can, as it concerns dragon matters. We know that you serve Bahamut, the great, the wonderful, the very metallic. These very terrible colored– chromatic red, green, lots of different dragons, they've attacked–

SAM: How much do you know about the dragon attacks that have been raging across the world?

MATT: He looks about the rest of you, with a discerning glance, just spending a beat on each of you, almost like you're being judged and read in that instant. You feel as if someone is prying into your personality with but a glance, and it's unsettling at first, but nothing too invasive, just enough to catch you off guard. As he finishes the sweep of the party at hand: “I was given a vision in the night of a far city of man, swathed in ice and flame, of colors bonded and unleashed. And I feared it was the work of our lord's nemesis.”

LAURA: Straight-up nemesis?

MARISHA: Yes, can you elaborate?

MATT: He puts his hand up.

MARISHA: Sorry.

MATT: “However, with much prayer of mine and my acolytes, we find no tremor of the Dragon Queen, nor the stench of Baator, on this business.”

MARISHA: Dragon Queen Baator? Is that what he said? Baator?

MATT: Baator. B-a-a-t-o-r.

MARY: Is the Queen– I'm sorry– are the Queen and Baator the same?

MATT: Make a religion check.

LAURA: All of us or just–?

MATT: All of you, sure. Make a religion check.

LAURA: 20!

MARISHA: Ten.

LAURA: 12.

MARY: 15.

TRAVIS: 18!

WILL: 24.

LIAM: 13.

TALIESIN: 13.

WILL: 24.

MATT: Okay. None of these ring a bell, except for you, Kashaw. The Dragon Queen is indeed the nemesis of the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut. It is an entity known as Tiamat and is essentially the patron of most chromatic dragons. She resides in Baator, which is one of the Nine Hells.

LAURA: Eugh.

MATT: However, it seems that Vord is speaking in a way that, through much disturbed interest and prayer into this matter, there doesn't seem to be the scent of Tiamat's doing in this matter. And strangely, you see a bit of the tension in his face relax as he tells you this.

LAURA: So, if it's not the nemesis, the big nemesis, then you guys could probably take out these dragons, like, no problem, since they're not the Big Bads, they're just really bad.

MATT: “While these entities do concern us, there is the alternate vow that we've spoken, and that is to protect Vasselheim. The city has stood as long as it has because we have not left our post. And the moment that we were to attempt to move even a minority of our people in the city to be of aid to you in this endeavor, this would be the moment that the Dragon Queen will be waiting for to attack our citadel. There are many more forces beyond these dragons that you speak of in this world, bent against the destruction of this city. And we stand because we hold vigil here.”

MARISHA: But, sir, you should understand how close this destruction came from your doorstep.

MATT: “And yet it avoided our city. Do you know why? Because even such creatures know better than to lend their talons against us.”

MARISHA: But how do you know that will happen the next time? Is that always where you're going to place your bet?

MATT: “Do you think this will be the first time that ancient dragons have attempted to attack our fair city?”

MARISHA: How about four?

MATT: “I can guarantee you, should they mount an attack on us, four or not, they will fall.”

LAURA: Wow, then I guess everybody in the world can just move here.

WILL: Wait a second, you said dragons have attacked before and they were defeated. How?

MATT: “Well, we had the aid of Bahamut with us at that time.” And he glances up and you look up and you can see the rays of sun that have come through here, from your current position, you can see actually form a matching symbol. Not of a shield, but of a giant winged dragon outstretched across the curved roof of this temple.

LIAM: But let's talk about–

LAURA: He's saying something.

MARY: Please continue, I'm so sorry.

LIAM: My bad.

WILL: We've been drinking.

MATT: “Drinking?”

WILL: No. Water. Long walk up.

MATT: “Well, understand. I hear your plight. And I understand that we must aid you in this endeavor, best that we can. But we cannot swear to you our army.”

LAURA: What sort of aid can you offer, then?

MATT: “Well, now, while you seek out whatever your plot is to tear these creatures from their summit, we will grant to you, from our place in the Dawn City, our finest champion. While I have no resources to offer at this time, this champion shall come to your aid to help in any way that they can. And once they can report their certainty that victory can be had, perhaps we may be able to send a little more of our power your way.”

SAM: Will we know the presence of this champion or will it be a silent one?

MATT: “The champion is here.” And he steps aside and puts his hand out. And one of the armored knights steps forward, full armor, this tall, wide-chested masculine form. You can't see the face, the helmet protects it, but the shield comes out and slams the ground and goes to kneel on one knee. “Your charge, Platinum Knight Udire, one of our finest warriors, whom has had time and time again–” At which point you hear a loud (clang) sound as all of a sudden, Udire's thrown off of his feet, his shield bent in and skidding across the ground. You see stepping up behind, a female halfling, scar across the face–

LAURA: Fuck yeah!

MATT: – gold-trimmed armor, blue cloak behind her, shouting out, “Oh no, you don't! This is my home turf! I'm going.”

LAURA: Kima!

MARISHA: Yeah, Kima!

TALIESIN: We'll take that one.

MARISHA: We want that one.

MATT: Highbearer Vord rolls his eyes and sighs loudly. (growls) “Kima, you are in need of discipline and guidance. More than most who walk the Warrior's Path! Your foolish impulses will get you killed!”

MARISHA: I think her foolish impulses are exactly what Vox Machina's looking for.

MATT: She grins as she swings her maul, slams it onto the stone ground, a little bit of a rumble as you see a flash of divine energy from that. And a beam from the sky comes down and frames her form as she stands there clutching the top of it. “Better to die a fool for something than live in regret for doing nothing.”

TRAVIS: Church!

(laughter)

MATT: An awkward pause as Udire gets back up on his feet and pulls up the front of his helmet. You can see there's a very thin pencil 'stache underneath. A chiseled jaw and a man who looks like probably an intense, chivalrous-type knight gentleman, except there's a look of complete disdain and frustration. He gets up and goes, “Really, her?!” Vord raises his hand and grumbles. “Very well. Your new charge is Lady Kima, whom you are already affiliated. Please keep her from doing anything stupid.”

SAM: I think we want her to do her stupidest. Udire, it would have been a swell adventure with you, maybe next time. Sir, thank you for granting us this aid that we will definitely need in our journey. We also are new to this dragon-slaying business and would love your advice and any information you might have, especially about some specific items. Something called the Vestiges of Divergence?

MATT: His eyes squint for a moment as he puts his hands in front of his face. “Hmm. To step against such powerful dragons is indeed a death sentence. It's true that you need to prepare, arm yourselves against this doom. While we are meant to stay here in the most holiest of places, these relics you speak of from before the Second Spark still lie forgotten. Hmph, these elements even balked the Primordials of old, blades that slew the Children of the Dark. Where these relics lie, only story and tome can tell, unfortunately. Know that at any given time, you are not the only ones seeking this power. Consider things of such great strength are perpetually in the minds of those who would make their riches off of them or intend to take their own townships and peasantry under their own boot and gauntlet. Well…”

MARY: Do these Vestiges help you control the dragons? Do you become their leader if you find them?

MATT: “I don't believe any of that such capability, but I also am not a scholar of ancient magics and artifacts. I have merely come across their whispers in books and various classes I took as a child.”

LAURA: What sort of books? Fairy books?

MATT: “There are tomes scattered throughout the city. And there is the Cobalt Reserve.”

LAURA: Cobalt Reserve is gone. The dragons took it out.

MATT: “That is unfortunate.”

MARISHA: You said these tomes might still be in Vasselheim?

MATT: “Perhaps.”

MARISHA: Where?

MATT: “I wish I could tell you. We had one such entrusted to us long ago, but that was destroyed as part of the last assault on Vasselheim that we withstood.”

LAURA: Do you remember the description of any of the items from your stories?

SAM: Or how many there were?

MATT: “The stories say of at least a dozen. I can't be certain. I wish I could be of more aid in this, but this is not a path that I chose to learn much on.”

MARISHA: And are all artifacts necessary to defeating these dragons?

MATT: “I have no idea.”

LAURA: We should probably have asked–

MARISHA: Osysa.

MATT: “Though the warriors that once wielded these in the battles of old only seemed to have carried one or two each.”

MARY: How did you defeat them? The dragons that came to your doorstep?

MATT: “That was before my time, my dear.”

MARY: There are no legends, there are no scrolls that might recount the tale of how that happened, that you might still have somewhere?

MATT: “Depends. The Second Spark. Hmm.” He takes a moment to gather his thoughts as I take a moment to gather my notes.

(laughter)

WILL: While you're doing that, Udire's stuck in his armor over there.

TRAVIS: Dented in.

WILL: He's just dented in, he can't get out.

MATT: He's not happy at all about that.

Hold on. Got it.

LAURA: Sorry. One moment please.

MARY: Right here, hold on.

LIAM: I've got all my dragon lore over here. Just give me a second.

MATT: “It's a long tale, and I recommend you research the history yourself, but during the times of creation, when the gods first came upon this world, it was a place of chaotic energies, elements clashing. The very landscape itself was in eternal turmoil, wrestling for no purpose other than the destruction of the others. There were no boundaries. Yet the gods still came, and they created us, the various beings and entities. As they came to understand what their purpose was, as they themselves were still uncertain as to why they came to be, they hoped that through their creations, they could learn more about themselves. They began to watch the first burgeoning elves, dwarves, people. Within a short time, a very short time, the very chaotic nature of this landscape consumed and destroyed most of what remained. The only city that stood, the first city: Vasselheim. The titans that walked across these lands, great, primordial elemental kings, beings of no noble mind, sought to destroy any light or beauty. Thus the first war began. The peoples rose up, the gods' feet touched the ground, and alongside their creations they slew the titans, with the first of these Vestiges. Laying them to rest within the dirt, within the sky, casting the elements away from this plane, and separate to their own, where now they remain, amidst fire, earth, air, water, and their muddy boundaries between. Thus came a time of great privilege and prosperity. And it also came to be discovered that some of the gods, as part of creation during this bout with the titans, began to question the purpose of creation, to embrace the chaos that they fought in this battle, and they distanced themselves from the ones that guide us to this day. They began to take the children of the gods, to corrupt them, teach them the wonders of arcana, magics beyond the divine, the gifts of the gods, and for the first time, the creations began to find power separate from the creators. The arrogance to think that perhaps, now, they were gods themselves. Now, they were the gods' creations and they loved them very much, so they did not see this as a threat. But as the second expansion of civilization spread across the world, we saw rise great, new towns and cities and civilizations and cultures, as well as a new wave of insolence and selfishness. And these new dark gods began to prey upon this, and build a force to take those who still stay true to the first. This terrible war, this is what we knew as the Divergence. This is when the people were split in two. The gods were divided as well. Bloody battles ensued. And it looked as though, while all other cities fell into ruin, even Vasselheim would fall. But in this time, these Vestiges were expanded upon, those first few weapons, many more were created. And the Champions fought alongside the gods once more. And victory was had, the dark gods banished to various planes, far from this plane. But it was then the gods also decided that perhaps their delving had caused this, and they receded, leaving the mortals to find their own way, to rebuild a second time, with the warning of the dangers of arcane, which Vasselheim still to this day holds in its prime oaths. Many of these Vestiges that you seek were destroyed, but some were kept, some were lost, some were entombed, some were re-found and rediscovered and used as symbols of power. But since this Second Spark of civilization, the gods felt that the true penance was the destruction of all their people had built, and the gods leaving us to our own. Thus started the Penance, where to this day, we still make up for the infractions and sins of our arrogant brothers and sisters of that day. So, since then, we've had other new civilizations spring up: Wildemount, Tal'Dorei, Syngorn, Marquet. These are the newer cities of the Third Age.”

LIAM: May I ask– Vestiges, the word in these legends, it seems vague. Does no one know anything about what they were? Is that a stand-in for things we don't understand or know about? What are these Vestiges?

MATT: “We know of them. Understand, artifacts and relics of this power are very dangerous. And what better way to hide things of such power than to destroy the knowledge of where they may be or even if they exist?”

MARISHA: Sir, I come from the Ashari people.

MATT: “Yes.”

MARISHA: We are here to protect those boundaries that we set several thousand years ago. Do you think that some of this knowledge might still be within my people?

MATT: “It is possible. I am not a practitioner of the history of the Ashari people.”

WILL: Objects with that much power have to leave some trace somewhere. Anything you can think of, a place to start.

MATT: “Cobalt Reserve. There the monks keep some of the most ancient of texts. We here at Vasselheim keep a watchful eye on things that relate to the wars of old, the history of our deities, of our temples, to not repeat the mistakes we have. The monks are more eclectic in their collections. Perhaps they can be of more aid.”

LAURA: Maybe not all of the Reserve was destroyed. Maybe they have secret rooms underground, where they keep the most ancient texts. We should at least check.

TALIESIN: It would be worth looking, at the very least.

LAURA: Allura was on her way there.

SAM: Highbearer. These dragons who are running rampant across the world, them being chromatic dragons, do you think they have pledged their loyalty to the Queen?

MATT: “If they have, it's a very– no, they would not be able to shroud the sight of the Platinum Dragon himself.”

LAURA: Isn't it very strange for dragons to pledge their allegiance to any other dragon?

MATT: “For chromatics, it is.”

LAURA: Then why are they serving the red one?

MATT: “The red one?”

TRAVIS: The Cinder King.

LAURA: Thordak.

MARISHA: That's what he calls himself.

LAURA: He's ancient. He was in the Fire Realm– the Fire Plane and broke free. And now he has other dragons serving him.

MATT: “Chromatic dragons respond to a few things: gold, dominance, and strength. If this red dragon is as ancient and as powerful as you say, perhaps he, even he, could bully lesser dragons.”

MARISHA: Or do you think it's possible he is offering any one of those rewards?

MATT: “There are many possibilities. You would have to ask one of them yourself.”

TALIESIN: I get the distinct feeling we will get that chance.

MARISHA: So, if this is the Third Age, does that mean the Fourth is upon us?

MATT: “I hope not.”

MARISHA: As do I.

MATT: “But if it does, we will do everything we can to see that this city stands. It is the only link we have to the past. Should Vasselheim fall, I dare say all is lost.”

MARY: At the cost of everything else, Vasselheim stands? That's my only question.

MATT: “That is your question?”

MARY: Yes.

MATT: “From here, civilization could spring anew. People could defend themselves and thrive thereafter. The rest of the world is scattered. Petty squabbles, selfish personal endeavors that lead to foolishness and treachery. Should this city fall, and one of those remain, that is a breeding ground for the dark powers that lie beyond the Veil. It is only here that those who are the most devout could truly have the hearts and minds to guide us, Bahamut forbid, into a Fourth Age.”

SAM: Well, thank you for all your help. One more question before we leave you to your–

MATT: Which you see, Kima slams her hammer on the ground. “Oh my god! Can we just go? I'm sick of hearing him rattle on.” Vord puts his hand out. “Kima!”

SAM: On our journey, we may have to travel long distances quite often. Is there any means of quick travel to other parts of the continent from Vasselheim?

LAURA: Perhaps any flying carpets that you have lying around?

SAM: Airships, teleportation circles, any means that you know.

MATT: “We do not deal in such teleportation magics beyond the divine-provided ones, and those I assume are beyond most of you. However, there is still the Skyport, which I believe you arrived in when you first came to us? Other than that, if none among you are able to achieve any sort of distance translocation, then I highly doubt you have the ability to stand up against these dragons you seek to destroy.”

MARISHA: We got it. It's fine. It's handled.

LAURA: Thank you for the vote of confidence.

TALIESIN: I think we have everything we need here.

LAURA: Yes, unless you have any amulets or magical things lying around?

SAM: How's that Horn of Orcus going, by the way?

MARISHA: Good question, actually.

MATT: “Shh!”

SAM: Oh, sorry.

TALIESIN: Ix-nay on the orn-hay.

SAM: Sorry.

MATT: “And with that–”

LAURA: So no on the magic items? Of protection?

MATT: “I have business for the day.”

LAURA: Cool.

WILL: I'm not going to ask him how his family is.

SAM: No, don't do that.

MATT: “Show our guests out, please.” “With pleasure.” Slings her maul up on her shoulder. “Let's step outside first.”

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: And she leads you all outside, the temple doors close. As soon as the doors close, she tells the two guards, “Shove off, please. We have to have a conversation.” The guards kind of frustratedly turn around and go back and close the door. As soon as the doors close behind them, she goes, “Oh my god, guys!”

(cheering)

MATT: She rushes out, gives hugs to everyone that she knows. She skips you, asks to be introduced to– “And–”

LAURA: Zahra. Kima.

MARY: I'm Zahra.

MATT: “Zahra, nice to meet you.”

MARY: Nice to meet you, Kima.

MATT: “Kima. Lady Kima.”

MARY: Lady Kima. Lady. All right.

MARISHA: And have you met Kash? Kashaw.

WILL: Kashaw. Vesh.

MATT: “Hmph.”

WILL: All right then.

MATT: “You're brooding.”

WILL: Don't mean to be. It's been a rough– yes. Thank you.

(laughter)

MATT: “All right, so. I caught some of that discussion. Dragons? What are we after here?”

SAM: Big scary dragons.

MATT: “I tend to glaze over when he's talking.”

LAURA: Emon's gone, Kima.

TRAVIS: Yeah, basically four big fuck-off chromatic dragons destroyed Emon and then Westruun and– Allura was there, she was very upset.

MATT: “Is she all right? Is Allie all right?”

TALIESIN: She's fine.

TRAVIS: Yeah, Allie is fine.

LIAM: We just parted ways with her– (groans) I have such a headache.

TALIESIN: Two days ago.

MATT: “My home temple's in Westruun.”

TRAVIS: Oh.

LAURA: We should definitely go there. We need to look at the Cobalt Reserve as well. We need to meet up with Allura, though. She was– (sighs).

MATT: “All right, well. I'm with you. Wherever you need me.”

MARISHA: I just pass Vax my water canteen on the sly.

LIAM: And I very obviously chug the entire thing.

MATT: “A few of you started early. I'm jealous.”

MARISHA: Kima, it's been very hard since we last saw you.

MATT: “I can see it on your faces. You all look a bit harrowed.

TRAVIS: Hairy?

MATT: "You surprise me day after day, Grog.”

TRAVIS: Why, thank you. Don't have to hide it around me, it's okay.

MATT: “All right, where are we off to?”

LAURA: That's a good question.

MARISHA: Where are we going?

WILL: Cobalt Reserve, he said twice.

LAURA: Yes, but that's in Westruun.

SAM: It's been destroyed.

LAURA: Not necessarily, I mean yes, it's fucked up.

TRAVIS: We still need to go talk to Earthbearer Groon and see what kind of lesson was there.

MARISHA: I also really need to check out the Fire Ashari.

TALIESIN: Fire Ashari are on the way.

LIAM: Let's count out the things that we want to do. Not what we're going to choose, just what we have to do, and then we'll choose something. We've got the Cobalt Reserve, which may or may not be totally fucked, right?

MARY: It could give us information about these dragons.

MARISHA: We need to go by there regardless. We need to stop by Westruun.

LIAM: Okay. So there's Osysa's mate.

LAURA: That's down by Westruun.

LIAM: Down by Westruun, in the mountains.

MARISHA: That's on the way.

LIAM: Yeah. We've got your people.

MARISHA: Also on the way out the door.

LAURA: It is?

MARISHA: It's not far from here.

MATT: It's roughly three days' travel, southwest of Vasselheim.

LAURA: But there's trees.

MARISHA: There are trees. I can also pop through a tree. I can pop through a tree through most places. Pop through a tree and get us to Westruun, as long as we take a nap.

LIAM: Three options. Are we forgetting anything?

LAURA: And Grog wants to talk to–

TRAVIS: Earthbearer Master Splinter.

MARISHA: Earthbreaker.

TALIESIN: While we charter a ship.

MARISHA: Percy really wants an airship. Dear gods, does he want an airship.

TALIESIN: What a perfect way to make our way quickly and efficiently.

LIAM: Let's just talk–

MARISHA: Quickly? Efficiently?

WILL: You can go through trees?

MARISHA: I can.

SAM: Only trees she's seen and knows very well.

TRAVIS: But the Earthbreaker is here.

MARISHA: Luckily, all places that we are going, we've been to.

LIAM: I mean, if we're spiraling out, right? Earthbreaker's here, Ashari are close by, and then we're talking about in and around Westruun.

LAURA: Yeah. So let's go to the Earthbreaker.

TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to the Earthbreaker.

TALIESIN: Followed by the Ashari.

SAM: Followed by the airship.

TALIESIN: Followed by the airship.

MATT: “Earthbreaker. As in Dawn Marshal? The great Dawn Marshal of–? (chuckles) I've only seen him from a distance. He's a rough-looking fella.”

TRAVIS: Yeah, right. He's got a pair of arms on him, doesn't he?

MATT: “I'm excited to see this.” Puts it over her shoulder and she's walking down, her little legs (clanging) with her armor down the stairs.

TRAVIS: Hold up, Kima. Hold up. What do you mean? Have you spoken with him before?

MATT: “I've seen him punch someone's head clear off.”

LAURA: Off of his body?

SAM: That is so cool.

WILL: You only turn them into paste.

LIAM: Level up.

TRAVIS: I'm excited.

MARY: Oh! Oh dear.

MATT: (laughs) “You're not the only one!” And she continues rushing ahead. You get the feeling that Kima's been locked up and been doing temple stuff for quite some time and is very happy to get out of her general duties.

LIAM: Lead the way, shitkicker!

MATT: You guys head back down the outside of the Heaven's Stair, making your way back to the outside of the Trial Forge. You can still see now it's middle of the afternoon, all the forges throughout the town are in full steam. You see big plumes of black smoke pouring out of the various steelworks.

MARISHA: On our way there, I pace next to Kash. So, do you– have you met Kima?

WILL: No.

MARISHA: I get the feeling that you guys knew each other.

WILL: No. Never met Kima in my life. She didn't seem to like me very much, which is odd, because everyone else seems to think I'm an amazing guy. Vax and Vex, everyone telling me they love my eyes, they love this– I don't know, it's weird. Bunch of your friends are just very weird.

MARISHA: You seem really put off by it. I didn't know it was so–

WILL: I'm not used to being around people all the time. I have one real friend, and that's Z. I'm only with her because she saved my life. I'd do anything for her. Everybody else is odd for me.

MARISHA: Yeah, I feel that.

WILL: There is one thing I wanted to say to you, though, about our kiss. I'm very happy that it happened. But I shouldn't have stolen it. And for that, I apologize.

MARISHA: You don't need to apologize. I also don't ever want to hurt anyone.

WILL: Of course.

MARISHA: Physically or emotionally.

WILL: Nor me.

MARISHA: Okay.

WILL: Well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.

(laughter)

MATT: So as you guys approach the outside steps leading up to the doors of the Trial Forge, you can see the large rust red-colored monument, Temple to Kord. Very rigid and very much a temple built to withstand. It's a fortress more than a temple. And you see above it still, across the lip at the very top at the front walkway, a little bit of the Kord statue, looking over the entirety of this section of Vasselheim.

TRAVIS: Oh boy.

MATT: The doors are actually ajar, they're open.

TRAVIS: Oh!

MATT: There are two Dawn Marshals there in their armor with the colors of Kord. As you approach, they step out of the way.

LAURA: Ooh.

TRAVIS: Yes, clearly my presence is recognized in this great hall. Good day, good day.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Wouldst thou care to follow me inside?

SAM: Let's do this.

LIAM: Verily, verily.

LAURA: Huzzah, I say, my Lord.

MARISHA: My liege.

MATT: As you walk in, the two Dawn Marshals that are out there put their arms together and they lower their head and bow. And as you enter, they close the doors behind you guys. The doors slam behind you and you feel the stone shift from the impact of the thud. 25-, 30-foot-tall doors that mark the front of this.

TRAVIS: It's all right. Pucker up, we're okay.

MATT: The echo of the stone slam down the long hall. You can see there are large pillars that mark the run to the central chamber. You've been here before, and as you walk across the smooth, very, very simple stonework ahead, you can see there is the central portion. It's almost like a giant cross, like both sides of the temple meet in the center. And there is a circular dip in the ground. Not really a pit, it's only about four feet down. But it's filled with a coarse sand, and as you guys walk up to that edge, each monk acknowledging you as you pass quietly, you can hear the gentle chanting in the distance of low, rumbling Gregorian voices, (chanting). And there, sitting in the center of this open circular sand patch, is the Earthbreaker himself. He is sitting there, legs crossed, arms resting at the edge of his knees, eyes closed. You can see, even from here for those who haven't seen him before, he wears simple free-flowing pants of a dark reddish color with a gold trim on the sides, but they're tattered towards the bottom. He has a one-shoulder wrap across the front there and these large prayer beads that hang around his neck. His skin is very dark and weathered by sun and training, and he is probably the most muscular human being you have seen for his proportional form, he is a human being built for discipline and physical martial training and battle. Older though, still you can see his long grey beard that rests about middle to his chest, the balding on the front a little bit, the rest of his grey hair rests to his mid-back, and he just sits there quietly in the center. The rest of the monks have gathered up and begun to form around the circle.

TRAVIS: How many monks, would you say?

MATT: Right now, about 15?

TRAVIS: One-five.

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: Are they talking at all or are they all super-quiet?

MATT: Super-quiet.

TRAVIS: I walk up to within 20 feet of Earthbreaker Groon.

MATT: Okay, so you leap down into the sandpit?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, so, you guys on the side. Grog, you leap off.

TRAVIS: How deep is it lowered?

MATT: You don't know how deep it is, but it's, it's not, it's hard sand, it's packed, so you just kind of–

TRAVIS: Yeah, but I meant the depression, is it like a couple feet?

MATT: Right, the depression's like an inch.

TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

MATT: Oh, you mean the depression into the actual ground?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: About four feet.

TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Yeah. So.

MATT: So you vault into it in a bound.

TRAVIS: Does he move at all?

MATT: No. He's still facing a little bit away from you in the far corner.

TRAVIS: I put my fist in my hand and I bow slightly. Does he move at all?

MATT: The silence is broken immediately by a low, rumbling voice that seems to have no particular source in the vicinity where you stand. It says, “You come because your lands now harbor a terrible conflagration. How do you think Groon can assist?” Still facing away from you.

TRAVIS: We have traveled near and far, great Grood.

MARISHA: It's like Sesame Street.

TRAVIS: And we would like to request upon you a moment of your time?

WILL: Why is he doing the talking? Why is he doing the talking?

MATT: As most of you noticed this time, his name is Groon.

(laughter)

MATT: At which point he stands up, and, you know, would only come to about your sternum, height-wise, but he's just this tense, every muscle is seemingly, there's not an ounce of fat on this body and–

TRAVIS: Like a protein shake.

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: Paleo.

MATT: Turns around towards you and says, “You stray from the darkness that I warned you, but this current distraction is too great. Even your blood is drawn to the flames of promise and power. This shall be a test to see if you will break against the shadow.”

SAM: What shall be a test?

LAURA: What's the test?

MATT: “I know many things, Grog Strongjaw.”

TRAVIS: He said my full name.

MATT: “But such knowledge is earned, not given.”

MARISHA: (whispers) Shit, you might have to fight this motherfucker.

MATT: “Where do you find your strength?”

LIAM: (whispers) What's he talking about, Grog?

MATT: As you're thinking, in a blinding instant you see a flash of movement and, like a dagger in your stomach, his elbow is (impact sound).

(groaning)

MATT: Moved three feet in an instant and has slammed you right in the center of your abdomen. The breath just escapes you as you fall back, unable to really catch yourself, and just land flat on your back in the sand.

TRAVIS: (wheezing sounds)

MARISHA: We're all hanging back.

MATT: Puts his arm down.

MARISHA: Just watching.

MATT: “Strongjaw. Where do you find your strength?”

TRAVIS: In my anger.

MATT: “You walk between worlds. Weakness in mind or weakness in conviction. What do you stand for? Where do you find your strength?” At which point, as you're getting up, there's another blinding flash for a second and your feet are left out from under you. Go ahead and make an athletics check, because you're now prepared for this one.

WILL: Jeez.

TALIESIN: Gonna get smackdown.

TRAVIS: 19.

MATT: Your feet go out from under you as you slam onto your back, you just barely caught your breath before it's almost knocked out again. He's looking down at you this time, once again, his eyes just white. “Choose. Choose the two here who would save you.”

TRAVIS: (whispers) Pike's not here.

MATT: “Who would push you to your potential. Choose your bloody muses.”

SAM: Does he mean us, or?

TRAVIS: Do they have to be here?

MATT: He looks over to the rest of you on the side of the pit. “Choose.”

TRAVIS: (sighs) I choose my buddy Pike.

SAM: She's not here.

TRAVIS: I don't care, I just say it anyway. I choose Vax and I choose Scanlan.

SAM: We give him his strength, sir.

MATT: As you finish that sentence, two monks that you failed to notice were behind you shove both of you into the pit. Make acrobatics checks, both of you guys.

SAM: (laughing nervously) Not my kind of fight! Oh, I got a ten.

LIAM: 34.

MATT: Okay.

(laughter)

MATT: You tumble, catch Grog's arm, and lift him onto his feet as you land yourself at his side. Scanlan is face-down in the sand.

SAM: Are we talking still?

LIAM: I would just like to point out that I am mostly sober.

MATT: Groon takes two steps back and just closes his eyes and puts his arms at his sides. “Now. Show me your conviction.”

MARISHA: Oh snap!

MATT: I need you three to roll initiative.

ALL: Oh!

LIAM: Natural 20! 25 off a natural 20!

WILL: Oh snap! Shit's getting real.

MATT: The statues that're set at the edge of this, we're gonna put you, Grog, there–

LAURA: Look at the coolness that's been created on this map!

MATT: And boom.

LAURA: So cool! This is awesome, Matt!

MARY: Look how little they are!

MATT: I'll just move it this way a little bit, just so you guys can see, there we go.

LIAM: I'm peeing just a little bit.

MARY: Oh my goodness.

LAURA: Hey you guys, don't die!

MATT: All right, so. Let me get Groon's sheet out here.

SAM: Is it just us against one person?

TRAVIS: Yep.

LAURA: He's really strong.

MARISHA: He's gonna kick your guys's asses.

WILL: Can you see, do you want to switch seats so you can see? Okay.

SAM: No, I can see on the screen.

MATT: Okay, so. 25 to 20?

LIAM: 25 off a natural 20.

MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

TRAVIS: 19.

SAM: 16.

MATT: 16, Scanlan. All right, perfect. First up's first. You, Vax. Just standing with his arm up.

LIAM: Click my Boots of Haste.

(laughter)

MARY: Click 'em hard!

LIAM: And use my bonus action to hide behind Grog's thigh and hold my turn.

MATT: Until what, what's your trigger?

LIAM: Until Grog moves towards the Earthbreaker.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: When he does it I'm gonna go with him and fight him if I can.

MATT: Well, your movement is in your turn, it's your action you have to hold.

LIAM: Oh boy. Oh boy.

MATT: So. Are you gonna wait behind him?

LIAM: Well, let me just think for ten seconds only.

MATT: Can't, you've got– dude.

LIAM: Yeah, okay, so, I use my bonus action to hide. Do I need to roll for that?

MATT: Yes, you do.

LIAM: Yeah. That's a–

LAURA: Ohh.

LIAM: No, that's fine, because remember, I'm me. So that is, that's a 25.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: I guess behind Grog.

MATT: He has no idea where you are.

LIAM: No, I'm going to throw fucking daggers at this guy!

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: Because I'm first. Oh my god. I am. First is 24?

MATT: 24 hits.

LIAM: And then, so I used my bonus action to hide, which means I can do two, right? So the second is not that great.

TRAVIS: I don't know what you're so worried about.

LIAM: Using Luck. Better. Second is a 30.

MATT: Yeah, both hit.

LIAM: Okay, now. This is, I'm the first to attack, which means that it is– Ooh, it's a 19.

MATT: What's the range increment on this?

LIAM: I'm Sharpshooter, man.

MATT: Right, but what's the max range?

LIAM: 60.

MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

LIAM: Okay, so. I'm hidden behind Grog so it should be sneak attack, and I'm the first to go so it's a crit.

MATT: You're the first to go, it is a crit. It is not a sneak attack.

LIAM: It's not a sneak attack? Even though I used my bonus to hide behind Grog's big fat leg?

MATT: Where could you possibly be, Vax?

LIAM: He's huge! All right, okay.

MATT: Where could you have possibly hidden from his sight in the middle of this giant open sandy arena?

WILL: He's disappeared!

LIAM: I'm drunk and fighting in a pit!

MATT: It's okay. But it is double damage.

LIAM: All right, all right. So there is no sneak attack, but it is crit, right? Because I'm the first to attack?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Well no, it's surprise, not the first to attack. He is not surprised.

LIAM: He's not surprised.

MATT: No. It's not first, it's just surprised.

LIAM: Oh god. I'm drunk, tell me what's going on.

MATT: You hit him twice, roll damage.

MARISHA: I know, I'm so confused.

LIAM: One plus seven's eight, and then eight. Eight and eight.

LAURA: (laughs) That's almost as good as all those other things you did today.

MATT: The first one, he deflects with his hand and it cuts the arm and you can see the little slash of damage it dealt. The second one, he's gonna use his reaction to do deflect missiles.

MARISHA: That's cool. That's some Bruce Lee shit.

MATT: (laughs) Yeah. He reduces the damage entirely, spends one of his ki points, he catches the dagger and throws it right back at you.

LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna use Uncanny Dodge.

MATT: Not back at you, though. Because you're currently behind Grog.

SAM: Hi!

(laughter)

LAURA: Are you still face-down in the sand?

SAM: What's going on?

MATT: That's 18 to hit.

SAM: That hits.

MATT: Okay. So you take 12 points of piercing damage. As he chucks Vax's dagger back at you, it sinks into your shoulder suddenly before it vanishes and returns to your belt.

LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry.

SAM: All I've heard was “Scanlan.'”

(laughter)

SAM: “My buddy Scanlan.”

MARISHA: (laughs) That's true, that is all you heard.

MATT: All right. Now it is Groon's turn. Groon is going to rush up to the front of Grog– actually no, to the side here so you're both in combat, technically, and is going to make a flurry of blows attack using another one of his ki points. So that's gonna be four attacks, all against you, Grog.

TRAVIS: Okay.

MATT: So that's a 27, hits, I'm pretty sure. Cocked. 26.

TRAVIS: (laughing) 27 and 26?

MATT: 16?

TRAVIS: Oh, it misses!

(laughter)

MATT: And 28.

TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits too.

MARISHA: What the fuck is this guy's base? What?

WILL: This is when you want to be fighting Wil Wheaton.

(laughter)

MATT: Okay, you take–

TALIESIN: He's doing a lot of math.

MATT: 31 points of bludgeoning damage. And his kick just– whack!– right across the jaw. You haven't even raged yet, and the pain is intense, your vision goes white for a second. And go ahead and make a dex saving throw.

LAURA: Oh man!

TRAVIS: Seven.

MATT: As his fourth action, sweeps your feet out from under you and you are knocked prone on the ground.

MARISHA: Oh, shit. This guy's a badass.

LAURA: He gets four actions?

MARISHA: Monks, man.

MATT: That's his turn. Grog, you're up now.

WILL: And we can't do anything?

TALIESIN: Well, if you want to get involved.

TRAVIS: (panting) I. Would like. To rage. I'd like to stand up, please.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Do I have to roll for that?

MATT: No no no, you just use half your movement for that.

TRAVIS: I take out Craven Edge, and I'd like to swing twice against him.

MATT: Go for it.

TRAVIS: That's a 25?

MATT: 25 hits.

TRAVIS: 25 hits, that's good. And a 17.

MATT: Misses.

TRAVIS: Misses. 18. 21 points of damage.

MATT: 21 points of damage. All righty.

TRAVIS: And roll for the DC.

MATT: Yeah, he makes it.

TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

MATT: (laughs) Sorry. All right, so.

TRAVIS: Can I move, or is getting up my movement?

MATT: You can move, yeah.

TRAVIS: I want to move around, just stay right next to him, but move around behind him.

MATT: Right there, you mean?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Vax is there, then that would be your flanking potential there. Okay. Cool. That ends your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Did Grog moving activate Vax? Didn't you hold your turn or something?

LAURA: No, he didn't.

WILL: He chucked knives.

SAM: I'll stand up out of the sand. And I will, eeeee, I will–

(laughter)

SAM: I will look extremely weak and I will sing a song to him.

(laughter)

SAM: I will attempt to cast, with the horn, Eyebite on him, and I'll sing, (singing) My my my, eye bitten twice shy.

(laughter)

WILL: Wow. Best fight ever.

MATT: All righty, and that is Eyebite. All right, so it's a– you said wisdom save?

SAM: It's a wisdom save.

MATT: All right. What's the DC?

SAM: It's 19.

MATT: No, he fails it. So what are you doing?

SAM: This is a good question. I don't know what to do. Should I make him fall asleep? I think no. Because we want this fight to continue, that would sort of end it, won't it?

LAURA: Do whatever you want, I dunno.

WILL: That's a great look.

TALIESIN: Do something funny.

SAM: Yeah, I want him to go to sleep in the sand.

MATT: (laughs) Okay.

SAM: Just curl up in the fetal position.

MATT: Okay. Okay, what happens is, as soon as you move around, Grog, and you sing at him? He glances over at you for a second and his eyes roll back and he (impact sound) and just falls back in the sand, unconscious.

LIAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

MARY: Ladies and gentlemen.

SAM: That was a quick fight.

MATT: At which point, all the monks currently are gasping in immediate reaction.

(laughter)

MATT: As he's currently unconscious and affected by Eyebite. All right, do you want to move or are you staying where you are on your turn? Bonus action?

SAM: I mean, he can't swipe at me if I walk away, so I'm gonna get away from him. Although he can move super fast. I'll walk a little bit away.

TRAVIS: Now in the middle of the room.

SAM: And I'll inspire Grog, in case this fight continues, and I will sing–

MATT: Actually, you know what? No, go ahead. I forgot to read something. Go ahead. My own fault.

SAM: I will sing: (singing) Hail to the goliaths, hail victory, blood on the warpath, fight for Vax and me.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: That's the best.

MATT: Take your d10.

SAM: (whispers) That's the Redskins' fight song.

(yelling)

LIAM: That is amazing!

TALIESIN: Thank you, that was genius.

TRAVIS: I ain't using it.

(yelling)

MARY: As the worlds collide.

MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: Grog, Grog, Grog, do we really want to do this? He's down, he's asleep!

SAM: What do we do?

LIAM: Are we doing this, are we really doing this? He's asleep.

TRAVIS: What, like, so if we hit him, does he wake up?

SAM: He will, but you get, you'll get a few licks in.

LIAM: We're not trying to kill him, we want him to work with us.

TRAVIS: You fucking end him and you end him now.

SAM: Yeah, kill him.

LIAM: Excuse me? All right, so, I use disen– no, I don't have to.

SAM: No, he's asleep.

LIAM: Yeah, okay. So I got two daggers in my hands, and they spin around in my hand, and I just start beating him in the head.

MATT: All right, go for it.

SAM: I assume this is a sneak attack since he can't see it.

LIAM: Yes, it is, because Grog's right there.

SAM: He will wake up after this.

LIAM: 21.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but he might not hit him anyway, he rolls for it.

SAM: I don't know, actually.

MATT: As you go and attempt to strike him– You had advantage on the attacks, by the way, because he's on the ground.

LIAM: Oh, well then it is a 32.

MATT: Okay. Good. That hits.

LIAM: And then the second one is a 27 and the third one is a 17.

MATT: First two hit.

LIAM: First two hit, and the first one is sneak attack with the blunt edge.

MATT: Right. Which is doubled because he's unconscious.

LIAM: Yeah it is.

MATT: Melee attack within five feet.

LIAM: Oh, I'm so sorry! Nine. Plus– Whoa. That is ten, 16, 22, 23, 25, is 50? Plus the– 59. 59 for the first.

MATT: 59. Hoo.

LIAM: Ooh, that's the wrong one. And then the second dagger does ten.

MATT: Ten. So as you– whack!– hit him in the head, he immediately comes back to consciousness.

LIAM: And I'm gonna use my movement to run around and to roll around behind Grog's buttocks.

MATT: Okay. As you move aside, even on the ground, prone, he swings his leg out to try and catch you as you're running past.

LIAM: Acrobatics?

MATT: He has disadvantage on this anyway. That is still a 24 to hit.

LIAM: To hit? Oh, that's an attack. Even though he was unconscious?

MATT: Well, he woke up after you slammed him, second attack hits, and in reaction as he sees you rush off, he kicks his leg up and manages to catch you.

LIAM: Yeah, I'm feeling that.

MATT: It doesn't manage to trip you, but it does deal–

LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

MATT: So you deal half the damage on that. All right. So you take– What would be 12 points of damage, you take six points of bludgeoning damage.

LIAM: Ah, fucking ankle. Come on.

WILL: It was still uncanny.

MATT: It was quite uncanny. All right, that ends your turn?

LIAM: Yes.

MATT: All right. It's now his turn. All right, so.

LIAM: I'm so acrobatic.

TRAVIS: We're waiting to see if he's awake or not.

MATT: So yeah, until the spell ends, you can use your action every turn to try and give him another effect if you wanted to, Scanlan. So he still has Eyebite, but he's conscious.

SAM: Can I change the effect, or does it always have to be–

MATT: You can if you want to, when it comes to your next turn, but it has to be on your turn to use your action to do it. He gets up using half his movement. Which is fine. He's going to, as he looks over and you can see him glance to the side of Grog and see where you are, as the giant crack in the side of his head and the blood that's trickling down the side of his face, he just rushes around, still in melee with you so he doesn't get an attack of opportunity, and he's gonna go unarmed attacks on you for three. Natural 20. That's a 17.

LIAM: No.

MATT: With your haste, yeah, you get a bonus, so that's a miss. And that is a 25.

LIAM: That hits. Two of those hit.

MATT: All right. So the crit, 28 points of bludgeoning damage. And the last one is gonna be 14 points of bludgeoning damage. And he's going to use three ki points. As he comes around, elbows you to the side of the face, you just weren't expecting it and it cracks you and you feel like a tooth crack and the pain sears through your jaw and you're like, ugh! And then he brings his lower hand and (impact) hits you right in the center of the abdomen, and it hits you, and it hurts, but it's not as impactful as you thought it would be for the force, but you feel like this strange, like, quivering vibration in your midsection, like almost like the muscles are spasming uncontrollably and you don't quite understand why. That is going to end his turn. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: No! And I go into a frenzied rage. If it's gonna be an ass-beating we take, we might as well just get on with it. And I'll use reckless attack and Great Weapon Master against him.

MATT: Okay, go for it.

TRAVIS: Which means he gets advantage on everything against me, but fuck it, he's hitting anyway. Oh, 19, so close. 28.

MATT: 28 hits.

TRAVIS: 23?

MATT: 23 hits.

TRAVIS: 16.

MATT: Misses.

TRAVIS: Damn it. Those were high. Okay.

LAURA: You could've used your inspiration.

SAM: It's true.

TRAVIS: I'm not listening to any of you.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: 32 on the first one.

MATT: Nice.

WILL: That's hysterical. RG3 could've helped.

TRAVIS: Four, nine, 17, 27 on the second one, and the third one missed.

MATT: Third missed, all right. Succeeds on the first save with an 18– and a 19, yeah. Saves both hits from Craven Edge. As you slam the blade into him twice, he's trying to parry them, and he's catching the blade off to the side, but the strength is too strong and you end up jamming it into his forearm. As you pull away, the blood streaks out. Each hit, he's still focused on you, and he's not showing any pain, he's not grimacing. You're just seeing the wounds being had and he's just still intent on moving and his expression focused on you.

TRAVIS: He made both those checks okay?

MATT: Yeah. And at that moment he looks at you and says, “You carry such a dark weapon with you.” That's all he says. Is that the end of your turn?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: All right. Scanlan.

SAM: He's still eyebitten.

MATT: Correct, yes. Actually, let's see, he has to save at the end of his turn. Which, he rolled a one, so no.

SAM: All right. Instead of sleeping this time, I would like him to just get sick. Be sick. I want him to be sick now.

MARY: What kind of sick?

LAURA: Like, pukey or like the other one?

SAM: Oh, he has like diarrhea.

MARISHA: That's the worst.

LAURA: Oh man. That's so embarrassing.

MATT: All righty. Yeah. As you keep focusing, you can see his form shifts a little bit, and you swear you hear the cramping of someone's abdominals in the distance, like an unhappy digestive tract.

SAM: You didn't sleep well, did you? No?

LIAM: Like a tree cracking in the wind from this guy.

SAM: And I will turn to Vax this time and inspire him, and I will say, (singing) Kill that monk-y douchebag, white boy. Kill that monk-y douchebag right. Take out your daggers and kill that monk-y douchebag 'til he dies.

(laughter)

MATT: Take your d10 inspiration.

LIAM: Okay, got it, got it, got it.

MATT: All right, that brings us to the top. Is that the end of your turn, are you gonna move or anything else–

SAM: I'll move a little further away, it won't really help.

MATT: All right. You're up.

LIAM: He's still pressed up against Grog, right?

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: All right, I'm gonna use disengage and pivot around Grog, right, run all around the circle and get behind Scanlan.

SAM: Oh shit. I was trying to get away from him!

MATT: Like that?

LIAM: Yeah. And I'm gonna throw two daggers at him, yeah. The first one's, okay, natural 20! Wait, it's natural 20 on top of a sneak attack, what happens?

MATT: Yeah, you double the sneak-attack damage.

LIAM: You double the sneak-attack?

MATT: It's a critical hit, all the dice you roll for a critical hit you double.

TRAVIS: Picked you for a reason, add that shit up, man.

MATT: And then you add the ability modifier at the end. So yes.

LIAM: Let me take a moment.

(laughter)

MATT: Rogues, baby.

MARISHA: Get the blood back in your head.

LIAM: Okay, that's a nine. Okay. Think I want to savor this.

WILL: He looks giddy, he looks giddy, it's great.

LIAM: All right. So. Oh my god. (counting)

TRAVIS: It's so juicy, so savory.

LIAM: 23 doubled, quadrupled–

MATT: Not quadrupled. Doubled.

LIAM: 23. 28.

MATT: It's doubled, not quadrupled.

LIAM: Not quadrupled, oh! So sneak attack is not doubled, then on top– All right.

MARISHA: But that's what you said. That's not what you said!

MATT: It's not a surprise attack.

LIAM: So it doesn't stack.

MATT: No.

LIAM: Yeah, but he's, he's up against Grog. So I get–

MATT: Which is meaning you get sneak attack. So you're doing sneak-attack damage on him, you critically hit, so you just double your sneak attack damage.

SAM: Just take your 80 points of damage, not your 160 points.

LIAM: So I double sneak-attack damage.

MATT: Yeah. You said quadruple, it's not quadruple, it's just times two.

LIAM: 23, the sneak-attack damage is–

LAURA: That's 28. Times two.

LIAM: 56. All right. Yeah.

MARY: That's good, there's no disappointment there.

TALIESIN: And now you add your knife.

LIAM: 68.

MATT: Oh, total of 68? Gotcha.

LIAM: Critical hit on a sneak attack. Got it, got it, got it.

MATT: He is going to use a ki point to deflect missiles.

LIAM: I'm gonna use my last bit of Luck so that he has to roll again.

MATT: Okay. All right. It's not an attack roll on this yet, just so you're aware.

LIAM: Okay.

MATT: This is him just reducing the damage he takes from it.

LIAM: Oh, all right.

MATT: So that is a total of, he reduces the damage by 13, he still takes the impact, but he manages to slow the blade with his hands before it finds itself in his chest and he rips it out, you can see the spray of blood that hits in the sand across the front before the dagger disappears from his grip.

LIAM: And I duck behind Scanlan.

MATT: All right.

SAM: Don't hide behind me!

LIAM: Yeah, sure. It's, that was a four, ten.

MATT: Nope. This one–

LIAM: No, I rolled, I rolled a bunch of times. Didn't I roll a bunch of times? Okay, all right, well. She rolled a 20.

MATT: For nothing.

LIAM: I rolled a, oh that did fine. It's a 27.

MATT: Wait, so you did a total of 60-something damage on him from the one attack?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Yeah, got you, yes, the second one does–

LIAM: Second one is ten.

MATT: Yeah. So the second one attack hits. Go ahead and roll for it. Or roll for damage.

LIAM: Nine.

MATT: Nine, okay. Cool. Cool.

LIAM: I'm scared to death, which is why the math is so bad.

MATT: That's good. Well, as it comes back to Groon's turn, Groon, you can see the blood is just pouring out of the wound that you left, he takes one hand and just (impact sound) slams it really hard, and it just kind of, the impact sears the wound. Cauterizing it.

LIAM: Don't want to be fighting you.

MATT: Still looking at you. He puts his hand out and does this, and that quivering in your stomach you felt earlier begins to shake and the vibrations begin to spread through your entire body. I need you to make a constitution saving throw? Yeah.

SAM: You've got inspiration still.

LAURA: Does that work on saves?

LIAM: Plus inspiration.

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: It's a 23.

MATT: 23. That is a success. You manage to just stave it off as you can feel it about to tear your insides apart, and you just tense real fast and the vibrations slowly fade. No effect.

SAM: No effect!

MATT: Would've been 10d10 necrotic damage.

SAM: 10d10!

MARISHA: What happened, like a chestburster, like came out of him?

MATT: It's called Quivering Palm, it's a monk ability.

LIAM: It's Uma Thurman, it's fucking Kill Bill.

MARISHA and WILL: The five-point exploding palm technique.

MATT: He's going to use another ki point, a bonus action, as he goes into a defensive stance, a familiar one that you've seen before.

TRAVIS: Before I whooped somebody's ass.

MATT: Yeah. But into this fully defensive, looking about and keeping his eyes aware of the entirety of his surroundings. And is going to stay right there. That brings us to Grog.

TRAVIS: Piece of shit, I don't know what that stance is– I chop at him some more with Craven Edge! I don't know, can I do one Great Weapon Master and the other two just regular?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: Okay. I'm gonna do that.

MATT: Are you doing reckless attacks or not?

TRAVIS: Yeah, reckless.

MATT: Okay. His patient defense gives you disadvantage on all attacks– He just nullifies it, so you just have one roll per attack.

TRAVIS: 16?

MATT: Misses. Just knocks the blade out with his own hand, you hear it (impact) off to the side.

TRAVIS: 16.

MATT: This time he actually catches with the two sides of his hand and throws it back towards you.

SAM: You could be inspired, god damn it!

MARY: It's right there.

TRAVIS: I'm gonna use my other d10 that's not tainted, so not this one.

SAM: All you have to do is pledge allegiance to the Washington football team.

(laughter)

WILL: Wow.

TRAVIS: 27.

MATT: 27. He goes to try and catch it, but you change the direction of the blade at the last minute and find the side of his flesh, go ahead and roll damage.

TRAVIS: Okay. So 12. 19.

MATT: He does make his save on that.

TRAVIS: 29. Damn it, he does?

MATT: 29 damage.

TRAVIS: 29. All that.

MATT: He's got a decent constitution.

TRAVIS: Yeah, you think?

MATT: All right, so the third blade finally sinks in about two inches into his clavicle area and probably would snap the clavicle bone if he hadn't put his hands up and caught as much of the impact as he could, and then throws it back again and just kicks you away to get a little bit of distance.

TRAVIS: Shit, really? Little distance, or?

MATT: It's just like a foot, just away from being clenched up.

TRAVIS: Okay. Can I move opposite of where my two lads are so I stay behind him again?

MATT: Right there? Yeah, you can do that. Go for it. All right, that ends your turn?

TRAVIS: Yep.

MATT: Scanlan, you're up. Well, let me see actually if he resists the– Nope.

SAM: Still sick.

MATT: Actually, actually no, remembering this, because I kept forgetting to do it before, but that's fine, he's gonna use his legendary resistance to automatically succeed, so he no longer has Eyebite.

SAM: Oh, so he's done.

LAURA: He's not shitting himself anymore.

MARY: No. But the stench is great.

MATT: So sickness fades. He spent last round not doing any actual physical attacks for that reason.

SAM: All right. Well. I'm far away from him, but Grog's right next to him, so I probably shouldn't do anything too terrible.

TRAVIS: Do it! Do it!

LIAM: But he's a sponge!

TRAVIS: Do it! If you don't do it, he will, do it.

MARISHA: That's why we have Grog around.

SAM: I'll join in the bludgeon-fest, and I will cast (sings) Bigby's Hand! And I will, I'll make it come right next to him, sort of between him and Grog? I can't get between him and Grog.

MATT: There you go. Not between them, no, but you can put it like next to him or behind him.

SAM: Okay. To the side, to the side would be good. And just punch! Just a couple punches. Just throwing some punches.

TALIESIN: Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself.

MATT: Make a melee spell attack.

SAM: Melee spell attack.

MATT: Got it, melee spell attack.

SAM: What do I add?

MATT: You add your spell attack modifier, which should be on your spell page.

LIAM: On your same page, your spell page.

SAM: Spell attack bonus– Okay. 27.

MATT: 27, that's a hit. As the hand appears to his right, he's still focusing on Grog and glances over for a second and tries to do a deflection, technically he's still in his defense stance, though. So roll twice, because he does have disadvantage for attacks on him.

TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good.

SAM: That was a natural 20.

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: But the disadvantage, so the 27. Yes. Oh wait, now I roll for damage.

MATT: Yep.

SAM: With Bigby's Hand. I rarely do this.

TRAVIS: That's true, yeah.

MATT: 4d8 force damage.

SAM: 4d8.

LAURA: You need to do that more, that's pretty good.

LIAM: Come on, Scanbo.

SAM: I'll just roll this one four times, it's fine. 17?

MATT: 17 damage.

SAM: 4d8, right?

MATT: Yep. So as Bigby's Hand pulls back with a giant fist, the fingers cracking in an arcane echo, whack! Slams into his side, he holds himself strong and actually slides about seven inches in the sand from the impact. And you can see him shake off his arm from the hit. Yeah, that hurt.

SAM: Decent, decent. And I will inspire Grog again, with a little ditty, I will say, (singing) You're a psycho killer, with a bearded face, Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog Grog. Run r– That's fine.

MATT: All right, take your d10.

(laughter)

MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: I just drop to my knees so I can aim better and right over Scanlan's shoulder, dagger, dagger, dagger.

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: Okay, first one is a one. So that misses. Second one is a 23.

MATT: 23. You're rolling disadvantage on all these, right?

LIAM: Disadvantage? For what?

MATT: For all these attacks, because he's still in his patient defense stance.

LIAM: Oh shite.

MATT: So what was this roll you just got–

LIAM: Well, the first one was a one and a–

MATT: Yeah, first one missed. The second one was a 23 and what did you roll?

LIAM: I don't remember what it was. Sorry.

MATT: Roll again, it's fine.

LIAM: All right, so this is the second attack. That is a 17.

MATT: Misses.

LIAM: Third attack is a 21.

MATT: 21 misses.

(groaning)

MATT: So all three daggers come at him and he just dodges one right off the head, another one he parries out of the way, and the third one he does a crescent kick– whack!– and knocks the dagger out of the air that spins off to the side before it returns to your belt.

LIAM: And just under my breath I say, “So fucking cool.”

(laughter)

MATT: At the end of your turn before it's his turn he's gonna go ahead and use one action point to use Like the Wind, where he moves his speed without taking attacks of opportunity. He turns and rushes up to Scanlan.

SAM: I'm a little boy!

MATT: Starting his turn, now, he's gonna come for you, Scanlan, he's gonna go ahead and do a flurry of blows against you.

LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan!

MATT: So. Scanlan. First attack is 29.

SAM: Yeah.

MATT: Natural one, fails on the second one.

SAM: Okay, I'll use Cutting Words on the last one.

MATT: Okay, well the third one is a 20. And the fourth one is a 31.

TRAVIS: Jesus.

MATT: So three hits.

SAM: But I'm using Cutting Words on the third one to try to–

LIAM: You said the last one.

SAM: No, I said the third one.

MARISHA: It doesn't matter, they all suck.

MATT: Whichever one you want. So the first one hits, Cutting Words to reduce the attack on the–

SAM: On the one that was a 20.

MATT: Yeah. So go ahead and roll your d10.

SAM: Okay. Six.

MATT: Six. What's your AC?

SAM: 17.

MATT: Yeah, no, so you manage to, what do you shout at him as he's doing these punches against you?

SAM: I sing, (singing) No no no no, don't phunk with my heart!

(laughter)

MATT: He cocks his head like a confused puppy for a second and the fist just hits air above your head.

TRAVIS: You've gotta be kidding me, man.

MATT: However, you do take 14 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike, and another 14 points of bludgeoning damage, so a total of 28 points of bludgeoning damage from two hits. Go ahead and make a dex saving throw, if you could.

SAM: Dex, dex, dex.

TALIESIN: Four.

SAM: 16. Oh, plus four? Really? Okay. Oh, yeah. Saw that for some reason there's a plus four there. 20.

MATT: 20's what you need. His last hit, he's trying to kick you square in the chest and knock you off your feet, and while it hits you, it actually forces you back into Vax, and Vax holds you up and you manage to keep on your feet.

LIAM: Whoa, buddy.

SAM: Oh, hi. I'm between two strong men.

LIAM: Debatable.

SAM: I'm lucky Pierre.

MATT: Or no, it's Grog's turn, it's Grog's turn, because you just took yours, yeah.

TRAVIS: It's my turn? Yeah, I just keep swinging away.

MATT: So you're gonna move up to him?

TRAVIS: Yes, please.

MATT: Oh, and as a note, I need you to make a concentration check for both of those hits, they were 14 damage each, so, and you have Warcaster, right?

SAM: Oh, yes. Oh yes.

MATT: So go ahead and make constitution checks. Constitution. Let me look at this.

SAM: That's 11 plus two is 13, right? Not great, not great. And 14. 13 and 14.

MATT: Okay, yeah, that's gonna end concentration, Bigby's Hand off the table.

SAM: (gasps) Bigby's Hand is gone.

MATT: Too much damage for you on that one. So from the impact of the blows you just managed, the spell fizzles from your mind and the hand dissipates into the distance. All right, now, Grog.

TRAVIS: At the end of his turn, did he go back into his defensive pose?

MATT: No.

TRAVIS: Okay, great. Okay, so, reckless attack. That's, let's make it Great Weapon Master with the inspiration. 24.

MATT: 24 hits.

TRAVIS: Thank you.

MATT: You've gotta say Great Weapon Master before you roll, by the way.

TRAVIS: Should I do it for the next one, then?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: Okay. So that one didn't.

MATT: Because it can't be like, oh, that doesn't hit, I'm not gonna do Great Weapon Master yet, you have to get the penalty before you roll.

TRAVIS: Right, that makes sense. Right. So it was a 29, no, I mean it wasn't. What?

MATT: You said it was a 24, for that one it would've been a twenty— it hit regardless.

TRAVIS: Okay. Hit regardless.

MATT: So yeah. So the first one was just a regular hit.

TRAVIS: So we'll do the third one will be Great Weapon Master. This is disadvantage. Come on, where are the damn crits? 20.

MATT: 20 misses.

TRAVIS: Yep, okay, this is Great Weapon Master. With adva– with the inspiraton.

MATT: Yeah. So.

TRAVIS: 28? No, minus five. 23.

MATT: 23 just hits.

(cheering)

MATT: So a regular hit, and then a Great Weapon Master hit.

TRAVIS: Okay. Six, 11, 19 is the first one.

MATT: 19 damage, all right.

TRAVIS: Fuck. Nine, 17, 27.

MATT: 27, got it. Both of the strikes, makes his save, makes his save.

TRAVIS: (sputters) Not once?

MATT: It's a 12 DC, it's not a very hard DC for–

TRAVIS: Yeah, but he's gotta roll shitty sometimes.

MATT: He probably will eventually. So anyway. As you're striking the blades at him, the pain, he's just taking the pain to his back, now, because he's facing Scanlan, and both times hack into the back of his shoulderblades and the exposed muscle you can see as the blade draws back you can see the muscle and the blood arcing after each draw of the weapon. However, he glances over his shoulder at you as you finish your second blow and at the end of your turn he's gonna use two action points to use Whirlwind of Blows–

TRAVIS: Can I move? Oh, I already moved.

MATT: You already moved, yeah. I mean, you can keep moving if you wanted to move away.

TRAVIS: I wanted to move in between him and Scanlan, just wrap around.

MATT: You can't move between, but you can get there if you want.

TRAVIS: Okay, that'd be good.

MATT: Okay. So he's gonna get an attack on everyone within range of his punches, which would be you and Scanlan. That is gonna be a 26 against you.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: And a natural 20 against Scanlan.

SAM: That doesn't hit. That doesn't hit.

(laughter)

MATT: First to you, Grog, that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage. Halved to nine. And Scanlan, that is six, no, sorry– 24 points of bludgeoning damage.

SAM: Ah, that's not bad. I'll be fine.

MATT: All right. Now it's Scanlan's turn.

SAM: Oh, shit, I get to do more shit?

TRAVIS: Where you at?

SAM: I'm fine.

TALIESIN: Looking a little rough.

SAM: Fine. Monk's got nothing on me.

MATT: So last turn you missed all three on him, remember?

LIAM: Oh, thanks.

SAM: So he's right next to me, he's right next to all of us. Okay. Well, I will– he's right next to me?

MATT: Yep.

SAM: And no one's behind him. So I will just Lightning Bolt him. From right there. Can I do that?

MATT: You can, yeah. So as you're there in front, you just reach back–

SAM: Oh, I've got something in my pocket, (yells).

(laughter)

MATT: All right.

TALIESIN: You let the lightning out of the bottle.

MATT: What's the DC? I imagine this was out of your–

SAM: Is this my spell DC? So 19.

MATT: 19 with the hand cone, so you were like, hup, yaaaa!

SAM: Yeah, yeah.

MATT: 19.

TALIESIN: Need some d6's, man?

MATT: He's going to use another of his legendary resistances to make the save. And he has evasion, which means dex save for half, he gets no damage on his success, so as you do Lightning Bolt, he literally just goes into the splits as the bolt streaks over his head.

LIAM: He Van Damme'd it!

MATT: Slams one of the nearby pillars, and as you realize that, you look down at him as he squeezes his legs back together and lands right back on his feet.

WILL: Oh, god. He took no Van Damme-age.

(laughter)

SAM: He's fast as lightning. Damn it.

MATT: Is that your turn?

SAM: I mean, that's all I can do. You know what, I'll use my bonus action to heal myself a bit.

MATT: Okay, go for it.

SAM: I'll use Healing Word on myself at third level. So that's two, 3d4 plus five, right? Ten, ten plus five. Ten plus five. Okay, 15. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, I'll take that.

MATT: Sure, go for it. All right, that ends your turn, Vax, you're up.

LIAM: You might already know this, but I'm wearing my Cloak of Displacement, so he should be at disadvantage to hit me.

MATT: Good to know going forward.

LIAM: Yeah, thanks. I want to use one action to grab Scanlan by his purple shirt and rip him and pull him away.

MATT: That's gonna be your action.

LIAM: Sure.

MATT: So you won't have any attacks this round.

LIAM: With Boots of Haste on?

MATT: In order to get the additional, well, actually no, you would get one attack from the haste. You would. Your offhand attack you don't get unless you're doing an attack action, so you get one attack.

LIAM: That's fine, that's fine, I rip him, I yank him away and throw the little bugger.

SAM: As I fly through the air, I'm looking up to see if Kashaw's putting any moves on Keyleth or anything.

WILL: Great fight, man!

MARISHA: (screaming)

WILL: Great fight!

MARISHA: Oh god!

LIAM: And then throw a dagger past Grog at him. For– not that great. 19.

MATT: 19?

LIAM: 19, that's it.

MATT: Misses, yeah.

LIAM: Okay, so I threw him, I threw a dagger and missed, and I just juke to the right and get behind Grog.

MATT: Okay. So move there. At the end of your turn, he's gonna use his last action point to do an unarmed attack against Grog. That's gonna be a 21?

TRAVIS: Pretty sure.

MATT: It hits? Okay.

MARISHA: Yeah, pretty sure.

MATT: You take ten points of bludgeoning damage.

TRAVIS: Halved to five.

MATT: Half. He's gonna use another ki point to, I need you to make a constitution save.

TRAVIS: Okay. 17.

MATT: 17. As he turns back and slams his fist right in the center of your clavicle, you feel a crack in the sternum and your whole body, all your muscles just seize up and you are currently stunned from a stunning strike until the end of his next turn.

LIAM: We got this, guys.

MATT: However, it's now his next turn.

LAURA: Oh no.

MATT: But you're still stunned. He is now going to, since you don't have a threat to him, he's going to swing around, jump between the two of them, and he's gonna do a flurry of blows, two punches against each of you. Against Scanlan, that's a 17?

SAM: That's my armor class, 17.

MATT: That hits, okay. Second one is a 17 again.

SAM: Can I use my Cutting Words on that one?

MATT: Do you have any more uses of your bardic inspiration?

SAM: It's once per turn.

MATT: You have a limited number of bardic inspirations per short rest that you can use, and you've used quite a few this battle.

SAM: Oh, that's considered a bardic inspiration, my Cutting Words?

MATT: Yeah, you use one of those dice to reduce the damage. You've inspired at least–

LIAM: Me once, Grog once–

MATT: Grog twice now.

SAM: It says, bardic inspiration, no that's not it, is it? 1d10, is that, five?

TALIESIN: Five, you have five of those.

MATT: So this would be your last one.

SAM: Okay, I'm using it.

MATT: All right, go for it.

SAM: It's a d10, yeah?

TALIESIN: Yeah. Although to be fair, it doesn't matter what you roll.

MATT: It doesn't matter what you roll, you're still.

SAM: Hey, I rolled a six.

MATT: Okay, so one of the attacks, as he's coming for you, he hits you once, and as he rears back for another kick to the side of your head, you shout–

SAM: Don't hit me, I'm a little boy!

(laughter)

MATT: Just enough pause for you to duck out of the way. However, he uses that inertia to spin back on Vax for a 27.

LIAM: Uncanny Dodge.

MATT: And a 21.

LIAM: That hits.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: So first one Uncanny Dodge, second one full brunt.

MATT: So Scanlan, you take nine points of bludgeoning damage.

SAM: Not bad.

MATT: Vex, you take, ah–

LIAM: I'm Vax.

MATT: Sorry, Vax. Every now and then.

LIAM: Every time.

MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half.

LIAM: Seven. Yeah.

MATT: And the other one is nine points.

LIAM: Nine points.

MATT: Yep.

LIAM: Okay.

MATT: So a total of 16 points of damage. He's going to use a ki point again, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

LIAM: Okay. It's gonna be great. 14.

MATT: 14. Towards the end of his turn, Grog's stun shifts off of him, you feel your muscles tense up and you almost fall to your knees as your whole body seizes, the muscles just lock in place. All righty. Grog, it's your turn.

TRAVIS: I'm gonna take Craven Edge and I'm gonna stab him into the sand. And I'm gonna take out the Firebrand Warhammer instead.

MATT: Okay. So you drop the weapon for free, you pull out the fire hammer and it bursts into flame in your hands as you wield it. As you drop Craven Edge, you hear this voice scream in the back of your head, “You fool! This fight is ours!” As the hammer lights up, you just feel this cold dread run down your spine. I need you to make a will saving throw. A wisdom saving throw.

TRAVIS: Ten?

MATT: Ten? You can't possibly let that blade go away, and you drop the hammer and pick up Craven Edge once more. This is the true weapon of a warrior.

TRAVIS: You're right, it is.

(laughter)

MATT: And you are not gonna relinquish it. There is no way you could let go of this blade.

TRAVIS: No way at all. Reckless attack on all three swings.

MATT: Okay. The process of picking it up, we'll say would take away your bonus action. So you get two attacks.

TRAVIS: 14. That sucks. That's better. 27.

MATT: Second one hits.

TRAVIS: Okay. Ow. Six, 11, 19.

MATT: 19, all righty. This time as the hammer falls to the ground the flames go out and Craven Edge streaks again, no, makes his saving throw. As it hits him, he stops for a second, puts his hands together. I need you to make another wisdom saving throw.

(dramatic music cue)

WILL: Ooh, we're Star Trek fighting.

TRAVIS: 11.

MATT: Your vision goes dark as all the sight around you goes to black and the entire vicinity of this fades except for the Earthbreaker before you, just staring at you in this darkness. Then he steps towards you, one step, second step, and while his mouth doesn't move, you can hear his voice piercing into your head that just says, “Grog. You are stronger than this thing that binds you. Where do you find your strength?”

TRAVIS: In my friends.

MATT: The darkness around you immediately shatters and you can see now your friends off to the side, keeping their weapons ready. The entirety of Groon's posture has dropped, and he just bows before you.

(cheering)

MARY: Yes! Yes!

WILL: Wow.

MATT: At this point, he takes a moment and closes his eyes, and you can see there's this inner glow in his chest, and a bunch of his wounds heal up in but an instant. And as those wounds leave these scars, he looks across the body. “I will wear these with pride.”

SAM: (strained) So will I.

(laughter)

SAM: Oh, fuck. Zahra! Did you see how awesome that was? I was really good.

MARY: That was wonder– you still have a little sand right there.

MATT: At this point, he, Groon's not even looking at you guys, still looking at Grog, he goes, “You need not the strength of Vasselheim to aid you, nor is that strength any we have to give. What you need can be found, recovered, reborn. I can see in your face the path is already lying before you. I know of two. The rest you must find yourself. A gift from Kord himself to this mortal plane, carved from the corpse of the earth primordial titan that fell on this continent in the first war. These Titanstone Knuckles were a symbol of power and leadership for generations here in Vasselheim until the last known keeper was slain 200 years ago, the gauntlets taken. I know not of their whereabouts. The other, leathers adorned by the champion of the Raven Queen. This champion's tomb has since come to ruin, sunken beneath a lake to the west of here known as the Marrowglade Loch. Within that tomb lies the Deathwalker's Ward. Now go. You've found your strength. You know your path. I can help you no further.” He turns around, walks back to the center of the sand, and just sits back down in the same pose and position he was in when you entered.

LAURA: He's so fucking cool.

TRAVIS: Scanlan. Vax.

SAM and LIAM: Yes.

TRAVIS: Do as I do.

LIAM: Yep.

TRAVIS: And I bow.

LIAM: (strained noise)

SAM: I bow as well.

TRAVIS: And I walk backwards, still facing him to the edge of the pit, and I hoist Vax up.

LIAM: (garbled yell)

TRAVIS: And I throw Scanlan up.

SAM: Oh fuck!

TRAVIS: Climb out.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: Keyleth runs over to Vax and just hugs him super fast and gives him a peck on the mouth.

LIAM: Gently!

MARISHA: And says, that was incredible. That was incredible.

SAM: I look over at Zahra.

MARY: That was pretty good, darling. We'll talk later. It really was. It was very good.

MARISHA: Are you okay? Do you need healing?

LIAM: I'm okay.

LAURA: (whispers) Heal him.

MARISHA: I give him another hug and give him a Cure Wounds, level three.

MATT: All right.

MARY: Does it also make you sober?

MATT: No.

LIAM: No.

MARY: Potions have nothing to do with clearing alcohol away?

LAURA: No.

MATT: There's a difference between the healing and flushing one's system.

LIAM: Wait, wait, (vomiting noises) I'm ready.

LAURA: We should leave.

TRAVIS: I don't know about you, but I think we got all the answers we needed.

MATT: Make a dexterity save, Keyleth.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: You've had this coming. You so had this coming.

MARISHA: I heal you for 12 points. I heal you 12, and then that's actually not bad. Dexterity save?

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: 20 total.

MATT: As you see his cheeks fill with bile and liquid of your previous venture at the bar, you instinctually, as the mighty speed and reaction of an air-based Ashari druid, dodge out of the way as he spatters the stonework on the outside of this–

MARISHA: I hold his hair back a little bit. His long black hair.

MATT: Two of the monks immediately rush forward with towels out of seemingly nowhere and start quickly cleaning it up while staring at you very, very angrily.

LAURA: Sorry, we'll leave.

LIAM: Come on, it was their loincloths, come on.

TRAVIS: Apologies, apologies. We should leave now.

MARISHA: I just look at them and I'm like, he got hit in the gut a few times.

LAURA: He did, actually.

MARISHA: We're like a mile high, the oxygen's thin here, it's tough.

LAURA: We should go.

MARISHA: All right, we should go.

LIAM: And as Keyleth helps me away, I say to Kord, it was an honor, thank you.

LAURA: Kord? Groon?

LIAM: Whatever his name is.

(laughter)

LAURA: Or to the god that is–

MATT: Hey, this is a place where I think either would work. All right. As you guys make your way outside of the Trial Forge, we'll go ahead and leave today's venture for now–

(yelling)

MATT: – we'll return next week, return next week to pick up this next venture and see where you guys go from there. So, well done, guys. And thank you Will and Mary for joining us.

(cheering)

MARY: Thank you for having us!

MATT: For a couple episodes, yeah.

LIAM: What a fun episode.

MATT: Yeah guys, well done everyone.

WILL: Thank you.

MARISHA: I saw someone on twitter say that this was like our Cheers episode, and I agree.

(laughter)

MARISHA: I agree with whoever said that.

MARY: Keyleth!

WILL: Vasselheim: where everybody knows your name.

MARY: Actually, it would be Grog. Grog walks in the room, everybody goes Grog!

LAURA: Hey, come see us in Portland.

MATT: Yeah, come see us in Portland, we'll be there tomorrow, getting there tomorrow but we'll be there for Saturday and Sunday, come see us, come, y'know, bring your stories, we'd love to meet you.

LAURA: Come say hi. It looks like the posters are gone, but there's still some signed ones left if you want.

MATT: This means we'll just have to put more up.

TRAVIS: Come by any time, we have a one-hour panel, we have a one-hour group signing, and we're at tables the rest of the time, so just come find us anytime during the day.

MARISHA: And if you can't make it to Portland, our panel will be on on Saturday on Wizard World's twitch.

MATT: Yes, it should be. All right, guys, we'll see you next week. Have a wonderful, wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet? 

Part I

MATT: Bring it in. So to catch everyone up what's going on, Vox Machina, our intrepid band of adventurers, after dealing with the horrible attacks by the dragon circle known as the Chroma Conclave, destroying cities all across Tal'Dorei, the party escaped, sent the refugees they could, as well as allies, back to Whitestone, seemingly not on the radar of this attacking front of dragons at the moment, and then made their way toward Vasselheim to find allies, Pike staying behind to help with the refugees at the moment. Upon going to Vasselheim, you managed to encounter a number of old friends from the Slayer's Take and enlist them for the time being to help you with the refugees and your current wanderings here in the city proper. At the same time, you encountered Lady Kima, who also has agreed to help with the events in Whitestone and this entire dragon attack towards the east, and you, after wandering the city for a bit, retrieving these allies, followed Grog into the Trial Forge, where you had a conversation with Earthbreaker Groon. And by conversation I mean a full-on drag-out sandpit battle to prove your worth to him, in which case you were given information about these things called the Vestiges of the Divergence, artifacts of great legendary power that existed from previous wars that had wiped out most of society multiple times. These Vestiges have been scattered around the world, many of them lost to the history books or passed down as symbols of power through various bloodlines or government positions, or stolen and haven't been seen for hundreds of years. You've found the location of two of them, one of which was the Titanstone Knuckles, and the other happened to be some sort of a leather, a Deathwalker's Leather that belonged to a champion of the Raven Queen. This exists in apparently the champion's tomb, which used to exist to the west of Vasselheim until it eventually sunk into the ground as the topography shifted over time and resides beneath a lake known as the Marrowglade Loch. So. That is where we left off, as you guys recovered from the encounter in the Trial Forge, and deciding on your plan going forward. Stepping from the tavern, having a few drinks, and discussing the merits of your current path, what would you like to do, friends?

TRAVIS: That fucking hurt!

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Old dude hit hard.

MARY: Well done, though.

TRAVIS: I mean, we found two of the vestibules of–

SAM: What did you find again? Brass knuckles of some sort?

TRAVIS: No, no, no. He mentioned, he mentioned Titanstone Knuckles.

LAURA: Do you know about those?

TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. It's a bit of a sensitive subject. (clears throat) I think my Uncle Kevdak has 'em.

ALL: What?

TRAVIS: Yeah. The leader of our wandering herd? He has two prize weapons that he pretty much used to use to beat me, like, near death.

MARY: Oh.

SAM: And now we have them?

ALL: No.

TRAVIS: No, we, he's still got them.

MARY: So where, do you have any idea where they might be wandering?

TRAVIS: Yeah, it's this thing, I lost the GPS tracker on them, so, no.

LAURA: You should use Waze.

(laughter)

MARY: Sometimes it gets there, well, 20 minutes here or there.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but he's real strong. And it's only one of two really powerful weapons he has, so hey, at least we know where one of them is.

MARY: How is your relationship with him now? Besides the fact that he used to beat the crap out of you when you were younger.

TRAVIS: Just peachy. Like.

MARY: Really?

TRAVIS: Really great, no, it's fucking terrible.

MARY: Oh. That's lovely.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MARISHA: All right, well, we know where one is. Where are these leathers, then? From the Raven Queen, we need to figure out where the Marrowglade Loch is?

MARY: The Marrowglade Loch.

MARISHA: Do we know where that is?

LAURA: It's a lake.

MARY: I did get a map from the Slayer's Take, is there anything on this map that would indicate where the Loch is?

MATT: Yeah, the Marrowglade Loch resides about a seven- to eight-hour journey swift of foot to the west-southwest area of Vasselheim. And it is marked on the map, it's not marked as a major place, it's just this sunken, somewhat muddy, swampish land. You've passed–

MARY: This wasn't the place that we passed on the way to go get Rimefang, was it? There was–

MATT: No, no no no. That was more north. But you passed this in your travels and some of your hunts with the Slayers' Take before, but it's never been a place of consequence, it is just a lake that exists on a map until this significance was given to it.

MARY: So we, so Kash and I have passed it before.

MATT: Yeah, I'd say probably some time in the past.

LAURA: So we know it's relatively close, we should probably head there.

WILL: If you think your uncle's closer than eight hours away–

MARISHA: No, he's on another continent.

WILL: Then he's probably not closer than eight hours away.

MARY: Or he's in the tavern down the street. You never know.

LAURA: I feel like we need to, we told–

TRAVIS: What?

LAURA: We keep changing places and nobody's going to know where we are. Pike is in Whitestone. How do we let her know we're moving? Or are we coming back here?

SAM: Wait, where are we going? Marrowway Cove? What?

MARY and LAURA: To the Loch.

TALIESIN: Well, we're only going for a day.

LIAM: That dragon's days are numbered.

MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like if Pike really needed to get a hold of us, she could.

TALIESIN: We could also leave word for where we're going.

LAURA: Let's leave word at the Slayer's Take that we're heading out. So if, you know, Allura or Pike shows up wanting to find us–

TALIESIN: Or, god forbid, if something happens to us, they know where to retrieve our bodies.

WILL: The Take's not coming out to retrieve our bodies.

MARY: No, they won't.

WILL: The Take's not coming out. There's no money in your bodies.

MATT: And Kima at this point looks about and says, “Well, if we have plans to head east and probably not spend much time here among Vasselheim for a while, I have some business I've got to clear up here as well.”

MARY: Can I introduce myself, Lady Kima? I don't think we've ever met before. Have we?

MATT: “This is true, actually. No.” And she steps up to you and you, you know, at first view you've had you see she's square-shouldered and pretty rough in the physicality of what you'd imagine from most halflings you see. She walks with her shoulders forward and she has this intensity to her step, even when it's just a friendly exchange. She bears armor that is gold with various silver and blue details on it that are parts of the presentation of Bahamut and the temple that is a representation of his worship. She carries a large, metallic hammer that she keeps left over one shoulder. She has just-past-her-shoulders wavy ashy, dirty-blondish hair and a big scar that rides across her face as well as a number of other scars that aren't quite as visible. She grins as she steps up and moves her hammer to the other side of her shoulders with a clink and puts her hand out.

MARY: I put mine out as well and say: your appearance fascinates me on so many levels, I look forward to getting to know you.

MATT: She pulls her hand away and she goes, “Interesting coming from you, definitely.”

MARY: Yeah.

MATT: “All right.”

WILL: I don't think we met either, how you doing?

MATT: “Anyway.”

MARY: That's Kash. A man of few words.

MATT: “I've met few as unremarkable as you in my travels.”

WILL: I'm sorry, I wasn't listening, what?

MATT: “Touché. Well, I'll get about my business here, you said you're traveling for half a day to a day, say meet back at the Slayer's Take in about 24, 36 hours, then head on to the east?”

LIAM: Are we assuming it's going to be as easy as all that?

LAURA: So, wait, a couple days and then we're heading out? I thought we were heading out now.

MATT: “Or meet up with you, I'm going by what you're telling me. We can meet up whenever you'd like.”

LAURA: Are you coming with us?

MATT: “I'm coming with you, yeah, but I have some business to take care of here in the city before we go ahead and head off.”

LAURA: Well. Can we wait a day?

LIAM: To have Kima with us, I think so, yes.

MATT: “Well, you guys are going– where?”

MARY: We were going to head to the Loch.

LAURA: To the Loch.

WILL: What do you have to do in Vasselheim first?

TRAVIS: Oh, good question.

MATT: She crosses her hands for a second and says, “Why are you so interested in my business, human?”

WILL: Well, because if you're coming with us, then we have to wait, so what you're deciding to do very much affects what we're doing. So let me ask it a different way: what business do you have in Vasselheim?

SAM: He just raised his voice a little, that was the difference.

TALIESIN: I didn't catch that.

MATT: “I was trying to arrange passage to the east. Got a little bit of pull here in the city, some favors that're owed to me, I figured maybe I could do a favor, but that's, I don't know. If you're going to have an attitude about it.”

WILL: Well then we're in trouble, I have an attitude about everything.

MARY: Pay him no mind, it's not personal. Kash.

WILL: What? I'm just, it's a logical question, see, she's got something to do in Vasselheim, we have to wait, what does she have to do? I don't feel like I'm talking out of turn.

MARY: Making friends as always.

MARISHA: To be fair, Kima and I had a rough start, too. She's, I mean, I love you, Kima, but I mean sometimes, you can get a little bit of, there's–

MATT: “Are we meeting back in a couple days or are we waiting, what's the business here, I–”

MARISHA: Yeah.

LIAM: How long do you need to get what you have done? You need a day?

MATT: “I'm assuming a day, I have to try and find a couple of folks and pull some strings.”

SAM: Do you need me to stay with you? To help you?

MATT: “No I'm fine. I've seen plenty of your strengths in the past.”

SAM: And nipples.

LAURA: Okay.

WILL: We're missing something, I don't understand.

LAURA: I feel like we're missing something, wait, you're trying to get us passage to the back–

MARY: You're trying to get us passage to the Knuckles place, is that, get them passage?

LAURA: Or are you trying to get us to the lake? I'm so confused. This is out of character, I literally don't have an idea what's going on.

TRAVIS: I want to insight check Kima.

(laughter)

LIAM: Little rusty after three weeks, folks.

MATT: “Part of you coming and asking for the aid of the palace was to help with this whole scourge of dragons you're talking about to the east. The ones that you say have destroyed most of Westruun and most of my friends still exist in that area. So I figure that's the passage we need to get over there.”

MARISHA: When you mean east, you mean like, far east.

MATT: “Eeeeast.”

MARISHA: Like really, okay. Well, no, there's time.

LAURA: Here's the thing. Also, our lady Keyleth, the beautiful princess that lives among us, she has a way she can travel us very very quickly through trees, so we don't actually need passage.

MATT: “Through trees.”

MARISHA: It's a new skill I've picked up since we hung out last.

MATT: “That's weird.”

TRAVIS: No, it's really quite painless. It's pretty cool.

MARISHA: It's, yeah, and it has a nice cedar scent when you go through.

LAURA: So unless we're getting supplies and we need to travel with a lot of things, then, you know, we don't actually need passage.

MARISHA: Also, I need to go by the Fire Ashari before we really head east-east, and they're west. So.

WILL: Yeah, there's like 37 things we have to do before, so.

LIAM: We need to carve out a plan, Kash is right, we should pick something short-term and do something because–

TALIESIN: Let's head to the Loch.

MARISHA: The Loch is on the way to the Fire Ashari anyway.

LAURA: Do you think that this is going to lead to some serious fighting? Because it sounds like these Vestiges are well-guarded.

TRAVIS: Well, you don't have any reason to think that. Could be hanging from a tree branch.

LAURA: I'm sure. You know what, Grog, that's an excellent point.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Just hiding in plain sight.

LAURA: Hanging on a tree branch under the lake.

TRAVIS: That's where I'd hide it.

MARISHA: Z, Kash, you all have been by the Loch before, would you know what–

WILL: It was pretty unremarkable last time we were there if it's the one I'm thinking of.

MARY: Actually, I may have remembered something about the Loch? What do I, would I have remembered anything at all?

MATT: Make a history check.

MARY: What do I do for that?

LAURA: Roll a 20 and add it to your history. So 11.

MARY: 11. Is that an eight?

MATT: It's a pretty unremarkable Loch.

MARY: It's a pretty unremarkable Loch.

MATT: As far as lakes go, it's maybe a few hundred feet across. It's more from a part of the land mass actually having a large sinkhole and where certain things may have existed, and there are bits of ruin throughout the surroundings of some sort of a structure that existed there, but most of it seems to have been swallowed up by the ground and the lake has formed in its place, though this was quite some time ago. And it swells or drains based on how much snowfall there has been in recent seasons, and it's been a pretty heavy winter for you guys, so you imagine from the times you've seen it that it's been pretty high, if not frozen over at times.

MARY: So it's rather unremarkable, but I think it's something that we can handle, definitely, within a 24-hour period.

LAURA: Well, we just loaded up on a bunch of potions. Some dickhead.

MARISHA: I am with Vex, though, I have a feeling that the chance that this item has been completely forgotten is not likely.

LIAM: Well, we need allies and we need power because we're not in shape to take care of a coven of dragons at the moment. Seems like slightly lower-hanging fruit than the other option?

MARISHA and LAURA: Let's try it.

SAM: What time of day is it right now?

MATT: At this time, it's probably, say, midafternoon.

LAURA: Well, we're not going to get there before dark, so maybe we should sleep here tonight and start out in the morning.

TRAVIS: Well, I have a question, and not like I can really help with this, but should we go see if we can read about some article of shadow-death, whatever the fuck it's called? Like, is it in a library?

LAURA: Maybe the Slayer's Take knows more about the lake, about these Vest– no, these are pretty secret, I think the Vestiges are a pretty well-kept secret, people aren't going to just know where they are.

TRAVIS: No? Like what if they're super-old but they go by a different name or something?

LAURA: I wonder if somebody knows about a cavern under the lake.

TALIESIN: That's what I would assume, is there must be some sort of underground structure, some part of the ruins.

LAURA: Or maybe we need to breathe under-fricking-water.

TRAVIS: Oh, I've got two vials of that shit.

MARISHA: Why don't we take the rest of the night to try and do some research. Is there any way we can find maybe maps or something about ancient history books?

MARY: And I do have a map from the Slayer's Take that I could–

MARISHA: Oh, no, but I mean, we need to find like books about civilizations that might've been here in the past that might get us some sort of– Like a library. Is there a library?

TRAVIS: Pictures or no pictures?

MARISHA: There might be some pictures.

TRAVIS: All right. I'm in.

LAURA: Is there a library nearby?

MATT: (laughs) Oh, it's been two weeks and I missed you guys.

WILL: Do we have a library at the Take?

MATT: Hm? There are a collection of books at the Take, but most of them are in reference to cataloging various creatures, details about their lifestyles, their inherent weaknesses, what elements of their bodies can be harvested and what clients are usually looking for. It's more specific to the business of the Slayer's Take than anything that would involve local history. I mean, I'll say if two of you would like to make an investigation check between the two, your choice, whoever wants to do that, we'll base, see what information you can find.

SAM: I feel good about my investigation, I have a keen eye.

LAURA: I've got a pretty decent investigation. You and me, brother.

SAM: Let's do this.

LAURA: All right. 23.

SAM: Not as good, but pretty good. 17.

MATT: 17. In taking the better part of the rest of the day and asking around, you manage to find one location that carries books, and what you would consider as sort of like a library, though nothing of the ancient historical fashion. There are many books about the history of the temples here in the town, elements of the battles of old, but they're all very vague in their writing as almost like a story as opposed to a historical fact-gathering-type presentation. You manage to find a place that does deal in dusty books, partially repaired and restored books, a little bit pricier, but there is one tome that seems to talk specifically about the history of the Raven Queen's rise here in the city, and if you would like to possibly take this book, for a price, that is up to you.

LAURA: Is somebody watching me at the moment?

SAM: Have I rejoined her?

MATT: No, you guys are doing this separately.

LAURA: Are we just perusing a bookstore, or–?

MATT: Essentially right now you are, it's a small place, but there are two employees, and it's not very busy at all, you're the only person in the room, so they're both just quietly watching from a distance.

LAURA: I sit down on the ground and start reading through the book.

SAM: Barnes and Noble-style?

LAURA: And see if I can find information.

MATT: Well, about 30 seconds into that, one of the employees comes up and goes, “Excuse me, miss–”

LAURA: Oh, hi!

MATT: “If you are going to–”

LAURA: I keep reading.

MATT: “I would ask if you would wish to read this to purchase it, as that is our business, we are not an open place to just utilize the information.”

LAURA: Oh, I thought this was a library!

MATT: “It's a book sale collection, please, if you're going to read it, please purchase the book. Or leave?”

LAURA: Of course, well, can I just check and make sure that it's actually got any information that I need? Because if it doesn't then I don't want to buy it. You understand.

MATT: “You may peruse for but a moment. If you do not find an essence of what you're seeking at that time, I would have to ask you to leave.”

LAURA: All right, of course, yes. Are you just going to stand there and watch me peruse then?

MATT: “Yes.”

LAURA: Well, I just start looking for what I need.

MATT: In the brief time that you have going through, you manage to glean, there is a chapter that speaks of the Divergence, it speaks of the last large struggle that happened in the center of civilization. This was the second battle before the gods themselves fully rescinded from the land itself. And the Raven Queen did have a number of chosen champions as a part of this endeavor, and that's as far as you get before he goes, “All right, so, you've had a bit of time.”

LAURA: I just don't know, I can't really tell if it actually has anything interesting.

MATT: There is a tag on the book that says 30 gold.

LAURA: What's the back? That's 30 gold! 30 gold. It's so dusty, though, I mean is that even worth it if it's this dusty? 30 gold? Does it have spells in it? No.

MATT: He reaches out and grabs the book and says, “If you are not a serious collector, I'm sorry, then it seems that we–”

LAURA: Oh. Oh.

MATT: And he starts pulling it, tugging it up.

LAURA: No! I hold onto it. Well, I know people that, you know, care about dirty old books, so I guess, I mean, I might be willing to purchase it for them, but they usually like things in mint condition when they buy their antiques. This has a damaged spine, I see it, and yellowing of the pages. And it seems like somebody's bookmarked this one.

SAM: It wasn't kept in its neoprene sleeve.

MATT: He slams the book shut as you're perusing through the pages. “30 gold, or I will ask you to leave.”

LAURA: Oh. This is the worst haggling ever.

SAM: Get out your buyer's guide.

LAURA: What's your name?

(groaning)

SAM: Just kill him!

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

LIAM: Oh, good grief.

LAURA: 18?

TALIESIN: We have robbed cadavers.

MATT: “As far as you're concerned right now, my name is No Sale.” And pulls the book back.

LAURA: I feel hurt, and I pull out 30 gold and I say, I suppose– (weakly) I'll buy it.

MATT: Takes the gold, hands you the tome.

LAURA: Damn it! It hurts! It hurts me in my soul.

MARISHA: That's the first time I've ever seen Vex pay full price for anything.

MARY: Is that the first time you've ever paid full price for anything?

LAURA: It is, actually. The first time.

MARY: Momentous occasion. Hunter's Mark that son of a bitch.

LAURA: I kind of respect you. I'm a little impressed.

MATT: “Benjamin Cole, should you find your way around here again and wish to pay full price for another one of our fine books.”

LAURA: Benjamin Cole. You're a dear.

MATT: “Come again,” he says begrudgingly as you exit the facility. So, looking through the book, it does talk about– specifically, there are a few champions. Many that were lost entirely to the battle, unrecovered. One of the highest of the Order of the Raven Queen, that fought in her name, was named Purvan–

LAURA: (cackles) Yeah, he was.

MARISHA: “Perv on?”

MATT: Purvan. P-U-R-V-A-N.

SAM: Last name Pedobear.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: We're running out of good names, aren't we? We've finally gotten to the end of your list of good names.

TRAVIS: (giggling) Purvan Pedobear?

MATT: Oh, you guys are cruising to a TPK today.

(laughter)

LAURA: Not on the anniversary, Matt! Not on the anniversary.

MATT: No, this is great.

TRAVIS: (giggling) Purvan Pedobear.

MARY: Kash and Z were left staring at the bodies.

MATT: (with great emphasis) Purvan–

LIAM: Yes, yes, get your perv on! Emphatically.

MATT: All right. That's more hit points onto these guys here, for later. All right.

MARY: Perv on, MacDuff. Perv on.

MATT: Purvan Suul is the full name, though the name was given to the Raven Queen at the time of signing itself to the order, in which they become nameless. The champions are just mentioned or spoken of in public as The Champion, so the name is part of the gift they give to the Raven Queen when they swear themselves to her. Fell in the final conflict and was interred within a tomb to the west of Vasselheim. It is said that it is a multi-leveled tomb, and as the Raven Queen's fellowship began to fall out of favor after the Divergence had happened– essentially, because her realm is death, during times of great conflict and strife, there is great power and a lot of energy given towards the Raven Queen. When things fall into peace time, or at least, for an extended period of time, there isn't a lot of conflict or burgeoning death and destruction within the vicinity, her worship tends to dwindle. As that dwindled, there wasn't enough people within the remaining bloodlines to maintain the tomb. It fell into disuse and since then has not been tended to.

TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody's there.

LAURA: There's definitely going to be ghosts there. Kashaw?

WILL: Yeah?

LAURA: Do your holy shit when we go there, all right?

WILL: I will absolutely do my holy shit. You don't want to see the god, but we'll do the rest of the holy shit. We'll be fine.

LAURA: Oh, really? Is it not, like, Sarenrae? Sarenrae? Is that your god?

WILL: No.

TRAVIS: No, he's married, remember?

LAURA: You're married to a god?! Wait, you're married and you–

MARISHA: Wait. We didn't have that conversation with her.

WILL: Yeah, we didn't. For the record, she married me, and there's a difference.

SAM: You're married?

WILL: Technically.

MARISHA: I don't know if that holds up in court, Vesh.

WILL: She's not really going to care about court so much as ripping the bones from your back. You really don't want to meet her. It's a bad thing. But yes! We can do a whole lot of stuff to get through the ghosts.

LAURA: Good times.

WILL: We'll just stay away from her. They weren't good times.

LAURA: I want to hear more about this.

WILL: You really don't. You won't sleep.

TRAVIS: So we also need maps, right? We need your maps.

MARY: Yes, I've got maps.

TRAVIS: Wait, don't you have something for me, also?

MARY: Yes, I do. Oh, yes! I do, actually. I forgot. I did keep it with me. As drunk as I was, I do remember telling you about the Moon Hammer. So I did. I brought it. And I give this to you, my friend. I'm very excited.

TRAVIS: How big is it? I know I'm looking at it, but what does it look like?

MATT: You go ahead and explain.

MARY: No, go right ahead.

MATT: It is a fine, smooth, dark metal warhammer that as the handle itself leads towards the heavy head portion of the hammer, the metal turns instead to almost a glistening ivory that has symbols pushed into it. A language you don't understand, but there's a giant moon crescent carved into each side of the hammer's head.

TRAVIS: Whoa.

MARY: It took me weeks to forge it.

TRAVIS: This is beautiful. Can I hit something with it?

MARY: Sure.

TRAVIS: What can I hit with it?

MARY: Scanlan, where are you?

TRAVIS: Scanlan, come here.

SAM: What's up? What do you need?

TRAVIS: Just stand right there.

SAM: Sure. Whatever you need.

TRAVIS: I reach back halfway and give a quarter-measure (whoomp). Right into Scanlan.

MATT: Make an attack roll. We'll say with disadvantage because you were taking a half-measure.

TRAVIS: About the same as the Firebrand-ish?

MATT: It's technically non-magical.

TRAVIS: Okay. 14.

MATT: 14. You manage to just barely, as you see this thing coming towards you, and duck beneath it.

SAM: I thought you were going to tell me a dirty joke, or something! When you say “come here,” usually that's what that means!

TRAVIS: No, I wanted to try out the hammer.

SAM: Oh. Well then, no! Try it on Vax.

LIAM: I'm already 20 paces away.

TRAVIS: Vax?

LIAM: I go stealth.

MATT: Roll stealth. Roll a perception check.

TRAVIS: Vax! Shit!

LIAM: 27.

TRAVIS: Two.

(laughter)

MATT: Try as you might to look around, Vax is nowhere to be seen.

LIAM: I literally just pivoted around my sister and pressed against her.

TRAVIS: Doing exactly what she does?

SAM: I'm going to use Minor Illusion to make a really shitty Vax. A really cruddy-looking Vax.

LAURA: Not in Vasselheim!

SAM: Oh, shit. Too late.

MATT: Too late. So as you're looking around, you see this strange quiver of shadow that seems to formulate in the air, and this awkward, still, unmoving, awkward mannequin-type visual recreation of Vax muddles itself there. I need you to roll an insight check.

MARY: (laughs) Please be low.

TRAVIS: It is. Four.

(laughter)

MATT: Finally! Vax cannot evade your vision this time, Grog.

TRAVIS: You stand right there. I swing down in an arc to try and hit Vax.

MATT: Okay. With this weird, awkward half-grin frozen in place. The hammer streaks down through this form and passes completely through it, slamming into the mud beneath, splattering mud up and around you, across your chest, and for a brief instant, Vax completely seems to have evaded the attack.

TRAVIS: (yelps) I killed him! He's all over me! His bits are all over me!

LAURA: Grog, how could you?! My brother!

TRAVIS: What did you give me?!

MARY: It's a hell of a hammer, isn't it?

MATT: With that, the illusion is dissipated and Vax is no longer there before you.

TRAVIS: (screams) (weakly) I've killed him. I've killed poor Vax.

MARY: Come here, darling.

TRAVIS: What is this evil monstrosity?

MARY: No. Come here. I lead him around the side of Vex.

LIAM: Hey, big guy.

TRAVIS: You're alive! Come here! And give him a big ol' squeeze. And I squeeze a little tighter to make sure he doesn't turn into mud. You turned into mud last time.

MATT: The harder he squeezes you, you fear you may turn into mud.

TRAVIS: Did it hurt? Did the Moon Hammer hurt you?

LIAM: No. No, I was able to dodge both ways apart, and then came back together. It's my cloak does that.

TRAVIS: Shit, this is like– we're going to save this for the really nasty fellas. All right, I'm going to put this in the bag.

MARY: All right.

TRAVIS: You know, if a kid or Scanlan or Pike sees it? She'll be so furious.

MARY: Yeah, she'll be terrified.

TRAVIS: I put it in the Bag of Holding.

MATT: All right. At this point, Kima has pulled a small flask out and takes a swig and goes, (sighs) “Ah, I've missed you.”

WILL: Can you give me a swig of that? Come on.

LAURA: Best friends forever. (gasps)

TRAVIS: (grunts, splutters) Respect.

WILL: Fair enough.

MATT: “So. Are we resting, or are we off? I'm growing impatient.”

TRAVIS and LAURA: We're off.

LAURA: We're going to go. We're going to camp overnight, yeah?

WILL: Sounds perfectly safe.

LAURA: You know what?

TALIESIN: It doesn't matter if it's going to be daylight if we're underground.

LAURA: That's true. All right. I just think, outside of Vasselheim, you know, things come out at night, but whatever.

WILL: We've killed a lot of them.

MARY: Yeah, we have.

LAURA: If you guys think this is the most brilliant decision, I'm on board.

TALIESIN: I'm actually hoping that it's the worst decision we make, because then everything's uphill.

LAURA: So much wisdom.

TALIESIN: Thank you. I'm just trying to bring–

TRAVIS: Let's do it. We're out.

MARY: Having passed the loch before, would we have an idea of what we might anticipate on the way?

MATT: There are all sorts of things that you could anticipate along the way. There are a number of denizens of this forest that are all sorts of levels of danger. There are roving orcish bands from the far, far northwest, which you encountered on your way to Rimefang. There are a number of other creatures that wander these areas: some of them bestial, some with some element of culture. There are bandits that come from the far west, possibly from across that sea that occasionally try and kill and pillage as best they can. Most everyone avoids the city of Vasselheim, because that place is pretty hardcore by comparison. So yeah, all kinds of things you could find.

MARY: Then I think we should go. We can handle it. Yeah, I'm ready.

LAURA: Keyleth, can't you turn us all to mist, and then we poof there?

MARISHA: I was going to say, do you want to Mist Walk this? It would be appropriate this time.

LAURA: Then we could be there before the evening.

TRAVIS: Can we control the direction that we move?

MARISHA: Yes.

LAURA: Can you Mist Walk us all, including Trinket?

LIAM: Context is everything.

TALIESIN: Better double-check that.

MARISHA: Let me see how many people I can do.

TRAVIS: How far away is it? Ish?

MATT: At a fast pace on foot, it would take you seven to eight hours.

MARY: I know a place where we can get horses, as well.

LAURA: Horses would die out there.

MARY: That's all right. They've died before. Might need food, as well.

MATT: You guys have a great history of–

SAM: Killing horses?

LIAM: I say we let Keyleth handle it. We swish out and camp for the night.

SAM: Let's go. Just do it.

MATT: Up to ten willing creatures for Wind Walk.

LAURA: Yay! Let's do it.

MATT: All right.

MARY and LAURA: (ghost noises)

MARY: We're like a giant fart.

MATT: For some of you, it's a familiar, if still uncomfortable, physical feeling as your body–

MARISHA: Just accept it.

WILL: What's happening?

MARISHA: Just accept it.

MATT: You become this amorphous, cloudy, vaporous form. You can fly at a very swift speed, even against a relatively strong wind.

LAURA: We probably should have talked out our plan before we did this.

MATT: Trinket in his mist form is seemingly very uncomfortable with this circumstance.

MARY: I use Beast Speech. Are you all right? Are you all right, Trinket? Everything okay? I can speak to him.

MATT: “What's happening?”

MARY: It's all right, darling. We're going to a loch. It's going to be great fishing for you.

MATT: “I will follow.”

LAURA: We can talk in mist form?

MATT: Sure.

(laughter)

MATT: At this point, I don't give a shit.

WILL: Your fun is wrong. Your fun is wrong!

MARY: Your fun is wrong.

TRAVIS: The t-shirt exists.

MARY: It does. Thanks.

MATT: I can imagine as part of the enchantment, as you guys can pass wind through your mist vocal cords.

MARY: Just about everything. He's very good at passing wind.

MATT: Oh, he's delightful.

TRAVIS: You really should just chain up with me and I'll get us there super quick.

MATT: All right, so you guys begin to head westward, following your previous experience at the direction that it takes you. You push that way. Kima is also still getting used to this whole mist form endeavor. It takes a little bit for you guys to adjust to this locomotion, but it is very swift in comparison to moving on foot. Drifting over the top of the forest canopies, you guys, riding the top in this full-on, Falcor fly-through moment as you're cruising through the snow-capped forest.

TRAVIS: Like E.T.

LAURA: That's awesome.

MATT: You can see a cluster of large eagles in the distance. You guys manage to swoop around. Eventually, as the sun begins to make its way towards the horizon– you managed to cut a good four or five hours off your journey on this, making your way towards the Marrowglade Loch. There are certain areas where the canopy itself breaks apart, and you can see ravines, you can see where areas of the topography have cracked or shifted in time, and there are drops that go deep under the earth, though you cannot quite see where they would continue to go, until you make your way to the Marrowglade, and there you can see, still full to the top, if a little icy at the surface, it seems relatively undisturbed. You make your way, all drifting down, back beneath the canopy of the Vesper Timberland, and at the edges of the lake.

MARY: Are there any islands in the loch? Are there any islands or any sort of rocks or outcroppings, or anything within the loch itself?

MATT: No, actually. It's a pretty solid surface, and as you guys have drifted down in your form, looking at it, you can see that there is a layer of ice. You're not quite sure how thick, but the surface is very crystalline.

TALIESIN: Any remnants of ruins around the loch?

MATT: Make a perception check.

LAURA: From above, could I see any sort of caverns or openings in the ground, or something that looked like caves? That's what I was keeping my eye out for as we went.

MATT: Make a perception check for you, as well.

TALIESIN: 25.

MATT: 25. You see there are bits of stone scattered about 30 feet out from the lake's edge. Going to inspect them, and looking about them, there are pieces of fallen walls and what appear to be elements of the tomb, possibly before it fell within, but you do not see any sort of opening or entrance. It's just a part of some structure, some foundation that was left behind.

WILL: Are there any runes or any markings of any kind?

MATT: Make an investigation check.

LAURA: 22 is what I rolled.

MATT: 22? Nothing near the loch. The largest chasm or portion of land that you saw that was broken and receded into the earth itself was probably about a half-mile to a mile back. Nothing that is in the immediate vicinity of this lake.

LAURA: Okay. Is this technically– are we in the woods? Is this my favored terrain again?

MATT: Yes. You guys have come down into the forest. You're all still in mist form, so you're unable to directly interact with anything in the area.

WILL: 11.

MATT: 11? Doesn't seem to have any specific elements or markings.

MARY: Can I try, as well, because I can read any writing that we find? May I make a check, as well?

MATT: Make an investigation check. Sure.

MARY: Oh, that's terrible. Never mind!

MATT: So, you guys all rest around the outskirts of this lake.

LAURA: How do we stop being like this?

MARISHA: Just think about it. Think about being a person again.

TRAVIS: How high are we?

MATT: As high as you want to be. Right now, everyone has come down to the edge of the lake, so you're right off the ground.

LAURA: Should we turn like people again?

MARISHA: Yeah, let's turn like people again.

LAURA: Tell Trinket to turn like a bear.

WILL: Why is everyone talking like this?

LAURA: Oh, can we talk normal? Oh.

MARY: Trinket, hon. Just concentrate on turning back into a bear, and you'll turn back into a bear.

MATT: “Okay.”

LAURA: Tell him I love him.

MARY: Oh! And Vex loves you.

MATT: (laughs) If a bear could grin, it would. However, the process is very strange as you see this misty cloud (poof) into a bear. It's about a minute for the full transformation. The spell still maintains its eight-hour time period, and you can transform back and forth during that eight-hour period.

LAURA: Killer.

MATT: So we'll say it's been about three to four hours, so you're about half-duration. All of you eventually take a minute to revert back to your physical forms, and you're all now standing at the edge of the lake.

LIAM: So for the next eight hours, with a little bit of concentration, we can jump back and forth?

MATT: Next four hours.

LIAM: Next four hours. We can spend a minute to go (foomf) and (foomf)?

MATT: Yep. You just can't do anything while you're in that form, other than move.

LIAM: Yes, I remember.

WILL: Can you move underwater?

LAURA: (gasps) Can we mist underwater? Can farts travel underwater?

MARISHA: I guess if we get trapped underwater, we could just concentrate and turn into bubbles.

LAURA: That's kind of cool.

MARISHA: Right? That would work, theoretically.

WILL: Or we'll all drown.

LAURA: Or we'll drown.

MARY: It's a freshwater loch, right?

TRAVIS: I don't know. I walk up to the edge of the loch and I look in the water. What does the water look like?

LAURA and LIAM: It's ice.

MATT: So your head goes (boosh). A little crack. (cracking noise)

TRAVIS: It's ice!

MATT: As he says that, you see a trickle of crimson streaking down the front of his head.

LAURA: Thank you, Grog.

TRAVIS: Welcome!

TALIESIN: I'm going to put some pressure on the ice with my foot. Is it giving, or is it not giving?

MATT: At the place where he put his head, or any other place?

TALIESIN: No, I'm walking. I'm just testing the ice.

MATT: Okay. Testing it with your foot on the edge, it doesn't seem to be any give. Looking up close, you can see it's probably a good inch and a half of ice.

LAURA: Can I go hit the place where Grog hit his head and see if I can crack a hole in the ice?

MATT: Yeah. It takes you a few minutes, but you manage to break apart and make a head-sized hole.

LIAM: And how thick is it, based on what she just did?

MATT: It's about an inch.

LIAM: Oh, just an inch. Ooh.

LAURA: This is going to suck! And I put my head underwater to see if I can look around.

MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

LAURA: Oh, shit!

MARY: It's good, though!

LAURA: Oh, with disadvantage. Doesn't it count as disadvantage by destroying the rest of my dice?

LIAM: Yeah!

LAURA: Perception. That is a 31? No, 41.

LIAM: No, 71.

MATT: You see through reality!

LAURA: Yeah, 31.

MATT: Giant floating baby right outside of the planet, in space.

LAURA: What?!

MATT: All right, so. Glancing through the murky water beneath the ice's surface, it is dark, and what little bit of light that would be hitting the surface is refracting through the ice, so it's very hard to get a form. You can see there's a very thick layer of bottom-of-the-lake undergrowth: various underwater plants that have caked the entire floor area of the lake. However, you can just see, at the edge of your vision before the rest of the light is swallowed by the water and the murkiness of the depths, you can see what looks to be the edge of some sort of stone structure, where two walls would be joined, but they break off and crumble and disappear into more of the undergrowth.

LAURA: (gasps, coughs) It's down there. Oh, it's so cold!

LIAM: I take her braid and I start wringing it out.

LAURA: My poor little feathers are like, poo.

MARY: Can I use my staff to cast Light and shove it down in to see if we can get any light out of it, beneath the ice?

MATT: Sure. You cast Light at the end of your staff. It glows and illuminates and as you shove it down, the light disperses beneath the ice.

TALIESIN: I'm going to take my mask and put it on, and use the glass to create a clear view into the water.

MARY: Should give you some light, Percy.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

MATT: Okay, so having to close one eye separately, as the light source is literally right in your face, you do look past, using the air trapped in the mask. A little bit of water is peeking in because it's not perfect. You do manage to see beyond that yes, there is indeed an element. It looks almost like a slightly tilted peak of some sort of structure that comes to a point, and the top of the point is broken off and crumbled, and there are a couple of sections of stone that seem to offshoot at four different points towards the very bottom of the lake itself.

LAURA: How deep does it look?

MATT: I'd say it's about 50 to 60 feet deep.

TALIESIN: 50 to 60 feet deep.

LAURA: Oh. Good, good.

TALIESIN: Give or take.

LIAM: Do you want to try to cloud-creep our way in there?

MARISHA: How far away is it under the ice?

TALIESIN: About 30 to 50 feet.

MARISHA: Let's stand over top of where it is.

LAURA: Is there any way– because I have this horrible feeling that we're going to get underwater, and then we won't be able to get out because it's covered in ice. Can we melt the ice? Can you do something?

MARISHA: I was about to do that, yeah, but I want to go over– Right above it.

TALIESIN: Oh, that's a perfect idea.

MARISHA: Yeah, so.

LAURA: Walk carefully.

TRAVIS: Are we all going in?

LAURA: I feel like we should.

SAM: This is the same day as the monk fight?

MATT: Yep.

LAURA: We didn't rest?! We're idiots.

TRAVIS: But we were going to camp when we got here, right?

MATT: It's about dusk now, if you guys are landing.

LAURA: Let's camp– oh, god.

MARY: So we're going to take a rest. What if I–

TALIESIN: We can at least start setting up in the meantime.

MARY: So if we rest, will it be a long rest? Overnight?

LIAM: Yeah, we're going to camp for the night. I don't think we should–

SAM: But our mist form will dissipate, so if we want to mist it, we should mist it now and check it out.

LAURA: I'm going to try to mist down and just see if I can.

LIAM: I'm going with her.

MARISHA: I have Water Breathing. We could do that, too.

MARY: Or we could Polymorph and do something.

LIAM: Well, let's just use the magic you already expended first.

MATT: You pull out your brand new hammer.

TRAVIS: Yeah, the Moon Hammer!

MATT: (doosh, doosh) Ice shards flying off, splashing in the water. You're covered in this ice-cold water now.

LAURA: I'm concentrating on making myself a fart.

MATT: Vex turns into a large, gaseous form.

LAURA: He's doing it, too.

MATT: Okay, the two twins, (foomf) together.

LIAM: Twin farts.

MARY: I'd also like to use Sculptor of Flesh and Polymorph myself into a very large alligator.

MATT: All right.

MARY: And go down and check it out.

MATT: All right. You guys, all three of you, descend into the open portion of the lake that Grog has broken through.

LAURA: Can we go in as gas?

LIAM: Can we breathe?

MATT: You guys do. It's a slog, and you can move slowly, but the speed that's normally granted to you by this– you actually move slower in this form underwater than you would normally, swimming, and as you submerge yourselves, you realize, even in this form, air is required, and you start (straining noises).

LAURA: I go back up.

MATT: The forms– it's almost like mist appearing on the edge of the lake that (fwoosh) forms up into your two different forms.

MARISHA: So pretty.

MATT: You, however, still delve down as your alligator, and you swim your way down across the bottom of the lake.

LIAM: Percy, we did some science! That didn't work.

TALIESIN: Congratulations. That's good to know.

MARISHA: All right, if we rest, I can learn Water Breathing.

LAURA: Oh, killer.

SAM: Our good old Zahra is already down there looking.

LAURA: Let's try to set up camp in the trees, so we're not on the ground.

TRAVIS: Yeah, like in Whitestone.

WILL: As they're setting up camp, Kash doesn't leave the side of the lake. He's just watching for where Z went in. He's just staring the whole time.

MATT: All right, so as you guys are setting up camp in a similar way that you did in Whitestone, up within the actual tree canopy itself, I need you to make an investigation check.

LAURA: Any sign of her, Kash?

WILL: Nothing yet.

MARY: Oh, natural 20.

(cheering)

LAURA: Oh! Natural 20.

MATT: As you check around the ruins, looking about, you can see there appears to be two different entrances that are both completely caved in. What you do see, though, is there's an area of the bottom of the lake, about ten feet away from one of the edges of the temple itself, that there is no undergrowth. There's the muddy floor, but it appears as if there is no actual plant life that has grown in this ten-foot-circle area.

MARY: Can I investigate that area?

MATT: It's mud.

MARY: It's just mud. All right. Can I get down with my fabulous snout and dig down into the mud a little bit?

MATT: Okay. You take your snout and dig through the mud and bring up some clouds of dirt and whatever scum has congealed at the bottom of this pond. It murks up the water around you. Your vision is obscured. Doesn't seem to be revealing anything, per se.

MARY: But I do see an entrance?

MATT: You see what would be an entrance to the structure, but the stonework itself has collapsed in on itself.

MARY: Can I see any writing? Any runes, any sign of carvings on the rocks at all?

MATT: Actually, no. It's pretty plain. The exterior is pretty damn plain in presentation. What minor bits of design or grooves that were put into the stone to give it a presentational bump have eroded over time, but beyond that, it seems surprisingly plain.

MARY: What the hell would cause no plant life? And I can do no more investigating than just that?

MATT: What else would you want to try and do?

MARY: (laughing) I don't know.

MATT: You are welcome to do whatever you want to do while you're here.

LAURA: Maybe Keyleth can find out something.

MARY: All right, then I'll go back up to the surface and report back what I saw.

MATT: All right.

WILL: Right when she gets out, he throws his cloak over her.

MARY: And I transform back into myself and whack him on the butt as a thanks.

LAURA: With your tail?

MARY: With my tail.

TALIESIN: That's what tails are for.

MATT: You guys return, and you relay what you found to the rest of the group as you guys are preparing yourselves. At this point, the sun has set, and the night itself is going from red to dark purple to a proper evening sky. Anything else you wish to prepare for the evening before you all find yourselves resting?

LIAM: Yeah. Sit on the ground. Your hair's a mess. I undo the braid and I just – starting over.

LAURA: (yelps)

LIAM: Hold still.

MATT: All right. Anyone else?

MARY: Can I go speak to Keyleth about what I saw?

MATT: Yeah.

MARY: Keyleth, I saw something strange down there. I told everyone before, but I just don't know what it is, and I'm not quite sure how to go about finding out what's inside there. There's no plant life whatsoever, and you have a connection, do you not, to plants, to trees? A much stronger one than I certainly do, I would imagine.

MARISHA: I do. I could attempt to see what happened. What do you mean, there was no plant life?

MARY: Well, I went down. There were two entrances, and obviously they had crumbled and were no longer accessible, and it seemed like there was one more, but around it– there was pretty substantial plant life all around, coming out from the ground, but in about a ten-foot area, there was nothing there. And I tried to get down in with my snout, but all I did was kick up more silt, and I couldn't really see anything.

MARISHA: Strange. This was at the bottom of the ocean floor?

MARY: Of the loch, yes.

LAURA and MARY: The loch.

MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if that sounds like anything familiar and could be a problem?

MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a nature check.

LAURA: Did it seem like a perfect circle, Zahra, or was it jaggedy?

MATT: It wasn't mathematically perfect, but it was noticeable to be a section of the lake floor that was glaring to be missing in a large patch.

LAURA: How soft was the ground when you dug into it? It was softer than the rest of the ground?

MATT: It was very soft.

MARY: I just stuck my snout in it, and it kicked up all the mud, and I couldn't see anything after that.

LAURA: Sounds to me like a creature that would burrow.

MARISHA: It's possible. 18.

MATT: 18? From what you understand, the reasons for something to not grow on the bottom of the lake would mean that the dirt and the surrounding earth would have to be disturbed enough to where nothing could take root.

WILL: It's a lair.

LAURA: Do I know of any creatures that are underwater–

MARISHA: That burrow? Giant worms?

LAURA: Is it like the worms that we encountered before?

MATT: From what you know and have researched about the worm you discovered previously, they tend to favor more rocky, mountainous terrain than underwater. There are many creatures that can burrow.

MARISHA: Are there any underwater serpents?

MATT: Plenty of underwater serpents. There's all sorts of manner of creatures in this world.

LAURA: It's possible it's a creature that's burrowing, or it's possible that's an opening into our underwater cavern, and nothing can grow there.

MARISHA: It could be a sinkhole. It could lead to–

WILL: Could be a chimney.

MARISHA: Unlikely, but it could be a chimney.

MARY: Working for the Slayer's Take, and having done research on the animals that we have destroyed for money, would there be anything that we would know about serpents, or another creature that might inhabit this loch?

MATT: Serpents in lakes? Nothing that would be monumental beyond actual water serpents, which are minor inconveniences and just natural creatures. Anything of this size, per se– there are all sorts of entities that it could be, but none that would be specific to a lake location, necessarily. Whether it be a subterranean creature that uses it for passage, or if there's something that lives in the lake, or is part of the lake, living in the water itself, nothing comes to mind, from your experience.

MARISHA: What time is it?

MATT: It's past sunset. It's now in proper night.

MARISHA: Let me go take a look, real quick.

LAURA: You're going underwater now? It's freezing cold!

TRAVIS: We're all going in there, anyway.

MARISHA: I can do my beast thing. I'll be fine. I jump in and go shark form.

LIAM: I go to the edge of the loch and watch.

WILL: So do I.

MATT: Okay, so the two of you are waiting at the edge of the loch? Keyleth jumps off the edge, and in midair, forms into this giant shark form that slams into the surface of the cold water through the opening that Grog had already opened.

LAURA: She's really attractive now, isn't she? That shark.

LIAM: I'm with Kash, man. What?

LAURA: Huh?

(laughter)

MATT: All right. Make an investigation check.

MARISHA: I can't do nature, or anything like that?

MATT: Are you inspecting the ruin? What do you want to do?

MARISHA: Can I see if the hole is natural-made, or man-made?

MATT: Investigation check.

MARISHA: Damn it.

MATT: There's a difference between your knowledge of nature vs. actually having to investigate a specific detail.

MARISHA: 14?

MATT: 14. If you're looking at the area that she was mentioning, where the plant life is missing, it doesn't appear to be man-made, by any means. It just looks to have formed by some perpetual disturbance of the muddy earth in that vicinity.

LAURA: Sounds like a creature.

MATT: Anything else you want to investigate while you're down there?

MARISHA: Does there appear to be any type of motion, or does it look like it's going downward, or is it just flat?

MATT: It has some variation to it, and there's a portion that appears to have been dug up, or at least, there is a slight indentation.

MARISHA: Let me do a quick lap around the ruins and see if I see anything that jumps out at me.

MATT: Okay. Make another investigation check about the ruins, specifically.

MARISHA: Oy. 11.

MATT: 11. Looking about, same details that she made out about it. You do see there is one other stone entrance of the partially tilted stone structure. Looks almost like there was a double doorway there, at one side of it, but a series of stones and a portion of the structure have crumbled in on it, and it has blocked the passage.

MARISHA: Does it look to be a similar downward suction thing going on like the other hole?

(laughter)

MATT: Looks like a partially collapsed, or completely collapsed entrance to this structure.

MARISHA: Okay.

WILL: “Downward suction thing.”

(laughter)

MARISHA: That's the scientific term.

MATT: CSI: Vasselheim.

(laughter)

MARISHA: I bounce out.

MATT: Okay. The shark (boosh) out of the water, catches you off for a second, almost Jaws-ride style.

MARISHA: Three point landing. Hi, guys.

LIAM: Fin, fin.

MARISHA: Yeah, fin, fin. Land shark.

MATT: There you go. Keyleth reverts to her normal form.

MARISHA: I'm with Zahra. Seems like something scary is probably burrowing down there. We'll probably just have to avoid it tomorrow.

MARY: There are no other entrances. That could be the entrance.

TALIESIN: We can unblock some of the blocked entrances. That's what we're going to have to do, is unblock the blocked entrance.

LIAM: It's going to be a big day tomorrow. We should probably get some sleep.

MARY: When I went around the ruins, did I notice how large the stones were that had fallen in for the blocked entrance?

MATT: They varied in size, because it was part of the wall that had fallen in on itself, so there are sections that are three, three and a half feet in diameter, and there are also a number of smaller, head-sized rocks and chunks that had all filled in this space. A lot of the general soot and mud that had gathered as part of the lake's creation had filled in and covered elements of it and seeped in to form this pucker-point, if you will.

LAURA: (laughs) Pucker point.

TALIESIN: It's getting weird tonight.

MARY: It's an anus of the loch. The loch has an anus.

LAURA: We should settle down to sleep.

LIAM: (Scottish accent) Oh, you're going to Loch Anus, are you?

MARY: (Scottish accent) I love Loch Anus! It's very muddy. Very muddy. Well, it is! I put my nose in it.

(all make sounds of dismay)

MARY: I did, as a crocodile.

MATT: Why are you making it weird?

(laughter)

LAURA: As we're settling down to sleep, I make sure that Trinket is laying between Kash and Keyleth, always.

MATT: All right.

MARISHA: I just snuggle up with Trinket. Hey, bud.

LAURA: Yeah. Trinket, keep Keyleth warm. She's cold. She was in the water.

MATT: All right.

WILL: He's a big bear.

MATT: He's a very big bear, and the moment that you glance over and give a look. Without even looking at you, you just hear this, (growls).

WILL: Okay, fair enough.

MATT: All right. Anything else you wish to prepare for the evening?

TALIESIN: I'm good.

MATT: All right. You all find yourselves asleep–

ALL: Wait, wait, wait!

LIAM: I'll take first watch.

(laughter)

WILL: Who's watching?

LIAM: What are you doing, man?

MARY: Then they all died in their sleep.

LAURA: You need to rest. You got beat up.

LIAM: We take fucking turns.

LAURA: You go to sleep. I'm going to stay up for a little bit because I'm fine.

MARY: I'll stay up with Vex.

LIAM: All right.

TALIESIN: Wake me up when you're done with your shift.

MARISHA: Yeah, wake me up whenever.

LAURA: We climb up in the tree and keep watch.

LIAM: I find the only empty spot of fur on Trinket left and snuggle into it.

MATT: Okay. The whole process of getting Trinket up into the tree itself is hilarious.

LAURA: It's difficult.

MATT: It's a group effort, to a certain extent. There's a difference between climbing a tree and getting up into a tree and then getting into a comfortable place where you can rest and not destroy the tree. It's a combination of minor druidic talents to create an element of the tree's growth that would be able to support a weight the size of a bear.

MARISHA: Yeah, I grow a basket.

MATT: Yeah. You've done it before.

TALIESIN: A bear basket.

LAURA: Trinket's very thankful.

MATT: All right, the two of you keep watch for the first watch. We'll say for about a four-hour period. Okay. As the end of your watch progresses, I need you both to make a perception check.

LAURA: Oh, shit.

MARY: Each of us?

MATT: The two that were taking watch. The twins.

LAURA: He went to bed. I was awake.

MARY: We stayed up.

WILL: Because something's coming out of Loch Anus.

SAM: A dark force is coming out of Loch Anus.

LAURA: It's okay, I'm good. 34.

MARY: Six.

MATT: Looking off towards the other side of the lake, you see, under what little bit of moonlight is peeking through the cloud cover over the area, which breaks up every now and then. You can see a few stars glistening, and a little of the moon peeks through. Catches your attention, specifically, as the moon is the essence of your patron. Through your vision, you can see a handful of small– I say small. Small from this distance, but relatively large, Trinket-sized furry entities that cluster up to the edge of the lake on the opposite side.

LAURA: Trinket-sized furry entities? I can't see if they're actually bears.

MATT: Not at this distance, no.

LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone around me, and I stealth. We're already stealthed.

TRAVIS: What's the circumference of the lake?

MATT: The full distance around it? I'd say 250 to 300 feet. It's not a huge lake.

TRAVIS: It's a giant pond.

WILL: So they're not that far away, then?

LAURA: 24.

MATT: They're about 50, 60 feet from you guys right now.

MARY: I have darkvision. Can I see them?

MATT: Darkvision up to a certain distance.

MARY: 60 feet.

MATT: I'd say, best you can look at it, you've encountered these in the past, and this appears to be a small group of evening-wandering owlbears that are passing through the vicinity.

LAURA: Owlbears!

MARY: I can talk to them.

LIAM: Big, angry bastards.

SAM: Oh, well why didn't you just say so?

MATT: They do not appear to notice your presence, and are just passing through.

LAURA: Let's just watch them.

MARY: What are they?

SAM: Throw things at them!

LAURA: We just sit and enjoy this magical moment of seeing the rare owlbear in person.

MARISHA: (whispering) So majestic.

SAM: Quick! Start eating a Tootsie Pop.

MARY: One.

LAURA AND MARY: Two.

ALL: Three!

(laughter)

MATT: Mr. Owl's bad, but Mr. Turtle was a real dick because he's the one who sent the kid to it, knowing full well the owl was going to eat that treat. The true villain's Mr. Turtle.

WILL: What about the education of the kid, where he's got to go to animals to learn things– oh, forget it.

LIAM: Half the audience is going, “yeah.” And half the audience is going, “what the fuck are they talking about?”

MATT: You get slightly nervous as the owlbears make their way closer to your edge of the lake, going to where the initial breaking of the ice was set by Grog. They all drink of the ice-cold water, and then eventually make their way scare on the opposite side of the forest.

LAURA: Did they leave any feathers behind?

MATT: A couple, maybe?

LAURA: After they get away, I want to climb down and gather the feathers that they left behind.

MATT: You find two owlbear feathers.

LAURA: Okay!

MARY: We can put them in our hair.

LAURA: I want to fletch an arrow. Owlbear arrows.

MATT: Okay. What kits do you have with you?

LAURA: Oh, shit. Really? You know. Those ones I have.

MATT: Make a dexterity check. Just a straight dexterity check.

LAURA: Okay.

LIAM: Where did you get those thieves' tools?

LAURA: I have thieves' tools because I'm a thief now.

LIAM: Where did you get them? Did you buy them?

LAURA: I stole them, dude.

LIAM: Stole them from where? When? I don't remember that. Did that happen in-game, or did you make that up?

LAURA: Matt told me I have thieves' tools! Dick. 27. 27 dexterity.

MATT: He is asleep. Talking in his sleep.

MARY: Voice in my head. Brother. Twin.

LAURA: Shut up!

MATT: You finish out the rest of your watch. Using the moonlight at your disposal, you manage to make a couple of owlbear arrows with the feathers you found.

LAURA: These are special.

MATT: They're functional. They'll do.

LAURA: Cool.

TRAVIS: They're fucking feathers.

LAURA: Shut up. I'm writing, “two owlbear arrows.”

MATT: Next watch?

LIAM: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Hello.

MATT: All right. You guys go to sleep. The two of you stay up. All right. You watch and the next four hours go by, unhindered.

LAURA: Oh, I warn them there's owlbears in the area before I go to sleep.

LIAM: Where? What the–

WILL: About three hours into their shift, can I come and relieve him?

LIAM: Wait! I wanted to talk to him. You've got to wait.

(laughter)

WILL: I'll wait. I'll wait.

LIAM: Percival.

TALIESIN: Yes?

LIAM: De Rolo. How are you doing? A lot's going on. A lot. But it hasn't been that long.

TALIESIN: No, I'm pleased for the distraction, honestly. I feel– (sighs)

LIAM: Has Orthax fully left the building?

TALIESIN: I don't hear anything anymore, if that's what you're asking.

LIAM: It is.

TALIESIN: I think– I think all I'm manifesting at this point is scars. Honestly, I feel a little lost now. I'm really not entirely sure what I'm doing with myself.

LIAM: Can I tell you, I believe you are a good man.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

LIAM: If you listen to your better angels, and they're within your friends. Listen to them. I don't want to be pushy. I'm sorry. But you have a family, if you want it.

TALIESIN: I know. I've been thinking, a lot, about why we're together and what we're doing.

LIAM: I think we all are, yeah.

TALIESIN: And the conclusion that I've been coming to so far (sighs) and Pike being the exception to this rule, as she's the exception to so many things, is I think we're very broken people, but I think together, we are far greater than the sum of our parts. I like who we are together, and I think that's important.

LIAM: I agree with that.

TALIESIN: And I like the influence that everyone has on each other, and this includes, perhaps, you taking some strides with yourself. (sighs)

LIAM: How do you mean?

TALIESIN: It's good to want things. It's very, very good to want things. It's also very, very good to have things. It's good to– it's good to find the things that are important to you and move towards them. I'm in a place where I'm realizing that I have to make decisions about what's important, and I'm a little envious that you seem to be ahead of the curve on that.

LIAM: I wish I felt that way.

TALIESIN: I know.

LIAM: Well. I started talking to you. I just– I'm sorry if I've done anything to offend you.

TALIESIN: Never.

LIAM: We're a bit of an awkward family, but we are trying.

TALIESIN: And I apologize for any of the mistakes I've made, and honestly any of the mistakes I'm likely to make, but I am starting to imagine a better version of myself. I'm not quite sure who that is yet, but there is a destiny, I think, for us all together.

LIAM: This is all a lot bigger than us individually now.

TALIESIN: We've been given mighty deeds to accomplish. We will rise. Or if we fail, no one will ever know. (chuckles)

LIAM: (laughs) There's comfort in that. All right. I've said my piece.

MATT: At which point, you hear a voice say, “Good. I'm trying to sleep.”

(laughter)

MATT: The clinking of armor as Kima rolls over on one of the branches and is face-palming at the conversation.

LIAM: You are really fucking cool. You know that, don't you?

MATT: At this point, you hear a distant screech that echoes across the night sky. All of you wake up. While not extremely loud, it is very noticeable and cuts through the silence, as there is a very still wind tonight.

LIAM: Even if my sister's waking up, I kick her hard in the ass.

LAURA: Ah! Fuck you!

MATT: You two, make a perception check.

SAM: Have we achieved our long rest yet?

MATT: Not yet, no.

LIAM: 22.

TALIESIN: 17.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: I have Pass Without a Trace cast on us–

MATT: As you went to sleep, you didn't.

LAURA: Shitballs…

(laughter)

MATT: As you guys are coming back to consciousness, you see a shape that's just– can't make out the actual details of it, but it coasts across the distant sky, across the clouds, and a little bit of moonlight framing the image.

TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News and I'm just going to try and use the scope to trail.

MATT: Okay. You pick it up and what you see in the distance is a very, very large bird, cresting across the distance. It doesn't appear to be coming in your direction, but it just slowly makes its way just over the opening in the canopy.

LIAM: I am of course reminded of the giant roc. Is it the same shape?

MATT: It's pretty damn close. It disappears over the opposite side–

SAM: Wait, is it our guy?

MARISHA: He lived!

LIAM: After I've kicked her, I grab Keyleth by the shoulder and I start waking her up. Roc. Roc. Roc!

MARISHA: Does it look like the same one?

MATT: It does. You catch it just before it disappears over the distant horizon. It arcs away and then vanishes past.

MARISHA: (whispering) He made it!

TALIESIN: It's very pretty, I don't understand what–

LAURA: It's the cow-roc. When we were cows! When we saved a roc.

TALIESIN: Was I? I don't think I was there.

MARISHA: Percy was having– you were having an episode. And locked yourself in the basement.

LAURA: Oh shit, Percy.

MARY: Kash, it's the big bird.

WILL: I remember that.

LAURA: You've seen it?

MARY and WILL: Of course, of course.

WILL: When were you cows?

MARISHA: Oh, it's a long story.

WILL: Okay, fair enough.

MARISHA: We saved him, though, and we told him to come here!

WILL: We see him all the time. A fixture in the night sky.

TRAVIS: It was just a bird? I go back to sleep.

MATT: The rest of you go back to sleep. You guys are finishing up your watch. Did you want to–?

WILL: I'll take a watch.

TALIESIN: All right, I'm out.

MATT: Okay. So is it just Kash taking this next one?

SAM: Oh, I'll– nope. (laughs) Do I need my sleep still?

MATT: No, you've had a full eight hours' rest.

SAM: Okay, I'll stay with you.

WILL: Good. We'll nap it up.

LAURA: I elbow him. You're snoring a-fucking-gain–

LIAM: Shut the fuck up.

SAM: So. I've seen you checking out some of the members of our little group, here.

WILL: This is a very interesting group you have here, that's for sure.

SAM: Listen, Vax doesn't fly that way, I don't think. I know you've been eyeing him pretty good.

WILL: Huh?

SAM: Vax. I'm just looking out for you, brother. He's not available for you.

WILL: What else do your keen eyes perceive?

SAM: I see the way you've been flirting with him. It's adorable.

WILL: That's funny. I didn't think anyone was going to pick up on it.

SAM: Well, I'm a romantic, so I notice these things.

WILL: You are that. You are that. He has a way about him, you have to admit.

SAM: He does. He has a flair– it's not my thing, obviously. I go for the lady hookers.

WILL: Well. To each his own, am I right?

SAM: Yes, yes, but no, you have good taste in men.

WILL: Yeah. Thank you.

SAM: He's a dashing young rogue.

WILL: He is. And this crew is lucky to have you.

SAM: Yes. Yes. They are. They really are. That's your keen eye at work!

WILL: Well. We all see what we see, don't we? Incredible. Just– incredible.

SAM: Can I give you a bit of advice?

WILL: Please. Please do.

SAM: You know, you have to follow your heart, so if you do have feelings for the lad, you at least have to tell him. Even if he won't return them to you.

WILL: It's funny, I've been wanting to have a conversation with him for quite a while now. We have a lot to discuss.

SAM: Oh yes, what about?

WILL: Oh, you know, this and that. Feelings, as you would call them. Romance, as you would say.

SAM: You are so in touch with those.

WILL: I know.

(laughter)

WILL: I do my best. When you've lived the sheltered and wonderful life I have–

SAM: Oh, yes?

WILL: It's not often you meet a man like that. So you run towards him. Some would say, with your spear out.

(laughter)

SAM: TMI, my friend. TMI–

WILL: That. Is funny. Well, you're right, we do have quite a bit to talk about.

SAM: Yeah, we have another two and a half hours on this watch.

LAURA: I wake up. Can you guys talk a little quieter? Some of us are sleeping.

WILL: Are you going to be able to get her on board with my little plan for her brother?

SAM: I think she just wants her brother to be happy, you know.

WILL: And that's wonderful. How do you come up with your songs, by the way?

SAM: Oh, well, you know. I think of like, a word, and then I try to think of a rhyme for it. Like, 'Kashaw', like, what could that be? That could be 'pshaw'! You know, something like that, I don't know, I'm working on that, I'm working on it.

WILL: That's amazing. It's a skill that I've never had before. But I guess as you said, when you really take in the world and can see people and how they feel, you can really write a powerful ballad.

SAM: I'm a man of the world, I'm well-traveled, I'm cultured–

TALIESIN: (snorts awake) Rickshaw, rickshaw– (snores)

SAM: Rickshaw's a good one! Let me tell you, secret weapon. I sleep near Percy a lot and he rhymes in his sleep. It's the strangest thing. Here, I'll show you, I'll show you. I haven't a fear in the world!

TALIESIN: (mutters incomprehensibly)

(laughter)

SAM: Sometimes it takes a while.

WILL: I don't. I don't understand.

SAM: It takes a while.

WILL: Okay.

TALIESIN: (mumbles) Something rhymes with world.

SAM: See? It's amazing. Every time. Every time.

WILL: Absolutely incredible.

MATT: As the hours pass–

(laughter)

MATT: Through intense conversation and learning about one another, the sky comes to a glow with the rising sun.

WILL: For the love of god, let something attack us.

MATT: The rest of the group finds themselves to consciousness. The cold morning air and frozen bits of early-morning dew across the grass and growth in the forest.

LIAM: Hm, my ears feel really hot this morning, I don't know why that is.

TALIESIN: I've been breathing on them.

LIAM: What?

TRAVIS: What about the little hole in the lake that we smashed? Is it still there, or did it freeze over?

MATT: The hole's still there, but there is a very thin layer of what appears to be forming ice that could be easily cracked.

TRAVIS: I got it, I'll do that. And I go and take my morning wee right on the little hole where it's starting to freeze back over.

MATT: There you go. Grog has now effectively peed in the Marrowglade Loch.

WILL: Kash walks over to also pee and looks down at Grog and goes, “Holy god.” And just turns and walks.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: And that's canon, folks.

TRAVIS: That's the sound of 20,000 pens hitting paper.

WILL: For the love of god.

MATT: Two weeks, folks. We've been storing this up. All right. So what's the plan, guys?

LAURA: I guess we should breathe underwater and head down, right?

WILL: Can we handle the cold, is the question I want to know.

MARISHA: That is true. How cold is that lake?

MATT: It's– the surface is near-freezing by the just general temperature of the morning air. You're liable to get hypothermia if you spend any extended period of time in the water.

LAURA: Extended period.

WILL: Can we send somebody down to try to find the entrance and get in before the rest of us go down there and flounder around?

LAURA: I can, well. I have really good perception, so. I can go down and see if I can find an opening that you guys didn't see yesterday.

LIAM: I'm going to take a walk around the whole thing and see if I can see anything on the edges.

MARISHA: How big– you said the lake was like 350 feet–

MATT: It's about 350 feet circumference around. It's not a very, very large–

WILL: I can destroy water, but I don't know.

MARISHA: I can control water.

LAURA: Could you, like, make a, you know, parting of the Red Sea sort of thing?

MARISHA: I might be able to, actually, yeah.

LAURA: Try that.

LIAM: Did a 22 perception check around the edge of the loch find anything?

MATT: Nothing beyond the edge of the lake. There isn't, I mean, you find bits and pieces of broken stone, but nothing that seems to be indicative of a change in topography.

TALIESIN: I would actually say breathe underwater would be the safer bet in case something happens. If we have to escape, we don't want to necessarily rely on your consciousness.

SAM: I can make us all look like fish.

LAURA: Oh, that's good. Useful. That could be useful if something was attacking and they wouldn't attack fish.

TALIESIN: Yes, they're like, oh look, fish, I'm not going to eat that. I'm so bored of it.

SAM: I'll workshop that one.

LIAM: Yeah, it's good that you have it, but just hold onto it for a rainy day.

MARISHA: I can focus to part the waters for about ten minutes.

LIAM: Ten minutes? That's more than enough time.

LAURA: I'll run in, search around.

SAM: You? We'll all run in!

LAURA: We'll all run in, search around like maniacs for ten minutes.

LIAM: Grog, are you ready to dig?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MARISHA: And then if we don't find anything, then I can still cast Breathe Water on us.

SAM: How much water can you displace?

MATT: A cube of up to 100 feet on a side, so you could pretty much part the entire lake.

LAURA: Let's do it and run down and search.

MARY: In doing so, could she get all the water out of the lake so that it would be gone forever, or is it just a temporary parting?

LAURA: I feel like that's killing a lot of wildlife.

MARISHA: Are there a lot of fish in here?

MATT: You've been around. There are some fish that live in here.

LIAM: Let's just get in there. Let's not destroy the loch.

MARISHA: Yeah, I probably can't even get all of it out, but let me– Let me see what I can do.

MATT: So you cast Control Water?

MARISHA: I guess I cast Control Water.

LAURA: Keyleth, I have total faith in you.

MARISHA: Thank you.

SAM: Go, Keyleth. Go.

MATT: As Keyleth completes the spell in a rapid series of hand motions, concentrating, her eyes illuminate with the power of her druidic, divine energies. She extends her hands and the water itself in the center of the lake, the ice cracks up, almost like a fissure is building in the center. It's almost like tin foil being folded back from the inside out. The ice is actually breaking and being pulled to the sides, and as the ice is pulled back, the water is pulled back with it, like someone has torn into the surface of the earth and peeled the ice back like a sheet. It forms this long tunnel that leads directly down into the center of the lake. The water is being held aloft over the surface, not actually being cast to the sides out into the river. You could empty the lake, for the most part, if you wanted to do it now, but right now you're just holding it aloft as these two water pillars.

TALIESIN: Could you build an ice tunnel, perhaps? Take some of the ice and actually structure a–

MARISHA: I was going to say, actually, I think as Control Water, I can also change if it freezes and if it's solid? Can I freeze the edges of this? Make an awesome–

MATT: You cannot refreeze water with this spell, unfortunately. You can just control its shape. The temperature is a whole different ballgame.

TALIESIN: But there is frozen– we could take the existing ice and create–

LAURA: You know what? I'm running in. And Keyleth, just be ready to throw it away.

MARISHA: I'm just going to focus and keep pushing it out.

LAURA: I run in and start looking for anything.

MARISHA: Go! Move fast, you have ten minutes!

MARY: I go to the entrance that was blocked and I investigate to see whether or not there's any way we can climb our way through. Focus on the non-vegetative spots and get in.

LAURA: I'm going to that and seeing if there's something there.

MATT: Okay. The stonework– you can start pulling the stones that block the area that lead into that one collapsed entrance, and yeah. You start moving things out of the way and they tumble down to the bottom and stick into the mud. The bottom of the pond is a very interesting sight when it's drained. All the plant life is just sucked together and you're all sloshing through. You're up to your knees with each step as you just sink into the mud.

SAM: It's a super muddy “ahnus.”

MARISHA: I am going to go ahead and start pushing some of the water outwards, out of the lake as I'm keeping it pushed.

LAURA: I go to the hole, to the “ahnus,” and start looking.

MATT: Looking in there, as you begin to step into the mud, it is a thicker portion and your feet begin to sink into it.

TALIESIN: You can control water. Can you control the water in the mud?

MARISHA: I've got a lot on my mind right now, Percy!

TALIESIN: Okay. Okay, I was just throwing it out there.

MATT: To a certain extent, you can control elements of it, but because the earth itself is not part of it, it does resist the spell effect, so it would be very minimal effects. As you step into it, you begin to sink.

LAURA: Oh, I just stepped right in, because I'm really smart, you guys. Hold onto me.

LIAM: I start pulling.

MATT: Make a strength check.

LIAM: Oh, thank god I'm so strong. That is– I'm going to use Luck, and that's shit.

LAURA: I'm going. I'm sinking. Grog?

LIAM: 11. 11?

MATT: All right. The two twins are now, (sucking sound) being pulled in into this small mire.

TRAVIS: What happened to you two?

LAURA: Grog, help. Seriously, quick.

LIAM: Remember how happy you were that I was alive? That's not going to last much longer.

LAURA: Come on, come on. Grog, help!

TRAVIS: How deep are they?

MATT: She's about up to her waist now.

TRAVIS: Nah, you're good. Just swim.

MATT: Up to upper torso. Vax is now getting to right around upper thigh.

TRAVIS: Oh, look. I mean, you're not even twinsies about it. You're at different lengths. You've got to even out a bit.

WILL: Don't struggle, or you'll sink faster.

MATT: Trinket's all, (concerned grunts).

LAURA: I take out my Rope of Infinite Twine and throw it to Trinket's mouth from far away.

MATT: (chomp, grunt)

LAURA: Pull. Me. Out.

MATT: All right, and with that, Trinket begins to back up. (sucking footsteps) Can't get traction in the mud. He's trying to pull, but is sliding in space.

LAURA: This sucks, you guys!

TALIESIN: I'm going to try to grab the rope.

LAURA: Grog, why are you being a dick-fuck? I need to get out of this mud. Seriously?

TALIESIN: Ugh. That's a 12.

MATT: There's no movement on this point. You guys are trying to pull and they're not sinking right at the moment. There is tension on the rope, but they're not being pulled out, either. They're just held in place.

MARISHA: You all had better be making damn good use of this time!

LAURA: Great use, Keyleth. We found an entrance point. Ish.

SAM: Are we just at the edge of the pond?

MATT: You guys are now in the center of the base of the pond.

SAM: But we haven't gotten to the part–

MATT: No, you guys are at the base of the stone structure, which is not too far from the section they're sinking in.

LIAM: Dying in slow motion over here.

MATT: You've been pulling rocks away from the crumbled entrance, which is much easier now that there isn't water pressed against it, so you're actually moving rocks out of the way, and you're making some headway into this entrance.

MARY: Do I even see them?

MATT: You see out of the corner of your eye, them talking and shouting to each other.

MARY: Grog, come over here! Darling, I've got some rocks you can move. Maybe we can get in on this side.

LAURA: You're not going to even help? Cool.

MARY: I can't see you. Corner of my eye. I hear you squabbling. You guys squabble all the time.

TRAVIS: Now, what are we moving?

LAURA: Seriously, we're dying! We're going to die.

LIAM: We are sinking in the mud over here!

MATT: Kima runs up to you guys, looks over and goes, “Ah, they're fine,” and starts grabbing rocks.

TRAVIS: Here we go, let's move this shit.

SAM: Hey, guys, you want a hand?

LAURA: Yes. Please get us out with Bigby.

SAM: So I will cast Bigby's Hand. And I will gently lift them up and cup them as I pull them up from the muck.

MATT: Easy enough to do. The giant, shimmering arcane hand of Bigby scoops both of the twins up and dislodges them from the muddy surface, setting you guys down gently, and drifts to your side with a thumbs-up.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Since we have Bigby's Hand, why don't we use it to–

SAM: Sure, sure, sure. What do you need me to lift?

LAURA: Can you scoop out all the mud in that fucking hole that just tried to kill us?

SAM: All right, let's scoop. We're scooping. I'm scooping.

MATT: Are you scooping mud, or are you scooping stone? I didn't hear which one you're doing.

SAM: I go with Zahra. What do you want me to scoop, Zahra?

MARY: Oh, well, did I even hear any of this? I'm still over there with Grog, moving–

TRAVIS: We're moving rocks.

MARY: We're moving rocks. (louder) I think we're going to move rocks. Can you give us a hand with the rocks?

SAM: Sure. Here it comes. Whee!

MATT: Okay. (laughs) I'll say, the two of you guys make strength checks, and you go ahead and roll a d20 and add your charisma– no, Bigby's Hand is–

TRAVIS: 20.

TALIESIN: Wow, that's your wisdom modifier. Holy cow.

SAM: Is that good or bad?

TALIESIN: That's awful. That's amazing. I've never seen anything like it.

MATT: Yeah, plus eight to it.

SAM: 16.

MATT: 16, okay. 20 and?

MARY: Four.

MATT: Four. So you're “helping.”

MARY: I'm more of a delegator.

MATT: Yeah, you're the foreman of this exercise. But between Grog and Bigby's Hand, though, large sections of stone are being scooped out and tossed to the side.

MARISHA: I start tossing water out of this lake.

MATT: You're hitting the five- to six-minute mark. It's a ten-minute duration. You're a little past halfway.

MARISHA: Seeing that they're still doing a lot of work, I'm going to start seeing if I can push some of this water out of the lake a bit.

MATT: Okay. You push some of the water out of the way. Some of it is splashing off to the side and being soaked into the local dirt and earth. You're still holding about half of the pond itself up at the sides. You guys are beginning to make headway through, and you see a lot of the stones here have been pushed in with suction from the mud and kept a barrier, and about three minutes later, you begin to find an opening, and you start pulling out a big plug of stone, and you can see beyond that, there is an actual stairway, and a pitch-black, lightless entrance that goes deeper into this actual structure.

TALIESIN: Let's go.

TRAVIS: Well, problem. Stairway, but when water comes back in, you drown in that stairway. So–

WILL: We'll have to block it up behind us.

MARY: Once this is done, can you cast one of those–

MARISHA: Maybe? I start walking towards them.

LAURA: Once we're in and water's covering it, we're not going to be able to get these stones away.

LIAM: Keyleth, can you walk down this way while still doing that, and Scanlan, can you use Bigby's Hand to block the hole once Keyleth is past you?

SAM: For a very small amount of time.

LIAM: Yeah, and then Keyleth, can you make a wall of stone once you've let down the water?

MARISHA: Yes, if we try and go super fast.

LIAM: Let's do it.

MARY: I can cast Light and get us down there.

SAM: Okay, I can make a wall behind us or something.

MARISHA: I go and start heading towards the tunnel and pushing all the water outwards.

MATT: Okay, so keeping the water at bay, now rotating around your movement into the center, you all make your way towards that rocky entrance. It's just big enough to get each of you through, Grog and Trinket, at the very largest. You all push your way through, climbing in the other side. Keyleth, concentrating, steps inside as the last one as you begin, with the last few minutes you have.

SAM: I guess I'll just pack it with mud and rocks, right?

MATT: Just taking it all. Chunk after chunk after chunk. Just at the tail end of your concentration. The hand pulls in the last plug as the water (crashing water sound) comes crashing into itself, filling the space. As you all are standing there, the light of Zahra's staff lighting the area, there's the impact of water rushing in against the stonework, and you can feel the whole place shake from the impact, and immediately water begins to rush in through the cracks of this created section.

LAURA: Oh!

SAM: I'm not a good builder!

(laughter)

LIAM: Hold it, Scanlan, hold it for a moment!

MATT: I was going to say, based on the push of the water against the rock and Bigby's Hand against that, I need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight for Bigby's strength to try and hold the plug in place.

SAM: 24.

MATT: 24 total roll. With that impact, you can see streams of water pushing through and mud and other elements filling the gaps of the stonework, Bigby's Hand pushing up against it. Looks like the stonework was ready to give, and the water begins to go ahead and fill this vicinity, the hand pushes back until the streams that are peeking through turn to a trickle, and by the time the spell finally comes to an end, the hand vanishes, the plugged hole gives a little bit, and then seems to keep itself in place. Water's still dribbling out and trickling, there is still a gradual bit of moisture passing through here, and you don't know how long it'll hold, but for the time being, it seems to be holding.

SAM: Yikes.

MARY: Well done, Scanlan.

SAM: Thank you for the idea.

LIAM: Well, we could risk it or– Keyleth, are you able to put up a wall?

TALIESIN: I think we can risk it for now.

TRAVIS: Yeah, risk it. Because we have to come back through this way, probably.

LAURA: That's true, if something happens you can put it up.

MARISHA: Let's head downstairs, and we might not need to worry about this in a second.

TRAVIS: Hey, sneaky-sneaky, go take a look.

LIAM: Are you talking to her or me?

TRAVIS: No, you, shitbrain.

LAURA: Hey, you know what? We're not doing anything for you, you fuck, 'cause you didn't even try to help us.

TRAVIS: Oh, look at me, digging in a muddy hole that led to nowhere.

LIAM: I let them argue and I skulk forward. While they're fighting. Natural 20.

WILL: See that? My man's going to check some stuff out.

SAM: Ah, you must be so proud.

WILL: Very excited.

MATT: So, as Vax vanishes from your sight, disappearing into the shadows down the stairway that leads forward, we're going to take a quick break.

(cheering)

MATT: We'll be right back, so get your snacks, get your bathroom on, we'll be here as soon as possible.

LIAM: Get your Purvan.

ALL: Get your Purvan!

MATT: You're all going to die. All of you.

MARY: And they never made it out of the tunnel.
Break

[break]
Part II

MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So we've had our little break here, a couple quick announcements to give to you guys. One, our first winner of the giveaway today, of the chatroom giveaway for our various prize package is BlackDeath2099.

(laughter)

MATT: Congratulations. I'm glad we have a little ways off before we have to worry about that. Or maybe Marvel will rekindle that comic series. But yeah, so, congratulations, BlackDeath2099. Also, a reminder to all of our European viewers, we here in the US, 'cause we're ridiculous and still do this whole time change thing, we are springing forward, it's our Daylight Savings, so the show will actually be airing an hour earlier for you guys, which might be pretty good for you guys.

WILL: So everyone can work on the farms.

MARISHA: Yes. Which no one– and it doesn't even work there.

WILL: Damn you, Benjamin Franklin.

MARY: What is today for Critical Role?

MATT: Today is our one-year anniversary of the stream.

(cheering)

MATT: We were so rushed at the start, we didn't get around to it.

LAURA: We didn't even talk about how it's our one-year anniversary–

MATT: It's our one-year, it's been a rushed day.

SAM: What do you get for a one-year anniversary? Is it paper?

MARISHA: Paper.

WILL: I got it!

(cheering)

WILL: Happy anniversary.

MATT: So, I mean, thank you guys.

MARISHA: We get tons of fan art, that's paper.

LAURA: That is paper.

MATT: Thank you guys for kicking along with us for a year.

LIAM: We got a very nice anniversary present from Megzilla. From Meg.

LAURA: Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful.

MARISHA: It's my background now.

LAURA: Mine too! Is yours just you? 'Cause mine is just me and Pike!

MARISHA: Me and Pike, it's the only ones, 'cause it can't fit all of us, you have to try and frame it.

LIAM: She's a unifying entity.

MATT: Also, guys, wanted to let you know before we get started here again. You helped our good friend here Ivan, is doing his Kickstarter for the ABC's of RPG's, which is awesome, but one of the stretch goals was to actually have a few pages of Critical Role-related activities for kids within the book, and you guys succeeded in smashing through that stretch goal, so he gave me a couple of the early designs to show off. Here's the–

LAURA: We can show it?

MATT: Yeah, we can show a little bit of the preliminary stuff. So this is the Vex and Vax connect-the-dots.

(cheering)

MATT: So this'll be part of the presentation of that activity, which is fantastic.

LAURA: And this is artwork by Wendy.

MARISHA: Put it on the thing, on the paper.

MATT: On the paper?

MARISHA: Right on– right, yeah. There you go.

MATT: Then we have here, we have the create tattoos for Grog activity sheet.

LIAM: Yes! Yes, I can draw all the penises I want on him!

MATT: So there's that one there. And then here we have the Percy connect your knowledge of the various fantasy creatures activity book.

LAURA: Baby, baby creatures!

WILL: I'd like to point out, the rakshasa with the hands. It's doing jazz hands!

MATT: So those are the really cool art pieces you can look forward to, you guys kicked ass on making that happen and so we have our own little stamp in his amazing creative piece, so thank you for that. Look to that. There's also more stretch goals, I think, before it finishes up, so if you want to smash those records, feel free to check it out.

TALIESIN: Smash.

MATT: Thank you for letting us be part of that, Ivan.

MARY: Grog smash with moon hammer.

MATT: All right. So. Now. As you guys– bringing it back to the game, here. I think those are all the announcements I'm supposed to make there, perfect. Let me get set up here with some proper audio. I want to get some good atmosphere here.

TRAVIS: Imperial Death March?

MARY and LAURA: (sing Imperial March)

(all warble Imperial March)

TALIESIN: Are we Death Star chickens? What's happening?

MATT: That got weird.

LIAM: They just cut the power on our show.

MATT: So. Are you guys all staying at the top of the stairs, or are you staying a little bit behind Vax's movement?

LIAM: I'm 20 feet ahead.

LAURA: We're moving– But we should probably, I don't know, stealth? I don't know what would be alive down here, but there might be undead. Actually, can I take a moment and use Primeval Awareness and sense if there's any undead entities around, any ghostly or undead zombies? Anything undead?

LIAM: And I– sorry. Rolled a 30 for perception.

LAURA: Aberrations?

MATT: Which one are you focusing on? I think you have to choose the type.

LAURA: Let's start with undead.

MATT: Undead? You take a moment, focusing here–

LAURA: Up to six miles.

MATT: Yes. As Vax pushes forward. Nothing catches your attention, undead-wise. There are no undead entities within the vicinity which you can focus on, so that's one thing you don't got to worry about.

LAURA: One thing.

WILL: I think because Z is in the front with her light, Kash backs all the way up to the back and lights a light, as well.

MATT: All right, so the two of you have light from this pitch-dark vicinity, which is helpful for those of human descent. No undead presence in the vicinity. Vax, pushing down this stairwell, it continues down with a slight curvature, almost like a gradual spiral staircase, until eventually it hits a floor area. The flooring here is at a tilt. From what you can see, this whole tomb, this whole ruin, when it sank in, it sank at a slight angle, and the surface of all the stonework here is still slick with water and various liquid that has trickled through over time. You get the sense that there are a number of leaks within this temple, and the pond that would grow larger is steadily slipping into this ruin, and then being filled over time from the rainy and snowy weather as it hits the area. As you hit the bottom and you look around, you see ahead, immediately across the way, as you're the first in there, two small humanoid shapes down this T-junction. To the right and left of you are two tunnels, and there is one ahead, and about 35 to 40 feet ahead of you, you see two humanoid individuals.

LIAM: We've already got company. I see two small little buggers ahead of me. I don't know what they are.

LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on the group.

SAM: Can you kill them?

LIAM: I don't know yet. Just wait for a second. I'm going to sit for a minute. One minute, and see what they do.

LAURA: Can we stealth?

MARISHA: Yeah, let's all stealth.

MATT: All right. Everyone roll stealth. Are you keeping your light spells up?

MARY and WILL: No.

MATT: Both of you snuff the light spells, so you have zero visibility right now.

LIAM: I am really well-hidden.

MARY: I've got darkvision.

TRAVIS: I do, too.

SAM: So do I.

MATT: Stealth checks from everybody?

LIAM: I am covered in mud.

LAURA: Oh, that's true. We are really camouflaged.

LIAM: The twins are dark right now.

MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

LAURA: No, add ten to it.

MARISHA: 11.

WILL: 14.

TALIESIN: 32.

SAM: 30.

MARY: 22.

LAURA: 28.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: 17. With the plus ten?

WILL: 14.

MATT: 14. With the plus ten?

WILL: No, then it's 24.

MATT: 24. Okay.

LIAM: Is there any light here? Dim light?

MATT: There is no light.

MARY: We just doused it. Grog and I can see.

TRAVIS: Darkvision.

MATT: These two figures just walk beyond. What little bit you can see, and both of you guys roll perception checks, those with darkvision right now.

SAM: Oh, wait. Darkvision?

MARY: Natural 20. Natural 20.

WILL: Yeah! That's your second one?

TRAVIS: 14.

MATT: 14. The two of you can see these entities. They're humanoid. Bipedal– two arms, two legs, standing up on their legs. However, their feet are these webbed claw-type physicality. They're wearing haphazard leather tunics, wrappings around their wrists, and they're hunched forward as they're walking away from you, deeper into the shadows. Seemingly completely unnoticing of your presence. Their heads are these bowed-forward fish-type visions. You can see they have these bulbous eyes at the edges, jagged, toothy mouths that end at this small point to the end. Very, very fish-like, amphibious-type entities. They both scuffle alongside each other and shuffle into the darkness beyond, down that further hallway.

LIAM: They're walking in pitch black, right?

MATT: Yes.

MARY: We have tunnels left and right?

MATT: Left and right and in front, where they both disappeared.

MARY: We don't hear them speaking, we don't hear them doing anything?

MATT: No, they're just walking.

MARISHA: Do they look to be on patrol? Are they walking back and forth?

MATT: They're just walking. They haven't turned back.

WILL: Are they armed?

MATT: Yes, you can see, both of them have what looks to be a cluster of ropes to one side, hanging off their belt, and have spears that they're clutching and walking along.

MARY: Are the ropes attached to the spears?

MATT: No.

MARY: Do they have eyeballs?

MATT: They do.

MARY: What color are they? I'm sorry.

MATT: There's no color in darkvision. It's black and white.

TRAVIS: Everyone listen up. There's two of them and they're walking away from us down a hall. They don't see us yet.

MARY: They appear to be some sort of fish-like creature. They've got spears and ropes.

LAURA: You know what? I bet if they live in the dark, light will blind them.

MARY: You know? You're very smart.

LIAM: Are we all huddled together at this point?

MATT: They've all gathered down to the bottom–

LIAM: They came up behind me, right? Yeah, so you're talking into your ear to me.

LAURA: Guess what?

LIAM: What? What's going on?

LAURA: There's fish people up ahead.

LIAM: It sounded like that, but I can't see shit down here. Zahra, you were able to see?

MARISHA: I poke my head in between the twins and I go, do you guys have an earache? Does your ear hurt?

LAURA: Can you see us? We can't see anything.

LIAM: You can't see shit, either.

LAURA: Should we get some light?

MARY: Should we– there's a tunnel to the left and there's a tunnel to the right.

LIAM: I pull out my Flametongue Dagger and make dim light.

MATT: Okay, so as the dagger gives off a bit of flame, those of you with low-light vision have extended visual at this point. At this point, too, as you're adjusting to the atmosphere here, there is this very heavy smell of mold and mildew throughout this entire area, and looking down, you can see the bit of light dances across the stone floor that has water trickling across it and leading to one side, to the left, with the tilt of the floor. What do you wish to do?

LIAM: Well, we can follow the fish brothers, or we could check out these two tunnels.

TRAVIS: I like that.

LAURA: I have a question. In my book that I bought for 30 gold, did it mention what level of the multi-level tomb the champion was buried on?

MATT: No, there wasn't much detail about the tomb's actual build. It spoke more of the history of the man who was buried there and gave reference to the direction you were traveling to, just to reaffirm you were going in the right way.

LIAM: You got played.

LAURA: I got played. It was a worthless 30 gold, then.

MATT: No, you learned information about the history of the man who's buried here. It's not like every stone structure of ancient history has a book of blueprints available at your local 7-Eleven.

WILL: That was 60 gold.

MATT: Yeah, that's a little more expensive.

MARY: All right, Grog. Since you and I have darkvision– Is it still– did you cast Light?

MATT: No, you can see Vax is holding out his flame dagger. It has a little bit of fire trickling off it. It's ever-so-gently lighting the very local area.

MARY: I'd like to investigate the tunnel to the left.

TRAVIS: And I'll look at the one on the right.

MATT: To the left. You go to the one on the right.

TRAVIS: I tell Vax to stay on my six as I go up.

WILL: And I follow Z.

MATT: Okay. So we have Grog and Vex are heading to the right?

LAURA: Vax.

MATT: Sorry. Grog and Vax are heading to the right, and Zahra and Kash are going to the left. Anyone else? Everyone else staying in the center?

TALIESIN: Staying center.

MARISHA: I'll stay center with Percy.

SAM: I'm going to go with Zahra.

MARY: I've noticed that you all have some sort of earpiece. Do you have any extra?

SAM: No, but I'm going to go with you, so I'll be able to report.

WILL: Oh, great.

MATT: Okay, two of you stay behind.

SAM: Kash, are you sure you don't want to go with Vax?

WILL: No, I'm good. Thank you.

SAM: All right.

MATT: All right, so. Grog and Vax, you guys traverse to the right, with what little light he's giving off the dagger. It continues for about 15 feet before it curves sharply to the right. Roll a perception check, Grog.

TRAVIS: I have that darkvision, too. That's not bad. 17.

MATT: 17? You turn the corner and manage to stop yourself just as your feet meet the edge of where the stone flooring has dropped out. The tunnel itself here just seems to have ended, and there is a chasm that disappears beneath your visual range. A couple of stones (cracking noise) crumble–

TRAVIS: Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Get back. Back up.

MATT: You hear them, after a number of seconds, eventually hit with a slight splash of water.

LIAM: What is it?

TRAVIS: I just think you should go in front of me here, is all.

LIAM: You think I should go– you want me to scout ahead?

TRAVIS: Yeah, it looks a little slick, but just go ahead, just real careful.

LIAM: All right, I walk past–

TRAVIS: No, I'm kidding! Jesus, it falls off into eternity. It's instant death.

LIAM: What the fuck is wrong with you?!

(laughter)

TRAVIS: What, you can't see?

LIAM: I really can't get a bead on you.

LAURA: Can you guys keep it down? I can hear you from here.

TRAVIS: I grab my earring and I say, I'm on the right. It is a dead end all the way.

MARY: Can you see down the hole?

LAURA: Is it a dead end? So it's a wall in front of you.

LIAM: I grasp his giant fucking forearm and lean out with the dagger, and how far can I see with this dim light?

MATT: You can see that this collapsed portion goes for about 20, 25 feet, and then the path continues beyond that for about another 20, 25 feet, and then comes to a halt at the opposite side.

LIAM: So there's a big gap and then there's more path further.

TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like 20 feet. Does anybody climb on anything?

LAURA: Do you see any openings down there?

LIAM: You're not here. You don't even know what we're doing!

LAURA: Shit.

TRAVIS: Can't you climb on shit?

LIAM: I can, but let's see what the others find on their end, and then we'll figure out if we want to deal with this.

TRAVIS: All right. Hey, Scanlan.

SAM: Oi.

TRAVIS: What did you and Zahra find?

SAM: Well–

MATT: So as you guys continue down the other way–

(laughter)

WILL: Meanwhile–

MARY: Back at the ranch.

MATT: You guys step down this surface, and the water is pouring down this way, and as you step, there's this squishing sound. Not from the water, but there is, every ten or so feet, there's a patch of very thick, mucus-y slime that seems to cover portions of the wall and portions of the floor. You slip a little bit and catch yourself, and there is a residue that you have to slough off your boots.

WILL: This is never going to be good.

MATT: Eventually, the tilted tunnel comes to a very tight spiral staircase that descends further down.

MARY: Scanlan, tell them I can see some sort of spiral staircase, but there seems to be a lot of goo here, and I'm always wary of goo.

SAM: Goo is rarely good. We should continue on to find out.

MARY: I agree. Should we– Do we check in with the others and see?

WILL: What are you holding your ear for?

SAM: This is something we all do. I don't know why, we don't need to do this. It's just a thing.

TRAVIS: It's like Professor X.

SAM: You know what? I'm going to try it without. It might feel weird. (louder) Grog, can you hear me? Grog, can you hear me?

TRAVIS: Oh, now I can hear you.

SAM: See, it doesn't work that way.

(laughter)

SAM: Grog, there's a spiral staircase and some snot. So we're going to keep going.

LAURA: Wait, wait. You're going down into the snotty–

SAM: Talking to Grog!

TALIESIN: Let's all go down into the spiral staircase.

LIAM: I heard it, as well. We don't want to split up. Wait there for a minute.

MARISHA: Is there any moss-snot near Percy and I, in the middle of the hall?

MATT: Looking about your general vicinity, very quickly. At your foot, yeah, there's some.

MARISHA: Can I do a check– A snot check?

MATT: Make a nature check.

MARISHA: That one failed me.

WILL: I blame the dice.

MARISHA: Get out of here. Let's do the wood one. Oh, that's good. 29.

MATT: Taking the slickness of it, you were expecting some sort of secretion, and there is no acridness to it. There is nothing about it that seems to jump out at you as a natural creation by a creature. You're not quite sure what the source of it could be. It could be, somehow, over time, slickness that came in through the water, or some other source. You really, in your experience as a druid, have no clear idea as to where this may have come from.

MARISHA: So it's not from a creature, but it is natural?

MATT: It doesn't appear to be natural. The viscousness doesn't match anything you've encountered from nature, so you're not sure what the source is. It doesn't appear to be like a large snail or something like that. The only reason you would know that is from your experience with subterranean creatures, and studying that in your books, and as you go through what you've researched, nothing jumps out at you.

TALIESIN: You've milked a lot of snails, and you've never seen anything like this.

WILL: (laughs) This is the strangest snail milk I've ever seen.

MARY: Does it have any aroma?

MATT: No, actually. No aroma whatsoever. It is relatively featureless other than its viscous texture.

SAM: I'm going to pull a Grog and taste it.

MARISHA: You said there's no acridness?

MATT: Okay, I need you guys to both– no, I'm kidding.

(laughter)

MATT: Flavorless.

MARISHA: Hey, guys. I don't trust this goo. It creeps me out. Just be careful.

LIAM: On our end, there's a big chasm over here, and there is a path on the other side of it, but we'd have to get over the chasm.

MARISHA: I mean, we can manage that, if you think it's not a dead end.

LIAM: But you've got a complete stairway over there with boogers on it.

TALIESIN: I think we want to head down. Down is the way to go.

MATT: They've gone beyond your vision. You don't see them. The path just continues on in the direction they were walking. They have not noticed you and have not seemingly returned yet.

TRAVIS: Like a sentry, I just keep looking that way.

MARY: I think we should go down.

WILL: What do you think about a little bit of light?

MARY: I can still see in the dark for a little while. Let's not alert anything of our presence.

MATT: The two of you are fumbling in complete darkness right now.

LAURA: It's really fucking dark.

MARY: When you cast Light, do you get to control the amount of light, or is it just–

MATT: Sure. I don't see why not.

MARY: All right. I'll cast Light and keep my staff behind me, a faint candlelight as I continue to use my darkvision.

MATT: So do you guys return with the rest of the group, and the group continues down the spiral staircase?

LAURA: I want to keep an eye out for any traps or anything.

MARISHA: I keep an eye on the goo.

TRAVIS: I'll stay in the very back and leaving the Dust of Tracelessness.

MATT: At this point, Trinket finally comes down the rest of the staircase, staying back from the rest of the group, being stealthy.

MARY: Trinket, have you ever experienced anything like this? Do you know anything about this gooey shite?

MATT: Trinket is actually far behind. You'd have to back up to converse.

MARY: All right. Never mind.

MATT: You guys have quite a large group here, especially with Kima involved. You have quite the party. This is going to be very interesting to see how it–

SAM: We're all in the same tunnel now?

MATT: You guys are all making your way down the left tunnel, down the spiral staircase that Zahra found. So. You progress downward. You're looking for–?

LIAM: Traps. I'm looking for traps.

MATT: Just keeping an eye out?

LIAM: Yeah, I'm using the light from her thumb or whatever.

MARY: My staff.

LAURA: I want to look for any imperfections in the stairs that look like they could collapse at any time or they could be unsafe.

MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks with disadvantage.

MARISHA: Disadvantage?

MATT: Very low light.

LIAM: I don't know why I rolled both at the same time. 22 for me.

LAURA: 28 for me.

TALIESIN: That's a disadvantage roll.

MATT: Coursing down, what catches your eye is a little ways down the spiral staircase, there are a couple of small, dark, what look like minor objects that stand out against the rest of the stone structure.

LAURA: Can I crouch down and look at it and see what it is?

MATT: They appear to be a couple of dark feathers. They are beneath an actual layer of slick slime. They've been there for a while, but there are two feathers.

LAURA: Do they look like the owlbear feathers that I picked up earlier?

MATT: No, actually. Owlbear feathers are textured, with some layers of color, like a natural owl-type entity would have. These are jet black. You recognize it very quickly.

LAURA: Hey, Keyleth? Have you ever seen feathers like this?

MARISHA: Do they appear to be raven feathers?

MATT: They are raven feathers, yes.

LAURA: Why were they covered in goo?

MARISHA: Maybe this was some sort of offering to the Raven Queen? We might be getting close.

LAURA: Fuck. The Raven Queen. Right, that makes sense.

MARY: Well done.

LAURA: Thank you. You guys: ravens.

MARISHA: Ravens, yeah. Onward.

MATT: Pressing down the spiral staircase. It comes to another floor beneath the one you just hailed from. Go ahead and make another perception check, you guys going forward. It's the two of you at the front?

LAURA: Yeah.

MARY: Do you need more light? You all right?

LAURA: Oh, was I supposed to still be at disadvantage?

MATT: If she's behind you with a very faint bit of candlelight. You guys have low-light vision, so you can still make these checks right now, but it's at disadvantage because it's very, very limited.

LIAM: 22.

LAURA: 26.

WILL: The twins, baby.

MATT: All right. As you guys push forward, you reach out and stop Vax before he takes another step as you notice this pathway now, hatchbacking back in the direction you guys had come from on the lower floor. You can see these very, very thin, about two inch wide slits in the stone walls to each side of you.

LIAM: I'm going to take a closer look at those things. Do I need to roll anything if I see them now, because she's pointed them out?

MATT: She pointed them out.

LIAM: I'm going to try to disarm them. They look like things I've seen before. They look like traps. I'm going to try to disarm them.

MATT: Okay. Go for it.

MARY: I extend my staff and I raise the light just a bit so you can see.

LAURA: Does it look like traps? You want to perceive them?

LIAM: What is disarm traps? Dexterity check?

MATT: This would be using your thieves' tools, and for this it would be– I will make this an intellect check, with the tools.

LIAM: An intellect check? Not the thieves' tools?

MATT: Thieves' tools, proficiency, plus your intelligence modifier.

LIAM: Plus the intelligence modifier?

MATT: Correct, because this is– you actually have not encountered this type of trap before, and you're trying to ascertain its nature without setting it off.

TRAVIS: I need popcorn for this.

LIAM: 23, then.

LAURA: Wow, you're really smart.

MATT: 23?

LIAM: Yeah.

MATT: As you step forward and begin to try, pulling your tools out to inspect the nature of these, looking into the dark paths on each side, there's an instantaneous movement, like a puff of air that comes out of each side. I need you to roll a dexterity save.

LIAM: Instinctually, I do evasion, if it's dexterity. I rolled a 12 plus– 22.

MATT: 22? All right, you (zoomf) just out of the way as these two pendulum blades (whoosh) right past you, missing you by about a half an inch. And then (whoosh) disappear and then swing back a second time, resetting on opposite sides of the hallway.

WILL: We all saw that, right?

MATT: You all saw that with a very (whoosh, whoosh).

LIAM: Scythes in the wall? My nose tickles right now. I'm going to attempt to take these out and– hold on.

LAURA: Can I perceive around and see if I see any switches or anything that would turn them off?

MATT: Make an investigation check.

LIAM: Thieves' tools to disarm, right?

MATT: Based on the check you previously made, these are a little more intricate and you're having a hard time finding a way to disarm them. This would be more of trying to find a mechanism in which to disarm them, which she is currently doing.

LAURA: This wouldn't be Underdark-y at all, would it?

MATT: No.

LAURA: Then I rolled a ten.

MATT: Well, this is an investigation check.

LIAM: Investigation? All right.

MATT: Ten? You have no idea of the nature of these.

LIAM: 13.

MATT: From this perspective, you have no inkling or idea as to what the mechanism is, where it's hidden, if there is a way to be able to disable the trigger. You have not encountered this before, and it is a little beyond your expertise at the moment.

LIAM: Grog, there's giant scythes in the wall or something and I can't figure out how to take it apart. Do you have a weapon that you could jam in this fucker? Like a throwaway weapon that you don't care about?

TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got three greatswords that are shit.

LIAM: Do you want to fucking fuck this knife hole with a sword?

SAM: On Vex's suggestion, I'm going to make an investigation check. 30.

MATT: So, while you guys are having this conversation. Scanlan, you step directly up to the very edge of where these blades swing from.

SAM: Kashaw. Watch this.

(laughter)

MARY: I think someone has a crush!

MATT: And you notice that, just glancing ever so slightly on the inside, there is some sort of a latch that is guarded by the blade's embedded portion. You realize as you put your hand forward, you trigger some sort of arcane sensor that is part of this that causes the blades to (whoosh) swing back, and as they swing past you, you hear a click on the inside of the groove that they swing from, and then as they swing a second time to reset, it gives a louder click sound, almost like it resets itself.

SAM: And how long a period from the blade swinging, to swinging back. Like a half a second?

MATT: It's about a second. It's (whoosh, whoosh).

SAM: So someone needs to reach their little hand in there and click it.

LAURA: Someone with little gnome hands, maybe.

WILL: Impress me.

SAM: Shit!

(laughter)

SAM: All right, watch this, y'alls. I'm going to try to do it.

TALIESIN: We get two tries each. It'll be great.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Scanlan, would you like a little bit of– enhancement?

SAM: Enhancement?

MARISHA: Natural enhancement, of course.

SAM: Ooh, I will never say no to enhancement.

MARISHA: I reach over and I enhance– what are you probably going to be using, dexterity?

SAM: I guess a little shortsword-y blade, I guess, to get in there? Or I have–

MARISHA: Is this going to be a sleight of hand check?

SAM: I have climbing gear, I have a cube. I have a flute. What can fit in there?

MATT: It's about two inches wide, the gap.

LAURA: So it's wide enough for your fingers.

MARISHA: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability and give him Cat's Grace for his dexterity checks.

MATT: Okay, so you have advantage on dexterity-based ability checks, currently.

SAM: Come on. I need these babies to play.

MARISHA: Don't lose your hand, Scanlan. We don't have Pike to regenerate it right now.

SAM: Do you have any tools I can borrow?

TALIESIN: I have a sword.

SAM: That shitty sword that you don't care about?

TALIESIN: It's a very nice sword that I care about quite a bit.

SAM: Could I shove a blade in there and jam it, maybe?

MATT: You can try to.

WILL: That's never a good answer. (laughs) You can try.

SAM: I'm going to use my Aberration Bane sword. Shortsword, or whatever it is. I have never used it.

MARY: (muffled) Don't use that sword. What are you thinking?

SAM: All right, I'm going to jam it in there.

MATT: Are you going to do it?

SAM: Sure.

MATT: All right, so you reach over and trigger the blades, pulling back immediately. (fwoof) They pass back. In that one moment, you go for it. Make a straight dexterity ability check, so roll a d20. You have advantage on it.

SAM: Okay, plus my dexterity, which is zero. So that's 13.

MARISHA: Dear god.

MATT: Once you understand the nature of this, it's not a very difficult thing to find. You bring the blade around in that brief moment, and as you bring your head into view to inspect the inside, you can see there is a slight stone protrusion from within that groove. You realize the blade probably isn't going to help at this point. You reach over and just (tkch).

SAM: With my finger?

MATT: You hit it with your fingers. As you do, you look quickly over to your right, and the blade is already pulling back towards the area where your head is, and then (creak, crunch) halts, and now the blades are just hanging.

(relieved noises)

MATT: Locked in place, as the arcane nature of this trap has held them aloft.

MARY: That was hot. That was very hot.

MARISHA: What was your first roll?

SAM: Thank you. Five.

MATT: (laughing) That would have been very bad.

SAM: Thank you for the advantage, Keyleth.

WILL: That was impressive. If it weren't for Vax, you'd be my man.

SAM: (laughing) Oh, Kashaw, you sweet-talker.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I'm in the middle of this.

SAM: Don't worry, everyone! I've cleared the way.

LAURA: I pat his little head as I walk through the blades. Not his cube. Just the top of his head.

(laughter)

MATT: So, as you guys continue forward down this long hallway, heading at a slight upward angle now, going against the tilt of this temple. Who's leading? All right. Pushing forward, it continues for about 60 feet. There was a tunnel split over to the right side, but that has entirely collapsed and is just filled with stone and it spills out partially into the hallway, but it's easy to step over and get past. Eventually–

LIAM: Are you saying it's not blocked, it's just some rubble and you can step over it?

MATT: Meaning the passage that you're walking down, it looks like there was a path that went to the right. That whole thing collapsed inward and is completely impassable.

LIAM: It's pooped into the passage.

MATT: It has spilled into the passage, but it's nothing you can't traverse over.

LIAM: Thank you.

WILL: Wow, you paint with words.

MATT: His vernacular is impressive.

LIAM: This is my profession.

(laughter)

WILL: “It pooped into the passage.”

MATT: Pushing even further forward, the passageway begins to curve gradually to the left over about 20 feet, and disappearing around a corner. As you continue to push forward here, you have moved beyond the light, unless Zahra, are you keeping the same essence of light here to help with his vision, you would have to travel up with him to be able to see around the corner as you move.

LIAM: Vex, could you tell Zahra to come up another 20 feet or so?

MARY: Coming. Coming now. So I go up and I stand next to him.

LAURA: Walk quietly, dear.

MATT: As you continue to move forward with him, the light cascading further down the hall, eventually the curvature comes to a halt and you can see before you a T-intersection of the tunnel. Across the way, the tunnel directly across from you comes to a halt. It just ends about 20 feet beyond this intersection. There is a path to the right and the left. Make a perception check.

LIAM: 22.

MATT: Okay. You can see, in a similar fashion to the tunnel you and Grog first discovered, the floor that is the center of this T-intersection has completely fallen out, as well. There are sections of stone that jut out from the edges, but it appears that this intersection for about a ten by ten foot area of the floor is just completely bottomed out.

LIAM: So I had a fucked-up passage on the right behind me. I've got a T ahead of me that goes in two directions, but there's a hole in the middle of the T.

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: And there's nothing else?

MATT: Nothing else visible in the area.

WILL: How far are they sticking out from the stone walls?

MATT: You aren't with them.

WILL: Oh. That's a good point.

LIAM: I back up against Zahra, and I say to everyone else, because she's right next to me, we've got a T in the passage here, but there's a big fucking hole in the way, so we're going to need to use our neverending rope, perhaps, or some means of getting over this hole if we want to go forward.

TALIESIN: Or into the hole. Maybe it goes further down.

MARY: I could use my cloak and I could fly.

LAURA: You have a– wait.

MARY: I have a Cloak of the Bat. And I can use mine to investigate left or right, whichever side you'd like, and I can do a quick investigation and come back and see.

LAURA: You can fly?

MARY: I can. I can also cast flight on all of us, but that would– I think, at this point, it might be best to do a single investigation.

LIAM: How strong are you?

MARY: (laughing) I'm terribly not strong at all. No, but I can get in and get out.

LIAM: Can't carry any one person over? Maybe a gnome?

LAURA: I could maybe try to leap from the sides of the hole or something.

MATT: Where it meets this center area, it's only about a five-foot step over.

LAURA and LIAM: Oh.

MATT: To the other parts of the intersection.

LAURA: I could totally parkour that.

MATT: As long as you're not going directly across. If you're just going catty-corner, it would be a relatively easy acrobatics check. Barring you don't roll a one.

LIAM: Hold on, I've got this figured out. Hold on. Hold on, shush. Eenie, meany, miney, mo. Catch a tiger by the toe–

MARY: Do you want to go left, I'll go right?

LAURA: (whispering) I think we should go down.

LIAM: Eenie, meany, miney, mo. We go rightwards.

LAURA: Can we look down? Can we just look down?

MARY: Does my darkvision extend at all 60 feet down into the hole to see what's there?

MATT: All right, as you guys approach, Vax deftly attempts to leap over to the right side of the T-junction. Make an acrobatics check.

LIAM: That's a 30-something. 30–

LAURA: Three.

MATT: Perfect two-toed landing. Just (ta-ding). And you are immediately met with… a wall. It ends to the right. It's almost like across the way and immediately to the right both just end abruptly.

LIAM: And there's nothing here?

MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

LIAM: 31.

MATT: You can see there are symbols burned into what looks to be some sort of a bird head that ends in these streaks that are carved into the rock. Intricately, and done with a very careful hand.

LIAM: (groans) There's a bunch of bullshit on this wall and a raven's head, and I don't know what any of it fucking means.

MARY: I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly over and to read it.

SAM: Wait, you can read bullshit?

MARY: I can read bullshit. I have–

TALIESIN: Oh, I read bullshit.

MARY: Eyes of the Runekeeper.

MATT: Okay. It's not a language. It is a symbol. But you can make a religion check.

WILL: Are we up there with them now?

MATT: You guys have stepped up to the edge of the tunnel.

LAURA: That little ledge won't support– I mean, is it a long hallway that ends abruptly, or is it this much space?

MATT: It's maybe ten, 15 feet beyond the break.

MARY: 20.

MATT: 20. This being a tomb of a champion of the Raven Queen, looking at this, you gather this is the symbol of the Raven Queen.

MARY: That's the symbol of the Raven Queen.

SAM: Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

LAURA: I drop something down into– a rock that I find– and drop it down into the hole.

(long pause)

MATT: (sploosh)

LAURA: It's pretty deep, guys.

LIAM: What do I hear if I knock on the wall that we're looking at?

MATT: (quiet knocking) Solid stone.

LIAM: Doesn't feel hollow.

LAURA: Can I, since it's only five feet away on the left, can I look around and see if it looks like there's any similar sort of traps or anything down that hallway?

MATT: Okay, so you get around and glance around the edge? To the left tunnel, there is no wall. Instead, you're met with a large, ten foot tall, eight to ten foot wide double set of doors.

SAM: Doors.

LIAM: We should just leave.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I'm going to hop over to where the doors are.

LAURA: I hop over to the doors, too.

MATT: Okay. Both of you guys make acrobatics checks.

SAM: Jesus, don't fall. (high-pitched noise)

TALIESIN: 13. 14.

LAURA: 31.

MATT: Okay. Yeah, you guys make it across fine.

MARY: Can I just fly over and land?

MATT: Kima's getting impatient, and she joins you guys across that way. She's fine on her roll.

MARISHA: Yeah, I'll jump over towards the doors as well.

MATT: Okay. Acrobatics check.

WILL: Me, too.

MARISHA: Oh, yeah. I rolled an 18.

WILL: Yeah, 20.

SAM: 15.

TRAVIS: I rolled a one.

ALL: No!

MARISHA: What?

MATT: So, as all of you start leaping across into this small tunnel right before the doors, taking a moment to inspect it, the final member of the group right before Trinket, who rolled a two–

LAURA: You rolled for Trinket?

MATT: Yeah. Don't worry, Trinket's fine. The one was the killer.

LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god.

MATT: So, you hear a (yelp) as suddenly, that slime-like mass that you've seen appearing throughout the stonework here has also gathered itself along the edge of this open crevasse in the hallway. Your foot hits it and within a moment, the stones beneath your feet are beneath your feet no more, and you find yourself about to plummet into this–

LAURA: Can I leap forward and try to grab him?

MATT: This is happening very quickly. I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to see if you can manage to catch the edge.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: 17? Actually, no, because there is slime on this, I need you to make it a roll with disadvantage.

MARISHA: Oh no.

TRAVIS: 11?

MATT: 11. You (grunts) just catch yourself on the edge. Your fingers are (shh) sliding off the edge right now. You're barely holding on.

MARISHA: I turn and I cast Grasping Vine from up here and try and yank him back up.

LAURA: Trinket turns and puts his claws into Grog's hand.

LIAM: Smart bear.

MATT: Okay. So in a very Scar in The Lion King moment (whoosh)–

(laughter)

TRAVIS: (yells) Just drop me!

MATT: You do take four points of slashing damage from the claws that dig into your hands as Trinket is holding onto you there. Then a vine streaks out from the stonework, wraps around you, and pulls you up out of Trinket's grasp, slamming into the ceiling and now holding you aloft before it drops you, plopping right into the stonework between the rest of the party.

MARISHA: Good to join us, Grog.

TRAVIS: Yeah, no big deal.

LAURA: Good to know you can jump at all.

MARY: Yes, how'd that work for you?

TRAVIS: Listen, an example of what not to do.

LAURA: Are your hands okay?

TRAVIS: Yeah. Should we proceed? What is all this dilly-dally?

LAURA: Are the doors locked?

MATT: You go ahead and push on the door?

LIAM: Wait! What are you doing over there?

LAURA: Are there traps on the door? I check for traps.

LIAM: Wait up– okay, go for it.

MATT: Make an investigation check.

LIAM: Do me proud!

LAURA: 16.

MATT: Okay. Looking over it, there is what looks to be a locking mechanism on it, but it is not currently locked.

LIAM: Well, that was lucky.

TALIESIN: Is it?

LAURA: (door squeaking sound) I push?

MATT: You push? (thump) It doesn't budge. You have to put some of your weight behind it to get it to shift at all, and it (creak) opens up slightly into a pitch-black room ahead of you.

LAURA: Oh good, more darkness.

MARY: I peek in and, using my darkvision, see what I can see for 60 feet.

MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

LIAM: I'm going to catch up with the ladies and acrobatics over to them.

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: 20– 33, excuse me.

MATT: Yeah. Yeah, you (impact). Around the edge–

MARY: Balls– ten.

MATT: Ten? It's hard to make out much detail in the room; you can see what appears– the room just lays out before you. It seems to open up slightly, and then even further partway in. It ends on the opposite side with curved corners. You can see what appears to be four pillars in the room that meet the floor to the ceiling, the ceiling which is about 25 feet tall. Most of the tunnels you've passed through here are about 15 to 20: this is about 25 feet tall at its full height. But these pillars reach to the ceiling, and there are steps across the way, what appears to be a raised platform. That's the most detail you can make out of it at this distance– you'd have to get close.

MARY: Can't see much. It's a taller ceiling, there seems to be a platform in the middle and some pillars.

LAURA: Like a platform like a tomb?

MARY: No, I can't see, really.

MARISHA: Like an altar?

MARY: It's a slightly raised platform, that's– Grog, can you help? Can you do anything, can you see any further than me?

TRAVIS: Yeah, I come over, and– 'cause I have 60 feet of darkvision. Can I try?

MATT: Yeah, make a Perception check.

TRAVIS: Nah, I can't see shit.

SAM: All right, I'll look. I've also got darkvision, so– 12.

MATT: All right, you all come to the same conclusion– some sort of raised platform across the way.

MARY: Right, it's sort of a platform, but you can't really tell what it is.

SAM: Sort of curved to the back– I could probably sketch it for you.

LAURA: Can I stealth? I want to stealth. And perceive– I'm going to, like, step in.

SAM: Oh, let's just go in there.

LIAM: Wait a second, hold on a second, this is the only thing we can do.

LAURA: 20.

LIAM: 25.

MATT: Okay, so you guys stealth into the room. You sneak in, and you can see now, this slime-type substance that you've seen throughout–

LAURA: Oh! 30, because of Pass without a Trace, which is still on us.

LIAM: 30, 35.

MATT: All right– it seems to coat most of the floor and walls of this interior. You guys step inside, and with what little bit of light you have, you see a couple shapes shift across the way, behind the platform.

MARY: That's not good.

LIAM: (whispers) All right, everybody, get ready to play.

TRAVIS: What? Play?

LAURA: (whispers) There's definitely creatures in here. I don't know if they're hostile.

LIAM: I reach down– are there any rocks or pebbles or anything on the ground?

MATT: You find a couple of small pebbles.

LAURA: (whispers) Can I just shoot an arrow?

LIAM: I take a pebble, I throw it all the way towards the platform.

TRAVIS: Don't waste an arrow.

MATT: Okay. (plop, plop, plop) As you listen, you hear a couple of hushed voices (Undercommon). Do either of you speak Undercommon?

LAURA: I do.

MATT: You do.

MARY: They're jawas.

ALL: Ooh!

MARISHA: Secrets, secrets, secrets.

SAM: Check out the Geek and Sundry store for fantastic Critical Role-themed products and merchandise! There are shirts and posters for sale!

LAURA: (gasps) Ohh! I forgot! Wait! (gasps) Shh!

LIAM: What's the matter? (whispers) What's the matter?

LAURA: (whispers) They know we're here. Obviously, you threw a fucking rock. They want to fight us– whatever it is they're protecting– this champion's–

SAM: They want to bite us?

TRAVIS: I don't know if anyone can hear you when you're whispering.

LAURA: You want me to just yell it out?

WILL: Well, if they know we're here–

LAURA: Cool. Hey, there's people on the other fucking side, and they're going to attack us when we walk in here. They're saying to defend his fucking tomb.

SAM and WILL: Oh.

WILL: Right place.

MARY: So they've been in the dark for a long time, is that right? I'm going to cast some light as bright as I possibly can.

LAURA: I'm stealthing to the side.

LIAM: Stealthing to the side.

WILL: Kashaw jumps up with Zahra; they cast Light at the same time.

MATT: Light spell is about as powerful as decent torchlight, it doesn't become crazy, you know, Gandalf-Bridge-of-Khazad-Dum-style.

WILL: (Gandalf voice) You shall not pass!

MATT: Yeah. But it does light up the room, and from what you can see now, immediately across the way, atop this platform there is what looks to be another stone, raised platform or what could be considered as some sort of a tomb or stone coffin that lays atop these stairs on this upper platform. There is another humanoid figure that stands on top, that turns around at the light and you can see the light giving that weird, ominous animal eye-glow whenever the light catches it at an awkward angle, the fish face snarling at you, robes drenched in various liquid and mucus-y fluid swish around for a minute as it turns to you, this fish humanoid clutching this big staff. You can see now three other of these fish-like entities all clamor up from the side, holding onto these spears and these weird buckler-type shields on the side of their arms, and they just (loud Undercommon).

LAURA and MARY: What'd he say?

LAURA: I want to get up and meet him at a–

SAM: You can also make donations to our charities of choice– Find links to those on Geek and Sundry.

LAURA: I use my earring and I whisper, they're calling to their master! Something big. I stay stealthed.

MATT: All right. The rest of you–

MARISHA: Oh, shit–

LIAM: Stealth, stealth, stealth, stealth, stealth!

MATT: Right, we have two of you have stealthed inside, and you've rolled stealth for this?

LAURA: Rolled stealth?

MARY: And we still all have Pass without a Trace on us?

LAURA: Yeah, everybody still has Pass Without a Trace.

LIAM: Is this new stealth?

MATT: It doesn't matter, there's two big light sources in the front of the door. This is going to be an initiative roll, folks.

TALIESIN: Yeah.

WILL: Look, there's the broken floor!

MARY: Oh, it's so pretty! There are the pillars!

SAM: Oh, wow, the detail!

MATT: Thank you, Dwarven Forge.

LIAM: Who was this made by?

MATT: Dwarven Forge, folks.

MARY and LIAM: Dwarven Forge.

TALIESIN: That's awesome.

MATT: All right, so. This door here has been opened for the moment. The folks that were still back in this tunnel here– We have Zahra and Kash that walked in and created the light, Trinket is still back here at this point– Scanlan, you're at the edge of the door, Percy– And we have Kima in the back there, holding up the range. Across the way we have the one robed individual and these other frog-type creatures that have stepped out from behind here. All righty. So. Let's go ahead and get some initiative rolls, folks.

LAURA: Was I supposed to roll stealth at all on that?

MATT: Yeah, if you rolled–

LAURA: 35.

MATT: 35.

WILL: Ew. Do you add it to anything?

TALIESIN: Yeah, you have an initiative number.

LIAM: 29 for something.

SAM: Ooh!

MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20.

LAURA: 21.

MATT: 21. All right.

MATT: 20 to 15?

WILL: 19.

LIAM: 19.

MATT: Nice.

TRAVIS: Oh, 17. And 17.

SAM: 17 for Scanlan.

MATT: So Grog is 17, Scanlan is 17.

LIAM: 19 for Vax.

MATT: Yes, 19 for Vax.

LIAM: Okay.

MATT: What'd you roll, five?

LAURA: Uh huh– nine, ten–

MATT: Okay, so that's15 to ten?

TALIESIN: 12.

MATT: Percy. Ten to five?

MARY: (singing along with battle music) Fiiiiive. (higher) Fiiiiiiiiive!

MARISHA: Just me and Grog.

MATT: All right. Keyleth, what'd you get?

MARISHA: Four.

MATT: Four.

MARISHA: Four, yeah! Lucky number four.

MATT: Oh, man. Kima rolled really bad, too.

MARY: Kima, you're very quiet.

MATT: You have nine people in your traveling group, plus a bear. Trying not to over-complicate this. You mass-traveling assholes.

LIAM: She's very focused and studying our styles.

MATT: Exactly. All right. All right, so, Vex, you have the top of the round.

LAURA: Awesome. I'm going to– ooh! Is this Sneak Attack, because I'm stealthed?

MATT: Technically you would Sneak Attack if you hit somebody who has not– you don't know if they've seen you or not.

LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on the guy in the middle, 'cause everything within ten feet is hit. Oh, you know what? I was using those little blocks as feet marks– is that?

MATT: Yeah, I mean, these are five feet each, so it would get those two there if you were to do it.

SAM: Is there light? Oh, they lit torches, right?

LAURA: It wouldn't get the two guys down–

MATT: It would get these two there; this guy is actually beyond the ten-foot radius if you were to hit the middle guy.

LAURA: Okay. So let's do the middle guy and– yeah.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Aw man, which one, which one?

MATT: Go for it.

LAURA: Let's do this– That's 30? 30.

MATT: 30 hits–

LAURA: No, 28.

MATT: Pass without a Trace now drops, by the way. All right, so go ahead and roll damage against that guy.

LAURA: Lightning Arrow is 4d8 lightning damage.

MATT: Correct. So go ahead and roll that for the main guy.

LAURA: Okay. 27 plus sneak attack?

MATT: Correct.

LAURA: 29.

MATT: 29 points of damage. Fantastic, and then it is 2d8 against the other two if they do not make their dexterity saving throw. So what's the DC on the spell? Well, that's a natural 20–

LAURA: 15.

MATT: One of them succeeds, one of them fails.

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: So roll 2d8.

LAURA: 13.

MATT: This one takes 13 damage, the other takes six. Okay. So as you step out of the shadows, pull back your arrow and release this bolt of blue lightning energy, it fires across, slams into this robed fish-person who shrieks out in pain. The bolts then scatter off and shoot into two of the nearby ones. One of them manages to pull right behind the pillar and manage to avoid most of the impact. The one over here, however, takes the brunt of it and doubles over in pain, almost falling onto its knees. They start croaking back to each other.

LAURA: I'm going to move–

MATT: Do you wish to move yourself or Trinket?

LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to move behind that wall there.

MATT: Right here?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: All right. And Trinket, you want to move–

LAURA: Trinket is going to–

MATT: Don't forget you have your pointers, guys.

LAURA: Move– I don't know where that is– move behind the pillar. Can he get there?

MATT: His movement speed is 40?

LAURA: Maybe? Yes.

MATT: You get there, yeah.

LAURA: Yeah. Cool.

MATT: All right. That brings us to Vax.

LIAM: I dunno if this laser pointer's going to work, since there's now a wall in the way. I'm going to go up the side– I'm going to hit my heel against the other heel–

TRAVIS: I love that you're pointing it at the TV.

LIAM: Yeah, that's great.

(laughter)

LIAM: I'm going to go right to that window right there.

MATT: Right here?

LIAM: Yeah. And you tell me if it's surprise, I don't know, but I'm going before Fish Guy up on the dais. I can't make it work over these walls. I'm going to chuck three daggers at Fish Guy up here on the dais. Through the window.

MATT: It's not a surprise because they were aware that there was an aggressive action coming in. But you still–

LIAM: But because I go first I get advantage on all attacks.

MATT: Correct, so. So it's three against this guy?

LIAM: Against guy on the dais, yeah. Is 28?

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: Second one is 14, and the third one is 27.

MATT: All three hit.

LIAM: All three hit, so the first one we'll do a sneak attack on, and here we go.

LAURA: No sneak attack.

LIAM: Oh, sorry. Advantage. Thank you. 11 for the first, ten for the second, and eight for the third.

MATT: This includes sneak attack damage?

LAURA: I thought you said it didn't get sneak attack–

MATT: You have advantage, no no no– You don't have surprise.

LIAM: Right, but because I have advantage, I automatically– So yes! Sneak attack on the first– The first one was–

MATT: It was ten plus whatever the dice roll is.

LIAM: I rolled a full four, so that's four plus eight plus– That's 13, 19, 24, 28, 32, 34–

LAURA: That's better.

LIAM: That's the dice, 34, so 68 plus seven is 75.

MATT: 68?

LIAM: You double the dice, yeah?

MATT: If it's a surprise, you– okay.

LIAM: Sneak Attack, sorry, I always get this fucking shit confused. Sorry. So half of that is, so 34 plus seven is 41.

MATT: 41 points of damage.

LIAM: Always get it confused. Every fucking time.

MATT: It's all good. So, after the energy from the arrow is still dissipating from the blast, you've already rushed behind through the small space in the wall and thrown all three daggers, all sinking into the body of the robed frog creature, who doubles over from pain, slamming into the top of the stone sarcophagus. In doing so, its hand hits it and a bunch of black feathers scatter off the top and come to rest on the ground at the bottom of the raised platform. Does that end your turn?

LIAM: I'd like to use the rest of my movement just to sink down with my back against the wall, out of the way of the window.

MATT: Okay, so that should be there. All right, that ends your turn. Kashaw.

WILL: Okay. How far away are they?

MATT: They're about 45-ish, 40 to 45 feet.

LIAM: 50 from whoever's in the lead.

WILL: I think I'm going to do a– how close are the three together? Or, there's four, right?

MATT: There's four of them, yeah.

WILL: So those– how close are the three to the top there, I don't have a laser pointer.

MATT: Here? I mean they're all within ten feet of each other. Ten to 15 feet.

WILL: I think I am going to do a 5th-level Flame Strike.

SAM: Whoa.

WILL: On– if they're within ten feet, I can hit all three of those guys right there.

MATT: All right, Dexterity saves: fail, fail and fail. Go ahead and roll some damage.

WILL: So it's a 20, right?

MATT: No, you already hit with them, sorry– I take that back. You just do straight damage to them, and they don't get any reduction in that because they missed their saves, so you just roll the dice and that's how much damage they take.

WILL: And is it a 20?

MATT: No, it's 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage, so 8d6 total.

SAM: You got it.

WILL: Ah, come on.

MARISHA: Whoa, that's good!

WILL: Okay, six, ten, 14, 16, 19, 23, 24.

MATT: Okay. So.

WILL: Thank you.

MATT: Are you going to stay where you are or are you moving in?

WILL: No, I'd like to then move in, closer to Trinket.

MATT: Okay. So as you're moving by, you grab onto your holy symbol, look over and concentrate. Your eyes go dark black, and one of the feathers that drifted off the top of the platform comes to rest on the ground between the three of them. As the feather hits the ground it creates this opening of blackness behind them as they look down. All of a sudden the darkness turns to bright, searing light as fire and divine energy just slams up from the ground beneath them into the ceiling, and you just hear these three simultaneous screeches. As the flames die down, there is nothing left where they were standing.

(cheering)

MARY: Yes, my brother!

MATT: All right. And that ends your turn. He doesn't have a turn anymore. At this point in time–

WILL: I'm sensing something big is on the way

SAM: Vax! Did you see that?

LIAM: I'm under cover, I'm pressed to a wall. I saw a flash of something.

SAM: Amazing! Oh, sorry, I won't draw attention to it.

MATT: There is this echoing mutter, this almost burbling that seems to rise up behind Kima and Percy at this point.

SAM: Oh, shit.

MATT: You glance over your shoulder into the darkness below the collapsed tunnel, and what little bit of light you see coming through, you see something fleshy rise up from underneath. It's glistening in places and immediately a cold shudder crawls down your back as you see a series of appendages release, each with a gleaming eye at the end of each one.

LAURA: (gasps) No.

MATT: As one giant eye rises up, it–

ALL: No!

(yelling)

MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

TALIESIN: No!

MARISHA: We weren't prepared!

TALIESIN: Not cool.

TRAVIS: Happy anniversary, you dicks.

(laughter)

LAURA: (muffled) Oh my god!

MATT: As it rises up and Kima looks over the shoulder– “Shit!” It's going to be a beam at Kima, a beam at you Percy, and a beam at Grog since you're visible.

WILL: (laughs) Shit just got real! And we're all just, we're stuck in the room now.

MATT: Against Percy, I need you to make a dexterity save.

LIAM: Wake up, everybody!

TRAVIS: What's going against him right now?

LAURA: You!

TALIESIN: That's 19.

MATT: A 19, okay. Great. A dull green beam arcs past, and you manage to just duck out of the way– Slams into the stone wall next to you, of which that stone wall now just turns to dust. Disintegrated rock behind you. The one against Kima, see if she makes her save here– No, she fails. This beam hits Kima square in the chest, and as it does she doesn't seem to have any physical reaction but she begins to back up instinctually from it. You can see her jaw agape, her eyes wide open, she looks like she is filled with the dread of the ages. And the third beam going towards Grog, have to reroll that, need you to make a dexterity save, Grog.

TRAVIS: I'm not raging or anything. 19.

MATT: 19, great. A strangely quicksilver-like beam strikes you center in the chest. It hits you and you feel the muscles around your chest begin to seize up and crack into dust like the actual flesh is turning to a slightly hardened stone but you flex and resist the effect, the petrification not beginning to take hold within your body.

TRAVIS: Petrification–

LAURA: I don't remember all the things, I don't remember all the things! Oh no!

MARISHA: It's everything– Yeah, they've got fear, disintegration–

TALIESIN: It is the burrito supreme of creatures. It comes with everything!

WILL: And fries and a coke!

TALIESIN: There's a fuck-you beam too, there's like literally a fuck-you beam

WILL: Oh my god, you're going into a special section of your book. That's never good.

MARISHA: I've got a list, I've got a fiends book.

WILL: Oh my god, of course you do.

LIAM: Ah, he's moving!

MATT: So as it turns up, its beam striking you, after all the beams hit, it turns around and (incomprehensible growling). Speaking in a language you don't understand unless one of you speaks Deep Speech.

SAM: Deep Speech? I speak Common!

WILL: Yeah, is that the same as Giant?

SAM: And Gnomish!

TRAVIS: Is that above us or is that?

MATT: He's right above you, he's just hovering right over your heads. And it stops right above you, Grog. That ends its turn.

TRAVIS: Don't you fucking shoot that shit at me! And I go into a frenzied rage! And I will– I'm going to just attack it regular, with Craven Edge. Just on this one, 'cause I don't know what hits yet.

MATT: You get two attacks.

TRAVIS: Yep. Terrible. 12.

MATT: 12. You go to swing and you miss entirely.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: You swing with a 17 and once again, just in your fury and anger in it flying overhead and the little bit of intensity of its reveal, you just can't seem to find purchase on its body.

TRAVIS: 17 does not hit, FYI.

LAURA: Got it, got it, got it.

MATT: All right, Grog, you want to move or you going to stay where you are?

TRAVIS: I am going to move like the sweet dewdrop that I am, and haul ass behind– I've got a little pointer. I'm going to move behind that column.

MATT: Okay, you can get there fine.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Just put it between me and him. That'll end my turn.

MATT: Okay. As you rush past, it's going to go ahead and use a reaction to make a bite attack at you as you speed beneath it. Oh, that is a 24 to hit.

TRAVIS: That hits.

MATT: You take 14 points of piercing damage, reduced to seven. As its teeth just reach out and bite towards you, streaking across your shoulder as you push out of the pain, continuing forward. All right, that ends Grog's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Jesus. Can it see me? I'm right under it.

MATT: It doesn't seem to notice you at the moment, no.

SAM: Okay.

MATT: It seems to be intent, looking towards Zahra and Kashaw at the moment, as they are immediately in front of it.

SAM: I'm going to attempt to use my Wand of Fire– oh no, no, that's a bad idea. I'm going to use my Lightning Bolt! Lightning Bolt on it. Lightning Bolt. 'Cause I'm right under it, right? So it'll just go straight up.

MATT: You are, correct. Ah, it fails its save. That's an 11.

SAM: Okay. So I can roll for something?

MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll 8d6 points of lightning damage against it, because you're doing it at a level three?

SAM: Yes, please.

MATT: So yeah, so 8d6 lightning damage.

TALIESIN: That's really good.

SAM: 30!

MATT: 30 points of damage. Nice! So as you release this bolt of energy, you guys see this flash of blue light in the distance as the bolt slams up into the creature from underneath. All its eyes whip around in your direction for a second, before looking around all the areas around it. It's still focused intently in your guys' direction. Do you wish to move or do you want to stay where you are?

SAM: Well, I assume it sees me now, but I'll slowly back away.

MATT: Okay, Percy's in your way so you have to back over in this direction.

SAM: Does it kill me while I move?

MATT: No, it's already made its reaction.

SAM: And then I will turn to Zahra and I will sing to her to inspire her. I'll sing: (sings) Zahra, a rainbow! Zahra, a sunrise! Zahra the moon to wear! That's not good enough, no, not good enough, not for Zahra!

(laughter)

MATT: Okay, you take a d10 inspiration die, so keep that on hand.

LIAM: I always like the bail out at the end.

MATT: It's the best. All right, that ends your turn. Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: Oh boy! First thing I'm going to do– So it took its reaction, so does that mean if I run around it, it can't take an attack of opportunity on me or is–

MATT: Correct, yes. If you wanted to move past it, yes, you could.

TALIESIN: I'm going to try and run past it, full speed, yeah.

MATT: There you go, that's about as far as you can get in a direct line.

TALIESIN: Okay, that will do. I'm going to– What's the smart play here?

MATT: Keep it going, Percy, what are you going to do?

TALIESIN: Yeah, sorry, I'm going to cast Hex on the little fish creature. I know that sounds odd, but that's what I'm doing.

MATT: Actually, Lewis, can you hand me that little template there? The post. To the left of it.

(offscreen clatter)

SAM: That worked.

(laughter)

MATT: So, Percy, as you go to cast the spell, you release the incantation. Nothing happens.

TALIESIN: That's fine. I'm going to take a trick shot at the beholder.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: So I'm going to shoot for the head, that tends to go well. Oh, thank god. No, that's going to miss. That's a 15.

MATT: 15. Unfortunately, in your sudden fear of realizing the spell not happening, you go to fire and it just ricochets off the stone.

TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take another shot. Same thing. Headshot.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: That's a little better. 20

MATT: 20 does hit.

TALIESIN: 20 hits, so that's– God damn it, I'm rolling really poorly. That's eight points of piercing damage. Plus he has to make a constitution save.

MATT: Okay, or?

TALIESIN: Or, if he missed his constitution save, that means he's disadvantage on attacks until the end of his turn.

MATT: Good to know. The rays don't make attacks so the only thing that it would affect is his bite.

TALIESIN: Okay. That's–

LAURA: Good to know.

MATT: It just looks at you and the ray hits you and it's your attempt to try to get out of the way. That's how it works.

TALIESIN: Good fucking god! Then just, I suppose, with my last attack I'm going to shoot that fish person, just 'cause we should really clear the board.

MATT: Okay, go for it.

TALIESIN: That's better! 20– 31.

MATT: 31, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) Eight.

MATT: Eight damage? So as you turn around the third shot fires, it slams into the fish creature. You see, like, blowing part of its neck out, it (choking grunt). It's pretty heavily hurt, but still standing. It looks to be almost like, with the pain it's withstanding as it's looking up at this, it's reverent and raising its spear toward the Beholder, like (Undercommon chanting).

LIAM: Four more years!

(laughter)

MATT: All right, that's Percy. It is now that creature's turn.

WILL: We're going to build a fish cage. Vasselheim's going to pay for it.

LIAM: It's going to be 'uge.

MARY: 'Uge. Tiny hands, 'uge.

MATT: All right, six. It's going to move up to you after you shot it. Percy, it's going to make an attack with its spear on you with both hands. It pulls up and goes towards you, its big old fish mouth snapping. Oh! That's going to be a 21?

TALIESIN: I'm going to take the hit.

MATT: Okay. As it jams the spear into your side, it hits your shoulder and just streaks off, tearing into the flesh a little bit, but it's not too bad. You end up taking– okay, that's nine points of piercing damage. All right! That ends its turn. Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Okay, first things first, I'm going to–

MATT: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your turn, out of frustration at being shot, it's going to use one of its action points to shoot– I'm sorry, one of its legendary actions to shoot another eye ray at random, at the end of Percy's turn.

MARISHA: Where's that laser pointer?

TALIESIN: It's going to shoot at me, isn't it?

MATT: Yes, it is going to shoot at you, because you were the one that just shot at it. No, it's not going to shoot you, because you are in its– it would absolve its ray, so it's not going to shoot you, it's going to fire behind it, instead, at Kima. Okay.

MARISHA: What? Come on–

MATT: Kima's strength save… Natural two. So that's going to be the telekinetic ray, it's going to move it 30 feet in any direction. It's going to lift Kima above this hole and just drop her. Kima, unable to do anything at this point, struck with fear from the previous ray and is nowhere near the edge, is just thrown off and plummets into the darkness below, where the beholder originally emerged. You just hear her scream (screams) as the echo continues past. You don't even hear an impact. That sucked.

MARY: Oh my god.

MATT: Now it's your turn, Keyleth.

MARISHA: Oh my god– do I still have enough time to do a bonus reaction to try and save her with a Grasping Vine, or is she gone?

MATT: I will say go ahead and roll a dexterity check. Just a straight dexterity check.

MARISHA: (groans) Straight dexterity?

MATT: As you look over–

MARISHA: I rolled a natural two.

MATT: –before you have an opportunity to get that thought in your head, she vanishes into the darkness.

SAM: (laughing nervously) Oh shit, Kima just died.

WILL: (laughing) Why are you laughing!? Holy shit!

TALIESIN: She may not be dead. She may just be really, really wet and broken.

MARY: She landed in the slime.

SAM: Yeah! Yeah, maybe it's soft and cushy!

MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth?

MARISHA: I'm going to try and move behind him so– I'm not, like, in his eye cone, am I?

MATT: Right now you're not, no. So you can move–

MARISHA: No no, behind him a bit– I'm going to cast Blight at fifth level on him.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: Oh, god. I'm so afraid. So it's going to do 9d8 damage– anyone give me some d8s? d8 me.

MATT: Okay, constitution saving throw–

MARISHA: Fail it, motherfucker.

MATT: 11, so yeah. Full damage.

MARISHA: Yeah! All right, okay. Eight, ten, 15, 17. So, four more. These were at 17– That could've been better. What'd I say, 17? Plus another seven, this is 33 damage.

MATT: 33 damage. Nice. So as you look up, you channel your spell energy into the essence of withering life force and you can see a portion of its back, the slime dripping from its form, the flesh shrinks up and shrivels, and it shrieks out. Some of the eyestalks quiver and look in the direction of where you are, and some glance down and see you.

MARISHA: So we established that this moss-slime isn't natural, it's not like a plant.

MATT: Correct.

MARISHA: And now I'm going to use my bonus action to go into earth elemental form.

MATT: Return to form.

MARISHA: Yes. This worked last time.

MARY: What does that mean, Keyleth?

TRAVIS: She turns into a giant rock monster.

MATT: That ends your turn. At the end of your turn it's going to use another legendary action to fire another ray. This one is going to be– this is going to be at Scanlan, as it's the one that's clear and behind it. It sees you transform into earth elemental form–

MARISHA: Do I still have enough movement to where I can, like, go underground? Can I do that, or no?

MATT: You can travel into earth. You cannot travel into, like, solid stone, carved stone.

MARISHA: Is there any earth around?

MATT: Not immediately visible. Actually, there is, in the wall that it disintegrated when it tried to shoot Percy, so yeah, right up in here there would be.

MARISHA: Can I, like, Homer Simpson (slurps) into the wall?

MATT: Okay. (slurps) You vanish into the wall there. But you can only emerge from that same spot.

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: It's the only exposed earth in the vicinity. But you are in the wall. Okay! It's going– and since you've disappeared, it goes ahead and takes the ray shot at Scanlan. Scanlan, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

SAM: Is this a spell?

MATT: No, this is not a spell.

SAM: Can I use Cutting Words on it?

MATT: It is not an actual attack–

SAM: Oh, it just happens.

MATT: But you can use Cutting Words to reduce the damage if you want to.

SAM: Well, then, I'll just make my what, dexterity sa–

MATT: Your dexterity save, yes.

SAM: Hmm, yeah, great. Five?

MATT: Five.

MARISHA: To be fair, I think I still have your Enhance Ability up–

MATT: Ability checks. Ability checks, not saving throws. So you can see one eyestalk that was looking for Keyleth hones in on you and this eye has no iris, just a deep, thick, black pupil. And a streaking beam, it sounds like a shrieking voice, just (shrieks) streaks out and slams into you, this black, solid beam. You take 55 points of necrotic damage.

LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god.

SAM: Yeah. Sure, sure, yeah. Yeah.

TALIESIN: I hate beholders so much.

MATT: That ends Keyleth's turn. Kima's turn.

LAURA: Is she unconscious or is she awake?

MATT: We're going to find out.

TALIESIN: She's possibly still falling, it could be a really deep hole.

WILL: She's like, 'Damn, this is taking forever.'

MATT: Does not make the acrobatics check–

LAURA: Oh no!

LIAM: Look at this guy, he's cold as the universe.

TALIESIN: Doing so much math.

MATT: Okay. You hear a distant echo of a slam of impact that seems like the breaking of water, along with the hitting of stone. You hear this distant, echoing (groans) “Ouch.”

LAURA: Okay, she's alive.

SAM: Wait, we hear her say something, I mean, she's not underwater drowning or anything.

MATT: Correct. The hit of water and stone sounds like wherever she landed, it was shallow enough to impact when she landed. But not enough for her to, like, sink or anywhere. But she is, right now, effectively out of this fight, ending her turn. Zahra, you're up.

MARY: All right, if I move to this tiny little alcove, right there. Can it see me?

MATT: You're not within its main eye, but it can see everything around it.

MARY: Then I'm going to Hex it? No, no, I'm going to use Witch Bolt.

MATT: All right. What level?

MARY: I'm a warlock, what level can I use it at?

MATT: Well, what level would it be? It would be your max level as a warlock.

MARY: I don't know, I'm sorry–

LAURA: Six. Seven.

MARY: Six. Seven was last week, and that doesn't count anymore!

WILL: No. You can't finger it to death!

MARY: I can't finger it to death and I want– wait, what?

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Wow.

MARY: Which is a plus 11 attack bonus, and then 5d12 plus two.

MATT: So you, yeah, correct. Well, technically it would be 6d12 if you're doing it at a sixth level.

MARY: Oh, 6d12.

MATT: Go ahead and roll to see if you hit first. You have to roll to– It'd be a d20, and add your ranged spell bonus.

MARY: What is my ranged spell attack bonus? Do you know that?

LAURA: Your ranged attack bonus? 11.

MARY: 11– and what is that? I think it's a nine. 20.

MATT: Okay, so you rolled a 20 total? That hits. Go ahead and roll 6d12 lightning damage.

LAURA: 6d12!? Holy crap, girl!

MARISHA: That's hot.

WILL: God, I can't get 'fingered to death' outta my head.

MARY: 24. Close. Better than the other ones.

MATT: 24?

MARY: 24 plus two.

MATT: Okay. So 26. All right, so the lightning blasts into its side. One of the nearest stalks just looks over at you to acknowledge the impact, and you just hear a slight snarl as the eye looks out of the corner towards you. Is that going to end your turn?

MARY: Mm-hmm.

MATT: Brings us to the top. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Okay. Am I– can it see me in its eye? Would I be in its thingy?

MATT: It is looking in your direction.

LAURA: I'm going to move stealthily along the wall so I can maybe be out of that thing. Can I be?

MATT: You don't know. We'll find out when you stop. To there? You would still be in the eye range.

LAURA: Fuckin' shit bitch.

LIAM: Only she can get away with that. None of the rest of us can.

LAURA: Am I hiding? Am I still hidden?

MATT: No, because you revealed yourself in the attack you did a little while ago. I mean, you can duck partially. If you want to use an action to try and hide you can do that.

LAURA: No, I don't want to do that, I just want to make my motion hide behind a pillar, maybe.

SAM: Oh, wait, remember, Laura, you can move a little bit faster because you have 30 gold less than you did earlier.

(laughter)

WILL: But she's weighed down by the book!

LAURA: Yeah, I appreciate it. My pouches are still pretty heavy. I'm going to hold my action until he's looking away from me. And I want to move Trinket behind the wall.

MATT: So Trinket moves behind the wall there, looking over at you, you can see noticeable fear in Trinket's face. All right, at the end of your turn it's going to use its third legendary action. It's going to take another eye roll– another eye beam. This one is going to fire at Grog.

(groaning)

MATT: Actually, no, not Grog. It can still see the pillar– no, Grog, because you're one of the few, like, big individuals in its front way that's not in its ray.

TRAVIS: Does the pillar grant me any cover at all?

MATT: Nope! We'll see what it does, though. All right, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

TRAVIS: 19?

MATT: 19.

TRAVIS: 20, actually. 11 plus nine is 20.

MATT: All right, cool. So, as a yellowish beam streaks across and slams into your back, you feel your back muscles tense up and lock up and you resist the effect once again. You just have that hardy constitution of a goliath who seems to be resisting every one of these beams that slams into you for the time being. Vax, it's your turn.

LIAM: I'm going to use Cunning Action to hide, and then I'm going to run along the back wall to the pillar by– across from Vex, at the back of the chamber. And if counting is right, I'm 60 feet away from the beholder.

MATT: You'd be just within 60 feet.

LIAM: Just within, right. That's what I thought, and I'm going to throw three daggers at his fuckin' eyeball.

MATT: Go for it. You used your bonus action to hide, so you get two attacks.

LIAM: Two attacks? But I got the hasted boots on. I clicked the heels.

MATT: Right. But you only have one attack with your main action.

LIAM: Oh, right! Thanks. And do I have advantage– no one's near him, right?

MATT: You have to roll a stealth check to see if he sees you or not.

LIAM: All right. Use my last Luck. No, that's okay because I'm me, so that is 25.

MATT: 25, okay. So go ahead and roll your attacks.

LIAM: All right, so the first attack was an eight– 18.

MATT: 18 hits. And you do have advantage on these because he does not see you.

LIAM: Okay. So the first attack was 18 plus– sorry, it was 30–

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: And the second attack was 28.

MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage, and sneak attack on the first hit because he did not see where you were. Surprisingly, being an entity covered in eyes.

LIAM: One plus two, five, ten, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20 for the first. No, 27.

MATT: Seven, yeah, all right, okay.

LIAM: And then the second attack is– ten.

MATT: Got it. 37. Rushing up behind the side, ducking into the shadows, you go around the pillar and– watch one dagger spin around and watch a second one. Both of them sinking into him. Adjusts in place angrily from the pain and impact, but– yeah.

LIAM: I also make a little, like, raspberry noise at the end and go (pffbt).

MATT: Cool. That's what breaks your stealth. Not the attacks, strangely. Okay. That ends your turn. Kashaw, you're up.

WILL: I know, but if he's looking right at me– I mean, he can see me, essentially, looking right at me, correct?

MATT: Everything else except for you and Percy are directly out of the main eye, but his eyestalks look all over the entire room and they keep shifting and taking in the awareness of the surroundings. But the big eye is just staring right at you intently.

WILL: Can I get out of the direct– well, can you cast magic against the big eye or no?

MATT: You don't know.

WILL: So should we give it a shot? See, that's the thing, is he's staring right at me.

MARISHA: You could move out of it.

WILL: First thing we want to do is run away. Can we get out of the range of the eye somehow?

MATT: Possibly. You have not encountered a beholder in your time. Go ahead and roll an intelligence check.

WILL: God, it's ironic that I don't even know how to do that.

MATT: Just modifier.

MARISHA: Plus two.

WILL: Yeah. So 12.

MATT: Do what you want to do!

WILL: Thanks for that! How far away can I get?

MATT: I mean, you can move six squares. 30 feet, so.

WILL: Two, three. I want to get away from the eye. Can we move to behind that wall? Is that possible?

MATT: Yup.

WILL: And then, I still can see him, though, but he can look at me, and I'm just going to be wasting stuff if he– So I'm going to hold my action until he's not staring right at me. Can we do that?

MATT: Sure.

WILL: There's not much I can do. Yeah. So that's what I'm going to do. Going to run away.

MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. It is now the beholder's turn. The beholder is going to float up towards the ceiling of the area–

LIAM: How high does he go?

MATT: This is going to put it at–

WILL: 25 feet, right?

MATT: This is going to be– let's see– Need to find something to weigh that down, actually.

TALIESIN: Make a sandbag.

MATT: Perfect. All right, so it is approximately 20 feet up right now, which gets it out of predominantly melee range of most anything at the moment.

LAURA: So now when it looks down at us, does it change the direction of the cone?

MATT: The cone still spreads in the area. And it's going to look right there. So it looks away from you, Kash, so what action did you want to prepare?

WILL: Should we try it now, do you think? I'm going to try to blind it. So if he can't see, maybe he can't do some shit. So I'm going to cast Blindness at a third level.

MATT: Okay!

TALIESIN: He's reading 'Blindness' right now.

MATT: All right, so, constitution saving throw– That is a 19. Where's the DC?

MARISHA: It's fucking 18.

MATT: It resists the spell, unfortunately.

WILL: Oh, shit.

MATT: However, it is now going to make three eye ray attacks. Let's see who's in the radius here. It can't get a ray towards the four of you, so it's going to do one ray at Zahra, one ray at you, Kashaw, and another ray at Zahra. Zahra gets two rays. So, Mary, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

SAM: With inspiration.

MATT: If you need it.

LAURA: Add your inspiration, add your inspiration.

MARY: With an inspiration– I have Luck, too.

SAM: Ooh! Yeah, yeah.

LAURA: Whenever you need it, but you have an inspiration dice here. That's good. So you're at 18.

MARY: 18.

MATT: 18. Okay. A similar yellowish ray that hit Grog earlier strikes past you and it hits you, but you manage to resist the effect. A light blue ray streaks across towards you, Kashaw. I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom save.

WILL: A wisdom save?

MATT: Yes.

WILL: 20.

MATT: Slams into you, a wave of intense sleepiness comes over you, but you shake yourself out of it. Third ray goes towards you, Zahra. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

MARY: I have no dexterity–

LIAM: Come on, use Luck if it's sucky.

MARY: 17.

MATT: 17. You manage to duck out of the way as it slams into the wall behind you. This entire chunk, now, is gone.

SAM: What's behind there?

MATT: You see there's a chunk of rock and earth that has been exposed on the opposite side as it just disintegrated that portion of the room.

WILL: He can also just take apart pieces of the model, that's amazing.

MATT: That ends its turn. And now– Because at the top of the round–

MARY: Thank you, Scanlan! Love, kisses, kisses and love.

MATT: Out of one of the slimy surfaces in the room you see, all of a sudden, the stone opens up a phantom eye that just appears out of nowhere, not even attached to this beholder. As it does, another beam streaks out of it–

TRAVIS: What?

MATT: Yes. This is going to be–

TALIESIN: What?

MATT: This'll be at Scanlan.

LAURA: Where did the beam come out of? Where's the eye? Where's the phantom eye?

MATT: The eye for this one will be streaking out of this pillar here. No, no, it'll be this pillar or this wall here, and it just hits toward Scanlan. In the vicinity of the room.

MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving throw, Scanlan.

SAM: Constitution this time? 20.

MATT: 20! All right. As a familiar beam hits you and begins to lift you off the ground, you manage to grab onto the side of the stonework and pull yourself out of its force before it can throw you into the same hole that Kima had tumbled into.

WILL: The Kima hole.

(laughter)

MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: I'd like to run directly beneath it and slightly behind him.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Hold! Hold.

TRAVIS: There we go, right there, that's perfect. And I would like to use the Chain of Returning on Craven Edge and throw it up into the bottom of the Beholder.

MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

TRAVIS: 23.

MATT: That hits! With a five, it fails its saving throw, so you take a plus one strength, he takes a minus one strength.

TRAVIS: Yay, amazing! 19.

MATT: 19?

TRAVIS: Yeah, 19 points of damage.

MATT: All right, great. The blade sinks into it, as you yank it back, go ahead and make an athletics check to pull the blade back.

TRAVIS: Oh, that's an eight.

MATT: That's an eight– You yank on the chain, and it's just still embedded in the bottom of the beholder, you can't seem to pull it back.

TRAVIS: That's all right. Go for a ride.

LIAM: It's like a balloon in the Macy's Day Parade.

TRAVIS: I did get the one strength one?

MATT: You did, yes. All right, Grog, is that the end of your turn?

TRAVIS: Yes.

MATT: Scanlan, you're up. You lucky, lucky gnome, it's your turn.

SAM: He's 25 feet up?

MATT: 20 feet up, technically.

SAM: If I aim a Fireball right at the roof, will it hit any of us?

MATT: Right at the roof?

SAM: 20-foot radius.

MATT: It might, you don't know. Depends on where you're hitting. If you aim it up here, it may hit Grog.

LAURA: Just do it.

SAM: I'll aim on the far side of the beholder.

MATT: Over here?

SAM: Yeah, just up from there.

MATT: Well, you can't see that wall area because it's all blocked there, you can only see through this passage. So you can only hit anything on the ceiling and this way. Unless you move into the room.

SAM: Well, I'll just try to get it as far away from Grog as I can.

MATT: Okay. So we'll say about there is where you can hit it. Go for it.

SAM: Okay! Wand of Fireballs, and I'll do it at fourth level.

MATT: Okay! What is the DC for the wand?

SAM: If I use my– Does that go through the Handcone?

MATT: Not for the wand, no. The wand has its own DC. It should–

SAM: The wand has– ew, a DC of 15.

MATT: Okay. It does make the save, so it takes half damage. So go ahead and roll damage on that.

TRAVIS: Do I have to make a save?

MATT: Currently with the blast area– no, and it would have hit Percy, except for– as the Fireball explodes, the fire just seems to dissipate around the cone, actually absolving the flame from its current position.

SAM: Is he going to be affected?

MATT: He is affected, yes.

SAM: Okay. 30. So 15.

MATT: 15 points of fire damage. Okay. The blast, and you can see some stones (thuds) from the ceiling from the impact of the blast. It weirdly shapes around the cone in the front of its eye. And do you want to move or are you going to stay where you are?

SAM: If I move, he's going to hit me. I will inch away from the precipice?

WILL: “I will inch away from the Kima-hole.”

TALIESIN: God, you even make that sound weird.

SAM: Let's see, who's going next– I will inspire Percy with a song. I will sing: (sings) And if we're talking Percy, you got a perfect gun, so put it on me and pull that trigger, if you shoot him right, you'll end his life, on and on and on–

(cheering)

MATT: Take a d10 inspiration dice for that. All right, Percy, it's your turn.

TALIESIN: First I'm going to deal with this fucker in front of me, so I'm just going to pull out my sword and slash him and stab him and see what happens.

MATT: Okay. So using your quick draw you– Well, you have one hand, so you can pull out a second weapon. So go for it.

TALIESIN: It's a one-handed sword. That's 19 to hit?

MATT: 19 hits.

TALIESIN: All right, and that's ten points of damage?

MATT: Ten points of damage. With that you eviscerate– As it croaks out (croaks) and just falls to the ground gurgling, into a pile.

TALIESIN: Sorry. I don't speak Fish.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: It's the worst kill line ever. I especially floundered that one.

LAURA: Can I ask a technical question?

MATT: Yes.

LAURA: If I've held my action until he does something and he never does it, do I ever get to go?

MATT: Nope.

LAURA: I just hold it until the end of the turn?

MATT: Yep, and then you get a next turn.

LIAM: So technically that's a gamble, and if the thing you ask for never happens you forfeit your turn?

MATT: Let me check the rules real fast just to make sure, because I don't want to screw you over.

LAURA: It's good to know I'm gambling that away if–

MATT: Let me double-check, because the internet will let me know if I mess it up. It's technically readying an action, so–

LIAM: Did you remember Hunter's Mark?

LAURA: I didn't do Hunter's Mark on purpose. Because I can't do any magic on him, because he's looking at me.

MATT: How it is with this, essentially, is you wait for the trigger, or you can ignore the trigger, which means if you want to, you can just do it at any point if it never happens, so at the end of the next person's turn, you could unleash–

LAURA: Say 'screw it.'

MATT: Totally.

LIAM: So you can just chime in and say, 'Fuck what I said, I'm going now'?

MATT: Yeah.

TALIESIN: So, my other question is, my attempt to cast a spell while in the cone– does that cancel out that spell so I can't cast it anymore?

MATT: Yes, the spell is used, unfortunately. Beholders, man. They're assholes.

TALIESIN: I'm going to make a run for cover towards the– where's the laser pointer?

MATT: Towards which way?

TALIESIN: Run that way. There. Am I still in its–

MATT: One more, if you want to.

TALIESIN: Okay, and while I'm running I'm going to take a shot, I'm going to pull out the big gun and take a shot with the big gun.

MATT: Okay!

TALIESIN: And I'm going to attempt to make this a legs/wing hit, and I'm going to try and knock him down.

MATT: Does not have legs, does not have wings.

TALIESIN: Oh, shit, okay, that's fair.

MATT: Hovering entities aren't really affected by prone. You would know that.

TALIESIN: No they're not. That's very fair. In that case, I'm going to just do a sharpshooter shot and see how this goes.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: Roll well. And I have inspiration, which I'm going to add to that. So that's– That's 18 to hit?

MATT: 18 just hits. Scanlan comes through again!

TALIESIN: Thank you! That's very useful. Where's my other d12? Why do I never have any d12s? There they are.

MATT: Keyleth, you're on deck, so be prepared.

TALIESIN: Nine, ten, 11, 12– That's 28 points of damage.

MATT: 28 points of damage!

TALIESIN: And reload, and that's the end of my turn.

MATT: That's the end of your turn, that's all your attacks. Okay. That ends it with Percy. At the end of your turn, Percy, it's going to do one of its eye rays. This one is going to be towards Grog, because Grog is out of the cone and rushed underneath, throwing the blade up, and stuck into it. One of the eyestalks shoots down– Okay, Grog, I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I get advantage on those. Because of– D-D-D-Danger Sense! 19– 21.

MATT: 21, all right, not a worry. You manage to duck out of the way before it slams into you. All right!

TRAVIS: What kind of ray was it?

MATT: It was a black ray that streaked towards you. A ray you're very familiar with.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I remember that one.

MATT: All right, Keyleth. It's your go.

MARISHA: Question. Did enough stones fall out of the ceiling that might be, like, me-shaped?

MATT: Not from the ceiling, no. You currently only have two–

MARISHA: From the Fireball?

MATT: No, because it's mostly flame. It's the impact and explosion, it's not enough to damage the structure of it.

MARISHA: Is the ceiling considered worked stone or is it just carved out?

MATT: Unfortunately it is considered worked stone. If you wanted to, like, shape up there and try and break through it, you could attempt that.

MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: Like, the hole that was already created by Scanlan's Fireball?

MATT: Okay. So, you– what's your movement as an earth elemental?

MARISHA: Well, I dunno, I'm doing the Earth Glide, so– Oh! 30 feet? Do I make it?

MATT: 20– 30– it's cutting it close.

MARISHA: Just make it? Okay. And I just want to–

MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength check, with the strength of the earth elemental.

MARISHA: Oh wait, was that cocked? I don't know. I don't think so. And it's not great, no, seven.

MATT: Seven? No, you pull up and you slam your fist into the stone beneath you, and it cracks a little bit, but not enough to give way at all. So you are currently resting up in this vicinity.

MARISHA: That's my turn?

MATT: I mean, that's your action and your movement.

MARISHA: Try it again next time.

MATT: Kima can't do anything right now, so Kima's just currently trying to heal her wounds a bit. She can heal–

TALIESIN: “Okay! Not dead!”

LIAM: “Think I'll take a walk!”

MATT: At the end of your turn, it's going to attempt another eye ray. This one is going to be at Kashaw. Five through– well, actually, those they don't have to reroll for the same, because they're each different turns. I need you to make a dexterity save, Kashaw.

WILL: 21.

MATT: 21. You guys are rolling some serious fucking saving throws! As a DM who loves using a beholder, it's really frustrating.

(laughter)

MATT: That's great. All right, so you dodge the same black ray that just streaked past Grog, ducking out of the way as it (vmm) across the wall. All right, that brings us to Zahra.

MARY: I believe I still have Witch Bolt going. Now, my question is, because Witch Bolt is a concentration, I still have a cantrip of Eldritch Blast, which is not a concentration. May I use Witch Bolt, just the single–

MATT: Witch Bolt is an action to use and it only does 1d12.

MARY: Yes, I know, but it's still going, so technically it's an automatic 1d12 damage.

MATT: Well, you have to use your action to do it, which means you can't cast any other spells if you do it.

MARY: I can't cast any other spells.

MATT: Yeah.

MARY: Big hairy balls. All right, I'm going to Eldritch Blast, plus invoke Agonizing Blast, which does not use a spell slot.

MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll three attacks with your ranged spell attack against the beholder.

LAURA: 12s.

MARY: These are d12s. I need d10s.

LAURA: You need 20s for attacks.

MARY: Oh, just attack? I'm going to use Luck. 12?

MATT: Plus?

LAURA: Plus your attack modifier.

MARY: I'm sorry. So that's 23.

MATT: Okay, so that hits. Second one?

MARY: (groans) 13.

MATT: Misses. And the third one?

MARY: Natural one.

LAURA: Oh no.

MARY: Can't Luck on that?

LAURA: I don't think so.

MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll 1d10 plus five.

MARY: Six plus five. 11.

MATT: 11 points of damage as your beam streaks and blasts it from the side–

LAURA: I use my action, since that's the end of it, right? I pop out and I shoot two arrows at him. (grunts) That's it. Just like (groans).

WILL: That was awesome.

MATT: Both of the attacks do not get the magical bonus to hit and damage, so whatever your attack bonus is minus two to damage and hit.

LAURA: Because of my bracers. No.

MATT: Actually, it would be minus four. All of your magical equipment doesn't work when you're in its eye.

LAURA: I know, but my bracers only add to damage.

MATT: Right, but your actual bow is magical and adds to hit and damage. Minus two to hit and minus four to damage.

LAURA: Four to damage?! Why four?

MATT: Technically, it's just supposed to be plus two to hit on that item, actually. Misunderstanding. It's all good. So?

LAURA: Well, this one is 29.

MATT: That hits. And the other one is?

LAURA: 20.

MATT: This is with the minus two?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, they both hit. Roll damage on each, minus four.

LAURA: Oh, god. That's pathetic. Five. Ten.

MATT: All right. 15 points of total damage. As you streak around, releasing these two mundane arrows from a mundane bow, momentarily, both hit, and you can see now, it's starting to look a little rough. It's hurting. There's streaks of blood out of various wounds it's taken. It still has Craven Edge jammed into its underside, stuck in its craw. All right, so that brings us back to the end of Zahra's turn, where it uses its third and final ray.

MARY: I haven't moved.

MATT: Yeah, you can move if you want to. Where do you want to move?

MARY: Actually, I'm going to stay where I am.

MATT: Okay. This last ray is going to–

TRAVIS: So tense in the silent moment before he said that.

MARY: I know.

MATT: This one's going to be at Scanlan, since all of the rays have hit everything else.

LAURA: Everybody's hiding.

MATT: Everyone's in his cone or hiding and Scanlan's the one little visible one there.

LAURA: Oh, that's right. He can't attack anything within his own cone.

MATT: All right, I need you to make a constitution saving throw, Scanlan.

SAM: 17.

MATT: 17? All right. Jesus Christ, guys. You take, as this shimmering purple ray slams into your chest, you manage to get most of the ray to not impact you in the flesh, but where it hits, you do take some damage, so you suffer 16 points of necrotic damage. All right. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: I am going to– (scoffs) If I run back to where I was standing, am I out of its fricking cone?

MATT: You would be, yeah.

LAURA: All right, I'm going to do that.

(laughter)

MATT: You'd have to get over there to get to a space out of it.

LAURA: All right. Back to all my magical stuff. All right, I'm going to shoot from my Sky Sentinel at him. That's my first attack for that, and that is 22 for the first arrow, because it splits.

MATT: That hits.

LAURA: 20.

MATT: Hits.

LAURA: No, that was wrong. No, that's right. Oh, that was weird. 16?

MATT: Misses. You get two hits on that with the Sky Sentinel.

LAURA: Okay, so that adds 1d6 to my damage with those.

MATT: Correct.

LAURA: Okay. Balls. Eight, nine, ten.

MARY: Kill it.

LAURA: 16 for the first. 14 for the second. And then my second attack, I want to shoot through my Blazing Bowstring at it.

MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for attack on that one.

LAURA: 17?

MATT: As the arrow ignites in the middle of the air, the enchantment is too strong and actually burns the arrow to a cinder before it reaches its target. Just scattering ash against its body.

TRAVIS: I hope that wasn't one you notched with the owlbear feathers.

LAURA: Oh, no, that wasn't one of my owlbear arrows, for sure. I'm going to duck behind the wall right there, if I can.

MATT: Okay. Actually, currently, all of the areas of the wall are taken by Trinket and Kashaw. You could have Trinket move out of the way.

WILL: Fuck you! Get out of here. I got this part. This is taken!

LAURA: No! Okay, I push Trinket out and make him run around and hide behind the other wall.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Wow. From the mother's mouth.

LAURA: I love you! Move.

MARY: Get out of the way.

LAURA: He's got 40, so technically he could make it behind that other wall.

MATT: All right, so. At this point in time, now, you can see where the slime all over the walls– All of a sudden, a series of tendrils begin to whip out of them.

SAM: Wow.

MARISHA: What is happening?

MATT: All right, so, good to know. So now pretty much all of the slime-covered walls in here and within this hallway are now reaching out these semi-translucent, almost created out of the same slime, tendrils that are reaching out and grasping.

LAURA: What the–

LIAM: Over every part of the wall?

MATT: Yes.

MARY: How far out?

MATT: Out to here, so it's within ten feet.

LAURA: Everything at the walls. Anything hiding.

SAM: Oh, good. I'm glad that we're all right next to a wall.

MATT: Vax, it's your turn.

LIAM: Can you show me where his glance is, again, with that doohickus you have?

MATT: You have to guess. You don't know the specific elements of his ray.

LIAM: I'm going to use Cunning Action to hide.

MATT: Well, first and foremost, at the beginning of your turn, I need you to make a dexterity save.

LIAM: Yeah, evasion. Yeah, don't worry. That's 30.

MATT: All right. Don't say you're using evasion yet. It doesn't damage you. Or you could have wasted your evasion for no reason. However, you do avoid being grappled as they try and grab onto you and hold onto you. You can use your bonus action to–?

LIAM: Hide.

MATT: All right, roll a stealth check.

LIAM: That is a 25.

MATT: 25, okay.

LIAM: I'm going to run past Trinket along the back wall, all around the edge, over to where Vex and Kash are.

MATT: All right, right there.

LIAM: I'm going to keep pushing along–

LAURA: This is our spot!

LIAM: I'm going to get between them, and I know that slows the movement down, but I want to be in there, and I'm going to use my two actions left to throw daggers at the floating fucking bowling ball with eyes.

LAURA: I duck so he can shoot.

MATT: You do not have advantage, because it rolled a natural 20 on its perception check and you are not stealthed.

LIAM: Oh, wow. So the first one is a 21.

MATT: That hits.

LIAM: Yeah. Second one is a 17.

MATT: That misses.

LIAM: So it's a measly little attack of nine.

MATT: Nine points of damage. A little toothpick impact. That ends your turn.

LIAM: No! I use the last of my movement to lower down behind Kash.

(laughter)

WILL: Wow.

MATT: Kash, at the beginning of your turn, I need you to roll a dexterity save.

WILL: Ten.

MATT: Ten. The tendrils wrap around you, and you're currently grappled, which means you cannot move.

WILL: Okay, so can I cast– well, can I use Freedom of Movement on myself?

MATT: You could, yeah, if you really wanted to.

WILL: But I guess it wouldn't matter because then that's my turn, right? Am I taking any damage as it's holding onto me?

MATT: No, it's just holding you in place.

TALIESIN: It just feels really uncomfortable.

WILL: It does. It's just uncomfortable and frankly just too close to me, and now a little creepy. Then I guess there's not much I can do.

MARISHA: You can still cast a spell.

WILL: Can I cast a spell still?

MATT: You can certainly try to, yeah.

WILL: All right, then I'm going to try, even from there, being grappled, a 6th-level Flame Strike.

MARISHA: Woo!

WILL: Let's try to do some damage here, if we can.

MATT: So he's going to make his dex save, which he makes, so he takes half damage, but go ahead and roll 8d4. Oh, sorry, 8d6 points of damage.

WILL: d6. That's not bad at all. So we got ten, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

MATT: 26, nice. So half of that would be 13.

WILL: 13.

MATT: 13 points of fire and radiant damage as the column of flame bursts up around, impacting. You feel the impact from beneath you, from the blast of it.

MARISHA: Did it maybe loosen a little bit of stone up a little bit more?

MATT: Maybe.

WILL: Nice. And then I can't do anything because I'm grappled, so I can't even move.

MATT: You're grappled, so you can't move. You're there.

WILL: That was my level six spell.

MATT: All righty. That ends your turn. It is now the beholder's turn.

TALIESIN: It's been a while, hasn't it?

MATT: The beholder is going to turn this way.

TRAVIS: (laughs) Hey!

SAM: Hi!

MATT: It's going to back up this way, and it's going to stare down in this direction now.

TALIESIN: Does Grog travel with it, since he's hanging from the chain?

MATT: Do you want to hold on?

TRAVIS: Yeah. It's my fucking sword.

MATT: You get dragged along, holding onto the chain.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Yeehaw!

WILL: That is the greatest kite ever.

MATT: So that's going to be three eye ray shots.

SAM: Bye, guys.

TALIESIN: No, you're fine.

MATT: Yeah, you're in the cone. It can't hit you with its eye ray. However, based on the visual there, it's going to be two rays against Kashaw and one against you.

LAURA: Me?

MATT: Vex. Yeah.

LAURA: It can see me?

MATT: Yeah, the eyestalks can see you from there. From that vantage point at the very top, yeah. Against you, Kashaw, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

WILL: (sighs) Nine.

MATT: Nine. Your muscles tense up and lock as you are paralyzed for a minute. You're frozen. While being held by the tentacles.

WILL: Sweet.

MATT: You can't do anything on your turn.

TRAVIS: How do you like them tentacles now?

MATT: It still saw you. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

LAURA: Okay.

WILL: Come on.

LAURA: 21.

MATT: 21. Yeah, you manage to duck out of the way. This part of the wall actually, however, blasts out from the impact there as the Disintegration ray destroys the stonework. All right, and Kashaw, I need you to make– oh, no, you–

WILL: I can't do anything, you said.

MATT: You can't. You are paralyzed, so you automatically fail dexterity saving throws.

MARISHA: Oh my god, that's bad.

MATT: All right. The beam hits you and your skin begins to turn a dull gray as you begin to see your flesh beginning to harden around your body. That ends its turn. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: Can I run as far into the alcove that is at his rear, just underneath him, as far as I can? Yeah, right there. Maybe one step closer, so right underneath him.

SAM: You're still attached to the thing?

LAURA: Yeah.

TRAVIS: Yeah, so I'd like to pull the blade out.

MATT: Okay, so this will be your bonus action to pull it out. Make your athletics check.

TRAVIS: And can I– awesome. 23?

MATT: Yeah. You pull the blade out and catch it in your hand.

TRAVIS: Can I hold the rest of my action and look at Scanlan and say, hey, Scanlan! Could you give me a lift?

SAM: Maybe!

TRAVIS: All right, I'm going to hold my action for Scanlan.

MATT: (laughing) Okay. All right. At the end of Grog's turn– Actually, Grog. I fucking forgot to do that. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, which you have advantage on.

TRAVIS: 19.

MATT: You're fine. All right, so at the end of your turn, it's going to do one of its reactionary eye rays. This one is going to aim for Vex again, because you're one of the few out of its area. Okay. Vex, I need you to make another dexterity saving throw.

MARISHA: Fucking make this shit. Make it!

LAURA: 14.

MATT: 14? Okay. You keep rolling high. It's interesting, I'm missing a bunch of different rays because they aren't even doing anything. Well, this one, however: a similar black ray streaks downward and slams into you. You take 55 points of necrotic damage. All right, that is going to bring it to Scanlan's turn.

SAM: I hoof it towards the altar as fast and as far as my–

MATT: That's as far as you can get, there.

SAM: Shit. That's as far as I can go?

MATT: 25 feet. You're a gnome, man. Tiny little legs.

SAM: Can he see me?

MATT: You don't know. We'll find out if you try something.

SAM: As a bonus action, can I move a couple more feet?

(laughter)

MATT: It doesn't work that way, buddy. Sorry.

SAM: All right, I'll give it a shot. We'll see if he's looking at me. It doesn't look good, though. Wow, that's a tight angle.

TRAVIS: I think you might be just out of it.

(cheering)

SAM: I'm going to cast Bigby's Hand.

MATT: Where?

SAM: And I'm going to do something unorthodox that the DM is going to have to approve.

MATT: Okay. Where were you putting the hand, by the way?

SAM: Around Grog.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: And I would like to swing Grog like a hammer at the back of the thing.

MATT: You're fastball special-ing him with Bigby's Hand?

SAM: Yes.

MATT: I am so about this.

(laughter)

SAM: It's a goliath hammer!

MATT: Okay, I want you to go ahead and make a strength check. So roll a d20 and add eight.

SAM: 23.

MATT: Okay. The hand grabs Grog, rears back, and just full strength, lobs towards the beholder. Grog, you go flying up in the air with the added strength of Bigby's Hand behind you. What are you doing?

TRAVIS: I'm just slashing as I'm flying through the air.

MATT: Okay. You get plus eight onto each damage roll from the force of Bigby's Hand.

ALL: Yeah!

TRAVIS: I would like to reckless attack, Great Weapon Master, all three of these.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: All two of them. All two of them. So plus eight.

MATT: Well, plus eight to damage, not hit.

TRAVIS: Plus eight to damage.

MATT: Yeah, so the first one? They're reckless attacks, so you have advantage on them.

TRAVIS: 19?

MATT: 19 hits. Second attack?

LIAM: Slow motion.

TRAVIS: 22?

MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on them. Oh, this is going to be nasty, man.

LAURA: Kill him, Grog!

MARY: Kill him!

TRAVIS: Five, 10, 18, 28, 36 for the first one.

SAM: Was that 26?

LAURA: 36 for the first.

MATT: Ooh.

TRAVIS: Nine, 14, 22, 32. Plus eight is 40.

SAM: Woo!

MATT: As you go streaking through the air, Grog, arc once with the blade across the top, severing a couple of the eyestalks. The second one tears through it. Fails both of its saves with a three and a two.

(cheering)

MATT: You give it a minus two strength. Its strength is reduced by two more.

TALIESIN: Ooh, so you get another strength bonus. You bump up one.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: However, you pass over, and also then plummet immediately to the ground.

(laughter)

LIAM: He's fine.

MARY: He's so fine.

MATT: Falling prone. You take ten points of damage from the impact. Halved to five– well, no, it's not bludgeoning damage, it's just falling damage.

TRAVIS: It's like a hard sneeze.

MATT: Yeah, you take ten points of fall damage and are prone on the ground.

SAM: And Bigby's dissipates, I assume.

MATT: No, Bigby stays there, it's a bonus action. Bigby's just chilling right there where you left it, so.

SAM: Oh! Okay. Great.

MATT: All right, great! That ends– at the end of your turn, Scanlan–

SAM: I would like to use my bonus action to inspire, who's about to go– Vex!

LAURA: Me!

SAM: Vex! Who's taking selfies of her–

LAURA: I was taking a snapsnot.

SAM: I will inspire her with a limerick: Friends, I don't mean to sound bitter / But a year ago, life was a shitter. / 'Til I picked up some dice / With some friends! It was nice! / And now, ah, I'm a Critter.

(cheering)

MATT: Those words make no sense to you, but it sounds like a nice song.

(laughter)

LAURA: It didn't make any sense at all.

MATT: All right. So, at the end of your turn, Scanlan, it's going to go ahead and use another one of its eye rays.

SAM: Oh, Jesus. Should've healed myself. I'm dead.

MATT: This one's going to be at you. Make a constitution saving throw, Scanlan.

LIAM: Come on, Scanlan!

SAM: That's 11, right?

MATT: 11. You take 36 points of necrotic damage from the enervation ray.

TALIESIN: He's not down! But he's looking pretty rough.

(laughter)

MATT: All right, Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: Okay! I'm going to circle around the side of the wall.

MATT: There?

TALIESIN: Just buck myself against the wall. I'm going to take a couple shots with Bad News.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: For a first shot, I'm going to be doing– ah, fuck it, let's take a sharpshooter shot. Let's see what happens.

MATT: Sure.

TALIESIN: That's 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, that hits.

MATT: That hits, yes.

TALIESIN: 25. So that does 11, 21 points of damage?

MATT: Nice. Reload?

TALIESIN: Reload. Firing again. Also another sharpshooter shot. 23?

MATT: 23 hits.

TALIESIN: That's better. That's– oh, wow. So that's 36 points of damage. Using my Action Surge. Reloading.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Another Sharpshooter shot.

SAM: Kill him!

TALIESIN: That hits! That's the same, I have 13 for– yeah, that hits. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, that's 26 points of damage.

MATT: Looking rough, man!

SAM: How's this thing still alive?

MATT: Beholders. (gunshot) Reload. (gunshot) Reload a second time. (gunshot) Third and final shot. Each time, blasting chunks out of its flesh. You can now see, like, bits of teeth are shattered from the impact. The eye's now bloodshot and dark. Blood is, like, seeping from under the large eye, it's like (groans).

TALIESIN: I reload one last time and I am going to try and hide behind that column right over there.

WILL: Nice. Nice work, Percy.

MATT: At the end of your turn it's going to do its third and final one. All right, this is going to be at Zahra. No, Zahra, you're in its cone, so it's not going to aim it at you. You're paralyzed–

TRAVIS: (chuckles) “And you're paralyzed.”

MATT: So, it's there– Vex, you're up!

LAURA: Fuck!

MATT: Okay. Vex, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity check.

LAURA: Okay. 24?

MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

LAURA: 23, it's 23.

MATT: 23, all right. The interesting rays aren't coming up, it's really pissing me off.

WILL: The interesting rays.

MATT: These are just, like, rays that just do damage, there's ones that do cool stuff. All right, Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Okay. I forgot this last time; as a siege monster, I can deal double damage to objects and structures. I'm assuming this is a structure, yeah? If I want to, like beat through it?

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: Okay, so I'm going to do a slam attack through it. Come on! Ah, fuck. I don't know if that stone'll respond. Oh, this is to the wall, though, right?

MATT: The wall, yes. It has, like, no armor class.

MARISHA: So 14.

MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage. Double damage.

MARISHA: To the wall. 2d8 plus five.

SAM: Keyleth, attack the monster, not the wall!

MARISHA: Five, so that's 24 damage. To the ceiling.

MATT: The ceiling breaks as you move forward, falling down.

MARISHA: I'm just going to try and once again catch him in–

MATT: How many attacks do you have as the–?

MARISHA: I have two. I have a multiattack; I can use two slam attacks.

MATT: True. So you do one slam attack to break it; for a second attack you could attempt to–

MARISHA: To, like, punch the beholder into the ground?

MATT: Oh, you can attempt to make a slam attack to push it down, if that's what you're wishing to do.

MARISHA: That's what I want to do.

MATT: All right, go ahead and make the attack.

TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

TALIESIN: Big money, no whammies.

MARISHA: Okay, okay, that's not bad, that's not bad. 21!

MATT: That was awesome. Okay. 21, that definitely hits. Let me just–

LAURA: Kill him, Keyleth!

MATT: There we go. All right, so actually, that would be your athletics check.

MARISHA: I'll take it!

MATT: What was the athletics for the form?

MARISHA: (laughs) Oh. I guess I just have my dex?

MATT: Strength.

MARISHA: My strength? Which is a plus five.

MATT: Yeah, so, what's the total?

MARISHA: It was a total for my d20 roll?

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: That would be 18?

MATT: 18, that works. So no damage is dealt, but you punch the Beholder down back onto the ground, and you land at its side, right there.

LIAM: Is it on the ground or five feet above the ground?

MARISHA: Am I, like, on top of it?

MATT: It's, like, five feet above the ground; it's still within– You're not on top of it per se, because you didn't grapple, you slammed it. So you land next to it, essentially.

SAM: Nice job, Thing.

MARISHA: Okay, so I just brought him down. Do I do any damage?

MATT: You take six points of fall damage from the impact. No big deal.

LAURA: Mmm, I shouldn't say it. Do you get to stay as an earth elemental if you're right in front of him?

MATT: That's right, is it a magical ability?

MARISHA: Beast Sense? Beast Shape?

MATT: Checking right now.

MARISHA: I was wanting to, like, ride him, stand on top of him–

MATT: Right, but as part of the– that would be a grapple, as opposed to a slam, so unfortunately that wouldn't be the case. And for–

MARISHA: I would've had to, like, specify?

MATT: Wild Shape. “Magically assume the shape of a beast.” As you fall past its eye–

(groaning)

MATT: Keyleth returns to her normal form.

MARISHA: That sucks. I can't crawl backwards? I can't, y'know, like– butterfly effect?

MATT: No, that was the placement where you were above it, unfortunately. All right. That ends your turn, though. Zahra, you're up.

MARY: (sighs) All right. Oh, it's looking towards me– hmm.

MARISHA: Can I do a bonus action, then, if I fell out of my form, and cast a spell as a bonus action?

MATT: Sure.

MARISHA: Can I cast Grasping Vine? No, wait, no, never mind, I can't grapple.

SAM: Oi! Look at the guy right behind you!

MARISHA: Okay, I'll cast Healing Word on Scanlan.

TRAVIS: (laughing) There you go!

MATT: Okay! You go ahead and cast the spell, and as you reach behind– No effect.

MARISHA: Oh, son of a fuck, I'm in his fuckin' front eye! God damn it. Shit– cock– balls–

TRAVIS: You've got, like, 12 healing potions!

LAURA: They don't work in front of him, right? They're magic?

MARY: They're potions, though–

MATT: One way to find out. What are you doing, Zahra?

MARY: All right, I'm going to… One, two, three, four, five, six. I'm going back behind him.

MATT: You're aiming at the screen, I don't know where that is.

MARY: Oh, say– hey, where are you?

(laughter)

MARY: There. And then I'm going to use my Charred Dark Staff, being right next to the son-of-a-bitch, and I will use Witch Bolt one more time, only because it's got the biggest amount of damage. I'll use it at fifth level, so I'll still have one charge left on my staff.

MATT: All right! So go ahead and roll a d20 with your spell attack modifier.

LAURA: Okay, Zahra, you're going to get him. I can feel it.

MARY: Natural 20.

(cheering)

WILL: That was three, baby! That's my Z right there!

MATT: Go ahead and roll your damage. So that's 5d12.

MARY: 5d12.

SAM: Whoa! This could do it!

MARY: All right, these are all d12s.

LAURA: Those are all 12s, yes.

MARY: Okay. 19– 35– 35.

LAURA: Times two– 70.

MARY: 70.

SAM: Whoa, wait, what? Two? Wait? Huh?

MARISHA: She critted.

MATT: All right, so it's 35 points of damage on, from the five–

MARY: Plus two.

MATT: Well, the plus two's after. 35 times two, so that would be 70 points of damage.

MARY: 72.

MATT: 72 points of damage.

All right, how do you want to do this?

(cheering)

MARY: Scanlan, how would you like to use Bigby's Hand to do this?

SAM: Bigby's Hand is not doing it, you're the one doing it!

MARY: I'm doing it, all right, I want to stick my bloody staff into his eyeball and make him explode.

MATT: Okay. My token's not facing the right way.

SAM: I'll use Bigby's Hand to catch some of the sinew and blood and–

MARY: (laughing) Some of the spewing!

MATT: All right, so. As you glance over at Scanlan and give him that visual perspective of, “Let's do this,” you glance over, reach out your hand and pull Bigby's Hand towards you. It streaks up and grabs the back of the beholder like a baseball, just palming it, thrusting it down towards you, Zahra. Its mouth open, it reaches down, teeth open, momentarily frustrated by the moment, it's going to use this to try and bite down. As you reach up, you slam your staff up into its mouth and release the Witch Bolt at ground zero from the inside of its body. The eye widens for a second as the top of the staff pierces the upper part of its palate, and with a burst of black and bluish electrical energy, the entirety of its skull just (explosion), just detonates from the inside, sending chunks of slimy flesh and bone and whatever brain matter resides inside the cranium of this beholder scattering across the room.

MARY: Are we all covered in muck?

MATT: Yes, you are.

MARY: Yes!

WILL: Oil can!

LAURA: I immediately call out, help Kash!

MARY: Kash!

LIAM: And I start running to the edge. Kima! Are you all right?

MARISHA: I run to the edge with Vax, since I saw fucking Kima go over.

MARY: Can I go over and help Kash?

MATT: Yes. Well, as the beholder dies, the ray eventually fades off– And the tendrils retract into the wall.

MARY: So I pull him up, pick him up.

LAURA: I run to look over the edge to take care of Kima, too.

MARY: Covered in muck, I look at my brother and I say, are you all right?

WILL: I'm all right, thank you.

LAURA: I'm pulling the rope out and trying to lower it over the edge.

LIAM: I'm going down, I'm rappelling. Rappelling. Rappelling.

MATT: You hear the voice echoing from inside: “I'm all right! Relatively speaking.”

MARISHA: Vax is coming down to get you!

LIAM: Hold on, yeah, yeah, I'll give a– piggy-back you up, come on. Just wait a moment.

MATT: As you come down, pulling your dagger out and using it as a torch, down in the inside as you're lowered, you can see there are hundreds of partially eaten corpses of those fish humanoids that you encountered earlier, as well as what appears to be various cradles of gathered slime and putrescence, the real core of where this Beholder had been existing at the bottom of this tomb.

LAURA: If you'd gone down there, I would've jumped right down there.

MATT: Kima's down there, currently holding one shoulder. You can see, she's tended to herself with her wounds for the most part on her own, but just currently looks up, like, “I've got nothing.” As soon as you descend from the pit dangling from the rope, she goes: “Okay! Good.”

LIAM: Hold on, let's tie you up. Grog?

TRAVIS: Yeah?

LIAM: I'm going to tie her up, you're going to pull her up first, and then throw it down and get me.

TRAVIS: Pull her up and throw her down?

LIAM: Yeah– no! Almost! Just pull Kima up!

TRAVIS: Okay!

LIAM: Step two is coming! And I'm going to use perception on this pile of bones down here as she gets yanked up.

LAURA: Look for any loot!

MATT: Roll investigation.

MARY: Should we go to the tomb?

SAM: I'm chugging a greater healing potion while I look around for any loot around the altar and around the dead bodies.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: Trinket, with me, if you wouldn't mind. And we're going to walk up to the altar and push the sarcophagus open.

MATT: Okay. So you guys move up and push the sarcophagus open. As you guys slowly start bringing Kima up, the rope itself tense with the weight, 'cause she's wearing a lot of armor, but it manages to pull her up without issue. You go ahead to the top of the sarcophagus there and it is covered in black feathers, some of which got pushed off in the battle. You shove the top open and you can see inside a skeletal corpse that is resting, surrounded by what looks like very, very fine golden and silver jewelry that have just been laid at its sides. And on the corpse itself, you can see there is a set of jet-black studded leather armor that has a series of runic engravings and carvings along pretty much every square inch of the leather. And you can see around the mantle of it, where the leather mantle falls, the edge is trimmed with black feathers.

MARISHA: That's hot.

TRAVIS: That's fuckin' sick.

LIAM: That's some Labyrinth of Jareth shit right there.

TRAVIS: Artists, go!

MATT: Make an investigation check.

LIAM: 15, a very average 15.

MATT: 15?

LAURA: I'm trying to– Brother, I'm going to go look at the stuff that they're finding, okay? Be safe!

LIAM: Okay. I'm looking through some bones.

LAURA: And I run over to the sarcophagus.

MATT: You find what looks to be– roughly, within the brief time you've spent, and you've spent like a good ten minutes kind of, like, combing through the slime, you find about six gold pieces.

LIAM: Oh, wow. Are there any fish-guy bones?

MATT: Plenty of fish-guy bones, yeah!

LIAM: I play a couple of them on the wall. Do a little song.

MATT: All right. It's beautiful with the echo, it gives it this sort of reverberation effect to it.

WILL: Kash walks over and heals Kima.

MATT: Okay, as Kima gets pulled over the edge, you reach over and help. She's like, “Thanks, appreciate that, I– that didn't go as planned. I'm a little embarrassed.”

LAURA: (laughs) All good, Kima!

MATT: “It was a very long fall! And I survived that–”

TRAVIS: You did! Did you feel anything squish when you landed?

MATT: “Eh, nothing I couldn't handle.”

TRAVIS: Did you black out?

MATT: “No.”

SAM: Did you pee your underoos?

MATT: (laughs) Make an insight check.

TRAVIS: Shit, my insight's balls– Five.

MATT: No, man. She owned that fall!

TRAVIS: Yeah, you's a badass bitch.

MARY: It was a heck of a scream as you went down.

LIAM: Grog!

TRAVIS: Yeah?

LIAM: Throw down the rope! Please?

TRAVIS: Oh, I so want to just throw the entire rope down.

(laughter)

LIAM: Pretty please?

TRAVIS: Without holding onto the other end? No, no, no, I know what he means.

LAURA: It's infinite rope!

TRAVIS: Yeah, but I would throw the whole thing down. I throw it down to him.

MARY: Are there any beholder teeth left? Anything? Any sort of–

MATT: I mean, there are chunks of, there are a few full teeth that you could try and take.

MARISHA: Keyleth actually goes over and starts doing her harvesting thing.

MATT: Not a whole lot left to harvest. Like, it is destroyed. There's a few eyestalks that you could probably pull.

MARISHA: Yeah, that's true, I'll check out the eyestalks.

LAURA: Can we perception check the tomb and see if it's safe to grab shit out of it?

MATT: Sure, go ahead and make an investigation check

TRAVIS: Hey, Vax, you got that rope yet?

LIAM: Thank you!

TALIESIN: I'm going to– Very gently, I'm removing the leather armor from the body.

MATT: Okay, I need Vex, I need Percy, and I need Trinket to all make dexterity saving throws.

LIAM: Evil shit.

LAURA: One.

SAM: Dead. Instant death.

LIAM: Why are you rolling twice?

LAURA: For Trinket!

TALIESIN: I'm going to use one of my re-reroll a saving throw.

LAURA: Six for Trinket! It's a good night, you guys.

SAM: Did I find any loot in the bodies of the losers? The little guys?

MATT: You find a bunch of shitty spears, crappy leather, and through all them all, about 12 gold pieces.

TALIESIN: That can almost buy a book. 21.

MATT: You manage, as you reach out and grab for the armor, as your fingers touch it, there's this vibration and it seems like the shadows, the nearby shadows in the corners, seem to reach up towards your hands. You pull back in time, but you and Trinket notice a little too late as there's a burst of death. A burst of death energy that just bursts out for a ten-foot radius around the entire sarcophagus. You avoid it. Both you and Trinket suffer 56 points of necrotic damage.

LAURA: I'm unconscious. Trinket–

MATT: Does that bring you below zero?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Vex's body falls and hits the stonework, and you look over as you see her eyes stare up, the last bit of air escaping from her lungs as the life drips out of her form.

TALIESIN: Oh shit.

MARY: What?

LIAM: What's going on?

TALIESIN: Running over.

MARY: What? Running over, pouring a healing potion in her mouth, instantly, as quickly as possible.

WILL: I can revive her too.

MARY: Kash, do something.

MATT: The healing potion has no effect, and as you go to her, you can already feel the clutch to her skin. Her body is instantly cold from the necrotic blast.

MARISHA: Kashaw!

MATT: You glance over at the sudden intense energy of the room and see your sister lying cold and lifeless on the ground, being cradled by Zahra.

LIAM: The fuck happened?

MARY: Kash, Kash, Kash.

WILL: I can raise the dead.

LIAM: I run over.

WILL: I can revivify or I can raise the dead.

MARISHA: Revivify, revivify.

WILL: Let's do it.

LIAM: I'm already running over. I'm picking her up. What happened? I was only down there for 30 seconds.

MATT: Do you have it prepared?

WILL: What do you mean?

MATT: Do you have it prepared as one of your prepared spells?

WILL: I believe so, yeah.

MATT: Check your list to see if it has a little dot next to it.

LIAM: I'm pouring a healing potion in her mouth. I'm pouring a greater potion in her mouth.

MATT: Okay. No effect.

LIAM: The fuck is going on?

WILL: Yes, I do.

TALIESIN: Do it. Do it.

WILL: I do. I have it prepared.

SAM: It's true. It's written down. It's true.

TALIESIN: Do it.

WILL: And I have third levels left.

TALIESIN: Do it.

MARISHA: Oh my God, I'm shaking.

WILL: I can bring her back.

MATT: You rush over. You reach in your pouch and pull out a bit of clustered diamonds in your hand that you keep just in case for such a circumstance, and as you place them out, you sprinkle them across her chest, pushing Vax a little bit away, knowing that you need the concentration on this, at which point you pull up the symbol, and this type of magic, life and death magic, draws a little closer than you feel comfortable with Vesh, and you realize at this moment that you're going to have to make the choice to possibly call her attention forth.

SAM: Call whose attention forth?

LIAM: What are you hesitating for? Do it. Whatever the fuck you're going to do, do it.

WILL: She could destroy everything.

LIAM: Do it.

MARISHA: What do you mean, she could destroy? What do you mean?

SAM: Who's she?

WILL: I mean the dragons are going to be the least of your fears if she comes back. That's what I mean.

MARISHA: Kashaw, you're running out of time.

SAM: Who's she?

WILL: I'm going to bring her back.

MATT: Okay. So, we're going to do a quick ritual skill challenge as part of this revivify enchantment. So as you grasp the symbol, and as you do, you can see all of the scars across your forearm begin to light with a deep red crimson energy, just (hissing sound), and you close your eyes, and as you look up, you can see Kash's eyes just go straight black, and this dark energy begins to swirl off, and as it reaches out, it touches the diamonds, which then shatter upon impact, and the dark energy seeps into your sister's corpse. The back arches, though she does not register on the face or any of her movement. Her body lifts slightly in place, her arms just draped, dangling and scraping against the stone beneath her as she's elevated there. How do you guys want to help with this ritual?

TALIESIN: I take out three of my shards of residuum, and I place them in where the crystals are as an extra offering.

MATT: Okay, so you place the residuum across where the diamond dust was shattered and use that as almost a focus for the energy from the spell. All right, I need you to go ahead and roll an intelligence check. Just roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

LAURA: I'm going to throw up. Oh no.

TALIESIN: I can use my rerolls as well, correct? I can't use my–

MATT: That's for saving throws, not for ability checks. What did you roll?

TALIESIN: Six.

MATT: Six. The energy itself vibrates within the glass shards, which then shatter, seemingly not able to focus the energy of the spell.

MARY: I take my enchanted moonstone from my staff and place it next to her.

MATT: Okay, so as you take the moonstone, and– are you speaking to your patron to aid with this?

MARY: I am.

MATT: All right, so as you take the moonstone and hold it aloft, you place it near the focus of Kashaw's ritual. The dull white glow begins to intermingle with the dark, shattered energy of Vesh's grant, and as they impact, it creates this strange grey swirl. I need you to go ahead and roll an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add your arcana skill to it.

LIAM: Depending on what she does, I'd like to do something next.

LAURA: (whispered) That's good. That's good.

MARY: 17.

MATT: Okay. The grey balances, and where the two meet now, there is just grey energy seeping into her body. You, focusing, look up at the altar where the body was, and you see the very faint drifting image of a dark female form looking on. Who wants to make the third and final attempt to aid?

SAM: I will–

LIAM: I do.

SAM: Oh, sure, I will let you do that.

LIAM: I pull my sister in close, and I say, take me instead, you raven bitch.

MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check. With advantage.

LIAM: 11.

MATT: 11. Okay. At this point, the dark female form that drifts from the altar, you glancing up intently, feeling the sudden intense, fearful gaze of Vesh upon you. As it gets closer and closer, the presence is different. What you feared was Vesh is not Vesh, actually. It is an image, a specter of the Raven Queen herself. The face is formless at this proximity. You can't make any details. It's just this perpetually blurred female form of a face. The hair just tumbles down past, and as it steps forward, no expression, no words. The hand reaches out towards you, Vax. There's a nod. The magic strengthens, focusing through your moon crystal into Vax's body. I'll take a picture of this so that no one questions this. A moment passes. A second moment passes. The vision of the Raven Queen nods the head to you, steps backward, and the specter vanishes. (gasping) Breath fills Vex's lungs as she begins to cough, her form drifting back to the stonework. Your vision clears, and you find yourself looking up at the partially broken stone ceiling of the dark altar into the face of your brother, tears streaming down his face, the rest of your friends gathered around.

LAURA: What happened?

MARY: Hello, darling.

LAURA: I feel so cold.

LIAM: You were knocked out.

LAURA: Knocked out?

LIAM: Yeah.

LAURA: (sighs) Well, that was a close one. (laughs) Did we find anything?

MARISHA: I reach out, and I touch Vax on his back. Do I feel or sense anything different?

MATT: No.

LAURA: (exaggerated sobbing) God.

MARY: I take my stone and put it back in my staff.

LAURA: Why are you crying?

LIAM: I'm not crying, stupid.

WILL: I'm all right. You people suck.

SAM: I just hand Vex 30 gold and say, sorry about before.

LAURA: What happened?

TRAVIS: You fucking died.

MARY: Grog.

TRAVIS: Yeah. We turned around. I pull your brother out of the pit, and you're laying there lifeless on the floor.

LAURA: What?

MATT: At which point, you immediately have this perpetual slapping of wet bear tongue across your face as Trinket is just (bear noises) nuzzling up against you and, like, pressing all his weight against your body to an almost intense degree.

LAURA: All right, all right. Your breath is lovely. Okay. How did I–

TRAVIS: How do you feel?

LAURA: I feel– I feel cold?

MARY: Here, take my cape.

LAURA: How am I not dead, then, if I died–?

TRAVIS: That's a good question. Vax, how are you feeling?

LAURA: (softly) Vax–

LIAM: I walk out of the chamber.

LAURA: Wait, Percy, did you set off a trap? Is that how I died?

TALIESIN: Yes.

LAURA: (laughing nervously) Well– who brought me back?

SAM: Kash.

TALIESIN: And your brother.

LAURA: Oh.

TRAVIS: And Zahra.

LAURA: Oh.

MARISHA: I grab Kash by the hand and, just to him: What does this mean?

WILL: To be honest, I have no idea.

MARISHA: How do you feel?

WILL: I feel okay. I hope the barrier that was sealed has remained sealed, or this is the start of very bad things.

MARISHA: Why did you do that?

WILL: 'Cause I knew you wanted me to.

TRAVIS: Hey, Vex, do you want any, like– ale or anything? You– I got some, like, firewater?

LAURA: Yes! Yeah, yeah, give me some of that. It'll warm me up.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: We need to get those– those leathers, those vestiges or whatever, and get the– out of here.

TRAVIS: Well, I think that was the problem, right? Did we get it?

MATT: No, that's– the moment you touched it is when that blast went off.

TRAVIS: Right.

LAURA: Can we not– can we investigate it and see if there's any traps? I mean, how do we make sure it doesn't happen again?

MARY: Well, let's keep you away from it for now, darling. Have a sip of firewater, just to warm you up.

TRAVIS: Here, here's a big flask of firewater.

WILL: Can we read any of the runes that are on the–

MATT: As you walk back up to the altar and look on the inside, the corpse is dust. The blast, whatever it was, while it didn't damage anything, seemingly, the remains are dust. The armor is laid there, same place it was when you found it, if a little slumped in without any sort of something to fill it out. Also, most of the jewelry that's there has turned green and seems to have been robbed of whatever precious metal it was once contained. The only thing that sticks out to you is what looks to be a black crystal that comes to a point on one end. It has a loop on it like it was part of a medallion or a necklace or some sort of a loop to carry on a chain. Those are the only two things you see within.

MARY: So the leather is gone?

MATT: No, the leather is there. The corpse is gone.

MARY: Yes. All right. Is there any way to pick this up without touching it? I mean, is there any way to– can I use Mage Hand to lift it?

MATT: Yeah, yeah. It's pushing the boundaries of Mage Hand, but you can try.

MARY: I can hold up to ten pounds.

MATT: Yeah. It's full leather armor. You can just– I'd say–

SAM: I can assist, I've got Mage Hand as well.

TRAVIS: Look, I'm a giant tank and I've got a super long, like, sword, I could try and give it a pick-up if everybody backs away.

MARY: Well, what if I lifted it up and put it onto your sword, and then you could carry it out that way?

TRAVIS: I was going to put it in the Bag of Holding.

MARY: Oh, put it in the Bag of Holding? Can I lift it up and put it in the Bag of Holding?

WILL: Again, can we read anything that's written on it?

MARY: Well, we need it, that's what's going to help you guys.

MATT: Well, all the runes are inscribed there; you can make an arcana check. Or religion check, one of the two, probably would.

MARY: I glance at it, I can read. I have Eyes of the Runekeeper.

MATT: The language is a forgotten language. It has been dead for– probably since before the Divergence. But your eyes clarify on it in the arcane nature of your sight. You pick up phrases throughout, and it is a tale of the creation of the Raven Queen. It is a tale of her ascendance from mortal to immortal. It is the history of her penance for ascending and taking the throne of another entity that was supplanted. It's just seemingly a history tale that is woven in with a very, very strong enchantment, and you see within each one of these little runic sections, there are mentions of elements: fire, ice, lightning, you know, it runs through all these various elemental arcane properties that are bound into this enchantment. You're not entirely certain what the nature of it is.

MARY: Well, do you want to put it into the Bag of Holding and then deal with it later, when you're up against these things?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

SAM: Matt, I just did an arcana check and got a 23; does that help us know anything at all?

MATT: Okay. It is very magical, it is very enchanted, and I'd say, based on the circumstances in looking at this, whatever the blast that was set off here, the runic elements that maintained that trap that were in the sarcophagus are currently expended.

SAM: Okay. Let's take it!

MARY: All right, what about the jewelry and the black crystal?

MATT: You can take the black crystal as well.

TRAVIS: It was the runic things in the sarcophagus that set off that blast, not the leather itself?

MATT: You don't know. But there were two runic circles within the inside of the sarcophagus that were not visible when you first looked into it, that are both now visible and expended of energy.

TRAVIS: All right, yeah, let's put it in the Bag of Holding. You want to Mage Hand onto my swordy, and then we shish-kabob it into the bag?

MARY: Yes, I'll take the crystal as well. Is that the only thing– the rest are all tarnished and green, yes?

MATT: Yeah.

MARY: All right. So here's the black– can I do an investigation check on the crystal at all, or–?

MATT: You'd probably have to take some time with it, like a short rest, to go ahead and ascertain the nature of it.

MARY: All right. Well, maybe on the way back. I don't know. Get some insight– so here. Mage Hand it up. There we are.

MATT: So you gather your findings, your first retrieval of one of the Vestiges of Divergence a success, barring difficult circumstances. You make your way back out through the tomb.

MARISHA: I walk up to Vex. And I just say: you know, he loves you very, very much. So very much.

LAURA: Thank you, dear.

MARY: I'm so sorry, but we still have to deal with the water and getting out of here. A stone– don't we have a stone wall there? We still have to get out.

MARISHA: I still have one more Control Water spell I can do.

MATT: Yeah. Well, it wouldn't be an issue. We'll say for the sake of story brevity, you guys make your way up through the temple in relative silence, just taking in the moments that have transpired. Through the aid of Keyleth and the rest of the party, you manage to make your way back out the way you came, parting the remnants of the Marrowglade Loch, and start making your way back, in the darkened evening hours, towards Vasselheim.

LAURA: We need rest!

MATT: Do you want to rest on the outside of the loch here?

LAURA: I feel like we should maybe camp and sleep and rest up and get– I don't know, it's up to you guys.

TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I think a little treeline rest would be a good idea. Before we go anywhere else.

MARY: I pull Vex aside and say, walk with me for a moment.

LAURA: Okay.

MARISHA: And I go with Kashaw.

MATT: Okay.

MARY: I'm not sure what just happened, but I need you to know that you're very dear to me. I've only known you for a short period of time– At any rate, while you were gone, and I'm not sure how much time I'll be spending with you from now– I have something for you. After our fight with Rimefang, I forged something for you as well. And it is one Arrow of Dragon-Slaying. And I want you to have this, if for some reason I'm not here, or I can't help you. I want you to use this to do whatever you can to get rid of these things.

LAURA: (whispers) Thank you, Zahra.

MARY: You're welcome.

LAURA: Want to kill it.

MARY: Yeah. I want you to kill it. And I want you to write me and tell me how you did it. Details. Lots and lots of details.

MATT: Now it's Keyleth and Kashaw–

MARISHA: You know, Kashaw, for a cleric, I was concerned maybe you didn't believe in much at all. And I was very unsure of how you got all of your radiant powers, considering I didn't know what you believed in. But you must believe in something. So what is it?

WILL: I believe in life. That's all I was raised to believe in, was life. When you're married to death, it's pretty much all you have. And I didn't believe in any actual person until I met Zahra. She saved my life. She didn't have to, but she did. And she started to teach me what it meant to have family. I didn't really know what that was like until I first saw you guys together. I figured there was no way that was going to happen, and then there she was, and suddenly I had a sister. Once again I realized that, at the end, life conquers all.

MARISHA: Well, you did our family a great service today, and you didn't have to do that.

WILL: Yeah. Vax would've killed me. And like I said, I believe in life– mine, above all others. He's a good guy, you know. And a hell of a warrior. A little creepy, the way he's always staring at you, but I can't really blame him.

MARISHA: You know, you're a good guy too, even though you try really hard to pretend not to be.

WILL: Don't let that get out, I got a reputation.

MARISHA: Thank you. For everything.

WILL: There is something you have to do for me, though. You got to go and kill these fuckers.

MARISHA: You actually think we can do it?

WILL: I don't really know, but I know that no one else will be able to. I hope you can. That Grog guy's fuckin' huge.

MARISHA: Yeah, he is.

WILL: Stay near him. Behind him, maybe.

MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

WILL: Or just stay near Vax. He'll look out for you.

MARISHA: And thanks for looking out for me.

WILL: Yeah, you don't suck.

MARISHA: By the way, y'know, you didn't need to apologize for stealing that kiss before, it was fine.

WILL: Well, that's good to know. It was only my second one!

MARISHA: What? Really? It was my first!

WILL: Really?

MARISHA: Yeah!

WILL: Well, between us we've had three kisses now, I think we did pretty well.

MARISHA: Aww, yeah! High five!

WILL: Oh, right!

MARISHA: Question. Who was your first kiss?

WILL: That would be my wife.

MARISHA: Oh, sure, yeah.

WILL: Yeah.

MARISHA: Yeah, no, that makes sense.

WILL: (deadpan) Well, this has been pleasant.

MARISHA: Cool, yeah, no, it has been–

(laughter)

WILL: Very, very nice talking to you again. I'm glad that it's not awkward at all.

MARISHA: I– Yeah.

WILL: Okay. All right.

MARISHA: Well, I c– we should probably–

WILL: I'm going to camp across the way from you tonight, if that's all right. Just 'cause it's a little weird, so.

MARISHA: That's fine. Okay.

WILL: All right. Cool.

MATT: As you guys head back, the rest of you have gathered at the same camp set-up you had the night before. Kima– while you guys were doing this, Kima's fixed a little bit of a meal at the base and set up her own Bahamut arc of protection on the tree below where you guys are set up. As everyone gathers around, she kinda gets your attention for a moment and goes: “All right, so best that I can understand, we have most of our allies and many of the survivors at your place, right, in Whitestone?”

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: “While you're seeking most of these things, that's where the bulk of our hope resides. This is also, you say, where Allie is, and where the rest of the survivors of the Council are.”

TALIESIN: Yes, everyone. Everyone that we could save.

MATT: “Okay. Well, for the time being, I'm probably going to head there and make sure that we have defense in case any of these dragons manage to get some sort of wind that this is where their possible usurpers are. They're going to hit it, and they're going to hit it hard. Want to make sure that we have at least a decent chance of defending these people. So I figure, all strength that we can spare, beyond those that are searching for these artifacts, go and stay there at the moment. Besides, it'd be good to catch up with a few friends, myself.”

MARY: Lovely meeting you, Lady Kima. Come and find me when you return to Vasselheim.

MATT: “You're welcome to join us in Whitestone. We could use the help over there.”

LAURA: Both of you?

MATT: “I can guarantee you, probably, seeing what you guys can do today, we can definitely make use of that better over there than killing things for cash here in Vasselheim. But to each their own. Just a noble cause. Helping your friends, whatever.”

MARY: I'd have to put it to the group of Vox Machina. Is that all right with you?

LAURA: Yes! We'll meet you in Whitestone!

TALIESIN: Whitestone would be honored.

MARY: I'd be more than happy to. I'd be honored, actually.

WILL: As would I, but– damn, this is going to be awkward now. We just had the whole big thing. All right.

MARISHA: Well, I mean, we're– we'd be passing through, it'd be–

WILL: Yeah. Fair enough. We'd love to help. Just the world and everything, so.

MARISHA: Just– it'd be great, yeah. It's big. It's a big, big world.

MATT: “And, just to put this out there, and I don't mean to say this in any selfish way, but I'm really sick of sleeping in trees. Do you have one of those tree travel things you have already to Whitestone? I could really use a bed.”

MARISHA: Sure, yeah. Yeah.

LAURA: We could all head that way, actually.

SAM: To Whitestone?

LAURA: Do we need to go back, I don't know, sleep for the night?

MARY: I think we could all use some rest, don't you?

TALIESIN: We still have the Fire Ashari.

MARISHA: We do still have the Fire Ashari. Granted, I could theoretically just tree back. You guys want to go take a nap at Whitestone?

LIAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

WILL: Could use a bed.

MATT: “Great!”

MARISHA: Tree Stride.

MATT: As the tree opens– Teleport via Plants. As the tree splits open, showing the portal, Kima, whose eyes light up, looks over. “That–”

MARISHA: See? Yeah.

MATT: “Well played, druid. Well played.” And she charges through eagerly, and you guys all follow suit out of the Sun Tree in Whitestone and find yourselves a comfortable bed to sleep for the evening. And that's where we'll call tonight's game. I know it was long, but also, due to scheduling shifts and, y'know, Will couldn't stay for the next week, I didn't want to have to leave in the middle of that, I wanted to give you guys closure to the arc. So thank you for staying for a long session.

TRAVIS: Happy-one-year-anniversary extended edition.

WILL: One year. Congratulations to you guys. That's awesome.

TALIESIN: We haven't had a near-death in ages! I am so sorry! I am so sorry! Oh god.

LAURA: I had just rolled an investigation, before I could even– I had just rolled to check for traps and then you pulled the stuff.

MATT: It's only the Champion of the Goddess of Death, man.

LAURA: No, you know what? Thank you– all of you– for not–

MARISHA: (yells) What did you roll?

MATT: Huh? I rolled a 12.

LAURA: A 12, okay. What were you aiming for?

MATT: The DC starts at ten. Each failure increases the DC by one, and a success lowers it by three. So it had gone to 12, and the success had brought it down to a nine. If I had rolled an eight or lower, you'd have been gone for good.

LIAM: Would she or would I?

MATT: Well, she would've been gone for good. You would've had to have made a very serious journey elsewhere, possibly, to make that exchange.

MARY: What about Trinket?

LAURA: He survived, he didn't even go below zero on that hit. I was just already at 41, so it lowered me. He had four hit points left.

TRAVIS: The best part of that was that you were totally out of the blast range, and you were like, “I want to go be there when they open up the sarcophagus.” (explosion)

WILL: Yeah! She ran back! Totally!

LAURA: I know! No, believe me, I am aware that my greed fucking did that to me. I am aware.

WILL: Life lesson.

MARY: And will she learn from this moment?

WILL: I thought for a second I hadn't written down that spell, I was like, “Oh my god, wait, I didn't write, oh, yes, there it is, thank god.” Oh my god.

MATT: You still could've done Raise Dead, it just would've been a little more expensive.

WILL: That's crazy, though–

MARISHA: Well, I thought Raise Dead just brought them back, like, to life as a zombie, that's what I thought.

MATT: No no no, no, Raise Dead is a proper, like, resurrection-type spell. It just is really expensive, and it's a ritual, there are limitations to it. Revivify is good, but it has to be used within a minute. Which means when you used previously before and we were in mid-combat, and I didn't want to do the whole frickin' ritual in the middle of the battle, so I let it go through.

MARISHA: Because Pike got on him next turn.

WILL: That's crazy.

LAURA: Ashley was texting as it was happening. Like, “No!”

MATT: Thank you, Mary and Will, for–

TRAVIS: Thank you Mary and Will, yes!

MARISHA: And Mary, getting the “How do you want to do this?” again!

MATT: Yeah! I know, man!

MARY: I like big beasts. And I–

MATT: That was, that was a good– that was delightful overkill. That was, like six points left on that beholder. And you're like, “Oh, like 70-something.”

MARY: Look, my timing is fucking perfect, though, I always get either the Hellish Rebuke or the Witch Bolt right. It's all about timing, is all. Because he was really slashed up.

MATT: He was wrecked.

LAURA: Still.

MARY: Yeah, he was.

MATT: Guys, well done. Well, welcome back, glad we're–

TALIESIN: Never sleep again!

MATT: We, yeah, we'll see you next week. Hopefully we'll be announcing a special guest we'll have the following week, schedule barring. We'll have a guest in a couple of weeks, hopefully. Should be fun for the announcement. But guys, thank you so much for sticking with us as long as you have. And we'll see you next week. Is it Thursday yet? 

Part I

MATT: So. Where we left off. The party of Vox Machina, having to deal with the current terrible danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of very dangerous dragons that have torn through the entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on this quest to collect allies, and find these items called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to be the best way you could prepare yourselves for going up against these terrifyingly powerful entities. In searching for this, you went and made your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw, two allies from previous installments of our wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut, and you all went to seek the first bit of information you discovered about one of these vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been entombed within this temple that had sunken beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake, finding your way through this subterranean, watery location, you found the location of the tomb, upon which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa, had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of this temple, a rather strange slime-covered beholder, that then surprised the party. The battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a bear, and claimed the life of our beloved Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful in bringing her soul back from the other side, restoring her to life, and the party then, figuring out what their next step in their journey was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's Teleportation via Plants spell, back to Whitestone, which seems to be building as this defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and a good place to keep your allies at the time. And that was where we left off, as you guys had just stepped back into Whitestone.

LAURA: We haven't actually slept yet, then.

MATT: Nope!

LAURA: It's late.

MARISHA: What time is it here?

MATT: I'd say through the evening's travels– Well, you guys slept all night the night before you went to the temple, the temple's probably been–

MARISHA: That's true, we did sleep, actually, we camped out.

LAURA: We did?

MARISHA: Remember? You talked to Zahra, and I talked to Kash? Then we slept.

MATT: Yeah, you guys did camp out.

LAURA: Oh. I didn't know if we camped, I thought we talked.

MATT: You talked.

MARISHA: We at least chilled. I don't know.

MATT: Regardless. You found your way to Whitestone. We'll say for the sake of the current setting, you've come in in a rather overcast mid-afternoon in Whitestone, you may have spent some time there gathering yourselves as your allies scope out their new surroundings, the people of Whitestone accepting you as you arrive, you can always see people walking by and catching a glance at the group of heroes known as Vox Machina that helped liberate them from the oppressive Briarwoods not long ago.

TALIESIN: Keep crawling out of trees.

MARISHA: It's always weird. Not crawling out of trees, that people like us.

TRAVIS: Should we inspect our spoils?

TALIESIN: I was going to say, we should take the armor and the necklace to the castle and have it inspected.

LAURA: Is Lady Allura here?

MATT: Kima, who is with you, is like, “Is she?”

LAURA: No. Well, she was on her way to Westruun, and we haven't heard from her yet.

TALIESIN: No.

MATT: “Haven't heard from her since– You say Westruun was under attack as well?”

LAURA: Yes, but she knew it. She was going in secret.

MATT: “That prideful woman.” She slings her hammer off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and says, “Well. If she doesn't arrive in the next few hours, I'm going to gather a party and we're going to go to Westruun and find her.”

TRAVIS: Yeah!

MARISHA: Kima– Wait, what? Why?

LAURA: Wait, there's a dragon there, Kima, a very large one, and she was being very, very stealthy–

MATT: Her hammer slams into her metallic armor, and she goes, “I've a much bigger dragon backing me up.” And she looks up to the sky for a second and grins.

TRAVIS: Lady Kima don't give a fuck.

LAURA: We'll wait, Kima.

MATT: (frustrated sigh)

LAURA: Going in loud will only cause more trouble.

MATT: “I'll wait a few days.”

LAURA: She should be here by then.

MARISHA: I can always attempt to scry, and see if I can check in on her.

MATT: “Okay. Not a bad idea.”

MARISHA: Okay.

MATT: “Okay. I need a drink.”

MARISHA: Let's get somewhere safe.

MATT: She charges off, looking for the nearest tavern.

MARISHA: Here, I guess. I don't know. I forget it's not overrun by vampires, I'm sorry. Sorry, I forgot; it's all right now.

LAURA: Maybe somewhere safe, like right here–

MARISHA: Like right here, sorry, there's a lot going on.

MATT: Zahra and Kashaw looking around expectantly as you continue this conversation. Kash crosses his arms, goes, “Great place. There's a lot of white.” Of which Zahra comes and steps over and is like, “Don't worry, darling. (laughter) So, sleeping arrangements, I hope?”

LAURA: Yes, the castle.

TALIESIN: We'll be putting you up in the castle.

MATT: “That's what I like to hear. All right. To the castle, Kash?” “Sure. It's better than, well, it's better than anything. Let's go for the castle.” And they both make their way towards Whitestone Castle, to find a comfortable place to get themselves situated in their new surroundings.

LAURA: So we're healed up, we are healed, we are not running the risk of dying at any moment, because we've been healed.

MATT: What is that? What is that blur of green?

TRAVIS: It's a fucking leprechaun, get it!

SAM: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

LIAM: You should be.

MARISHA: Your shirt, is that new? Because I love it so much.

SAM: Thanks! But I'm also wearing a tie because it's a special night.

LAURA: Right. It's a special occasion.

SAM: (sighs) So, is Allura dead?

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Kima just left, so–

LAURA: She's on her way to a tavern. Kima's drinking it up. Grog! Kima's drinking it up.

MARISHA: Are we heading to a tavern?

TALIESIN: We're heading to the castle. We're going to talk to friends, we're going to take a look at–

TRAVIS: Corpse armor, hello.

MARISHA: Oh, corpse armor.

TRAVIS: Yeah. You know, the thing that almost killed our friend over here?

LAURA: It did kill me. According to you.

TALIESIN: It– yes.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but, I mean, you're here, so you didn't die. But you did. But you didn't. But you did. And then you didn't.

LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

TRAVIS: Yep.

MATT: All right, so. You guys all heading to the castle?

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: You head to the castle. Cassandra isn't there at the moment, but Keeper Yennen is currently there with a few other members of the makeshift council you guys put together towards the end. One of the heads of the entire farming establishment here in Whitestone is with them, and they're having a conversation. As Zahra and Kashaw burst in first, he's like, “I'm sorry, we're not currently taking visitors, could you– Oh. Friends of yours, I presume?”

TALIESIN: Good friends.

LAURA: Helpers, actually. They're going to be here for a while. Hopefully.

MATT: “Gracious. Oh, I see you yourself carry the vestments of a man of the cloth. Who brings your power this day?” Kashaw gives him a look and goes, “You don't even want to know, buddy.” Walks past him.

TALIESIN: That was a really good Kashaw.

MATT: “Very well! I assume they're staying here as well.”

TALIESIN: Yes. We appreciate it greatly.

MATT: “They'll be taken care of, Percival.”

TALIESIN: They will be well worth your time. We also have something that needs a bit of study. We found something. We found two objects of power that we think may help us turn the table against the dragons.

LAURA: Two objects?

MATT: “This is good news.”

TALIESIN: Two objects.

LAURA: What was the second?

TALIESIN: There was a necklace.

LAURA: There was?

TALIESIN: There was.

SAM: You were dead.

LAURA: Oh. I must have missed it because I was dead. That's right.

MATT: “Dead?!”

TALIESIN: It's been a very long day.

SAM: Mostly dead.

MARISHA: Be very careful when handling this armor, is what we're trying to say.

TRAVIS: Or don't handle it, and we'll take care of it.

MATT: “So, the armor is what killed you?”

LAURA: No, actually, a trap that Percival set off is what killed me.

TALIESIN: Yes, the–

LIAM: What?

TALIESIN: – trap was a bit– it was a bit, ah– there was a trap. And it was well-protected.

LIAM: What?

LAURA: What, what, what? What?

TALIESIN: Yes, what.

LAURA: What?

TRAVIS: (mutters) He didn't know that.

LAURA: What? So these Vestiges.

MATT: “Vestiges.”

LAURA: These leathers, these things.

MATT: “Um–” And he puts a couple of small, armored, like, studded-leather gloves on and has to carefully reach out for the vestments as you hand them. And he grabs them. “Give me a bit of time with them, perhaps, I need to clarify what this enchantment may be. Do you mind staying around, just in case?”

TALIESIN: Not at all.

MATT: “Don't feel strange that I don't trust this, but, based on your history with it, I would like a little backup.” So, he carries you off down the far hallway, you didn't get this far into Whitestone when you initially came through, but towards the back there was a small study area converted into a research establishment largely set up for the ziggurat beneath the city. He clears off an area of the table and sets this down. And he takes some time working with the vestments before he eventually, and it's this awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and bring out a symbol and bring over a minor enchantment to reveal information, that tearing into the divinity, the divine magic that is granted to him, before he says, “This carries the mark of the Raven Queen, a very strong mark. I've not seen power like this in but an object.”

LAURA: It was worn by one of her champions. The great Purvan.

MATT: “That's a strange name.”

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: “Regardless, it appears that this armor does help fortify one's defenses from any sort of physical damage, as well as give you a chance of surviving even the most dangerous of near-death experiences. It also grants a fluid resistance to the elements. Here.” And he hands it over, and– who would like to take this? Item card to–

TRAVIS: Well, you died for it, you–

LAURA: I think I like it, but I'll just look at it.

MARISHA: It's leather?

LAURA: It's leather.

MATT: So, to give you the specifics on it, it's plus two to AC. Magical on top of the studded leather armor. Plus two enchantment, beyond just the studded leather armor. It does give you advantage on death saving throws.

SAM: You'll need that.

MATT: As it is called the Deathwalker's Ward, and once per short rest, you can set it to be resistant to one of the five types of damage.

LAURA: You choose which one.

MATT: You choose. You can change it. You can leave it all on one, but if you want to change it during a short rest, you can shift it from fire or cold, or lightning–

TRAVIS: Acid, or necrotic.

SAM: You're, like, indestructible now!

MARISHA: Do you have fancy leather armor right now? What does your armor do right now? Anything?

LIAM: It's acid-resistant.

LAURA: My armor's acid-resistant, I sort of stole it from my brother. Do you want your acid-resistant armor back, then?

LIAM: Whatever you want, Vex'ahlia.

LAURA: He's in such a sour mood lately.

TRAVIS: Well, yeah. Well, what about the necklace?

MATT: “The necklace as well?”

TALIESIN: I hand it over.

MATT: He takes it, and he goes, “Well, the chain on this necklace is not actually part of the enchantment, it's merely to hold the crystal itself. The crystal is the item of particular interest here, this– oh, wait a minute.” He takes it and he scans over the table and pulls up a jeweler's eyepiece and inspects it closely. “There's something inside this gem.”

TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

MARISHA: (groans) Not again.

LAURA: What is it?

MARISHA: Why do things like living in gems? It can't be comfortable.

TRAVIS: It might be a worm.

LAURA: It's like tequila.

MATT: “I can't actually ascertain the nature of whatever being is encased within this, but–”

LAURA: There's a being, it's a being?

MARISHA: Encased.

LAURA: Is it a soul gem?

MARISHA: Like something put it in there.

MATT: He takes a moment and concentrates on his holy symbol of Pelor, and you can see as he puts aside the eyepiece, his eyes glaze over with a grayish, frosted white color, at which point he inspects the gem very closely, and there's this slight vibration in the air around him. As soon as it fades about a minute later, he pulls back and goes, “This is referred to as the Raven's Slumber. It's actually a small gateway to a tiny pocket-plane.”

SAM: A pocket-plane?

MARISHA: Ooh.

MATT: “It can contain one creature. You have to contact whatever it was, and it can't be too big, but it can essentially contain something indefinitely within this.”

LAURA: But something's already in there?

MATT: “Something is already in this.”

TRAVIS: Awesome.

SAM: Something that we can summon?

MARISHA: Any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it?

MATT: “Unfortunately, I do not have that capability.”

LAURA: It was buried with–

SAM: I'll take that.

LAURA: Oh, that's really smart to give to Scanlan.

TRAVIS: Well, like, you said “not too big” though, right?

MATT: “The confines of the space, at least, as part of the enchantment, seem rather small. A bit larger than you, maybe, but not much more than that.”

TRAVIS: Right, right, okay.

MATT: “Here.”

TRAVIS: Please.

MARISHA: Well, does it change size?

LAURA: This is maybe the worst thing that Scanlan's ever held outside of that gun that you had, Percy.

TRAVIS: What are you talking about? Can we take it in the woods, open it up, and if it sucks we kill it, and if not, we've got a new pet.

MARISHA: We don't even know how to open it up! Do we know how to open it up?

TRAVIS: Oh, we will find a way.

LAURA: It was buried with the Raven Queen's champion, I mean, it could be incredibly dangerous. Or it could be incredibly good, and he trapped it, and they're bad, right?

LIAM: The same could be said about your new pajamas.

LAURA: They are so beautiful. I do like feathers.

TRAVIS: What do they smell like?

LAURA: (sniffs) Like (sniffs) must and mold. And birds, really.

TRAVIS: (laughing) And birds? Eesh.

MATT: “So, is that all you require of me?”

TRAVIS: I require Percy to tell us what the fuck's up with the necklace he's reading about.

TALIESIN: Just what he said.

LAURA: Yeah, he already told us about it.

SAM: Once we release whatever is inside of it, we can use this necklace as a weapon, to–

TALIESIN: It's a cage.

SAM: To trap people.

MARISHA: Hang on, okay. Let's think about this. What do we remember from the great Purvan's story?

LAURA: Well, let me look at my book?

MARISHA: What did he fight?

SAM: I just remember that Purvan's story touched me. Touched me in inappropriate ways.

TRAVIS: (laughing) No, no, no.

LAURA: You know what I like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so it's extra special instead of the regular paper.

MATT: It's legendary.

TALIESIN: Legendary cardstock.

MARISHA: Can we get purple cardstock up in here?

LAURA: I'm talking to Matt, bitches. Okay. I forgot what I was going to say– Oh, my book! My 30-gold book! Does it say anything about what Purvan fought?

MATT: All right! You read through. There were many, many things throughout the war that were fought: entities from the Nine Hells, there was a faction of the Abyss that came in as a third bit of evil in this whole conflict; and while not in alliance against the other forces of chaos, there were many forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby. So the Champion's– there was no specific entity that was his chosen, or at least, what you can ascertain to be a specific being of hatred, although it does speak of Purvan, the Champion of the Raven Queen, keeping with him an ally.

LAURA: Like Trinket.

MATT: It doesn't say the nature of the ally, it just says the dangerous and respected Galdric.

LAURA: (gasps) Galdric.

TALIESIN: Well, there are some options here.

LAURA: What?

TALIESIN: No, that won't work, damn it.

TRAVIS: Well, say it, come on.

TALIESIN: Well, I was thinking we could find a safe place, surround it, let it out, and if it's dangerous, take care of it. We could even take it down into the pits beneath the castle so that if it's a magical creature, it would be harmless. Except I don't know if we could actually release it down there. I don't know–

LAURA: Yeah, what if it touches the thing, and it–

SAM: There's also magic resistance down there.

TALIESIN: Yeah, which means it wouldn't work in the first place.

MARISHA: What if he's friendly? I mean, he talks about being an ally.

TALIESIN: It might be an ally.

MARISHA: Well then, wouldn't we want to save it?

LAURA: An ally of Purvan! An ally of Purvan's!

TALIESIN: Yes.

LAURA: Is Purvan a good guy?

TALIESIN: Yes.

LAURA: I thought the Raven Queen was not good!

TALIESIN: No, the Raven Queen–

MARISHA: She's like– neutral.

TALIESIN: Can I make a roll for this?

MATT: Make a religion check.

TALIESIN: Okay, thank you. Nope, nope, it's St. Patty's Day.

TRAVIS: Don't kill anybody.

LAURA: Yeah, with these green dice.

TALIESIN: Religion or history?

MATT and TRAVIS: Religion.

TALIESIN: 11.

MATT: 11. The general essence of the Raven Queen: she is both loved and feared in equal parts. She does not lord over the afterlife, the underworld, whatever you may call it– she lords over the moment and the transition of death, which is largely considered neither a good nor evil, just a natural force. It could be accepted either way. Many men fear it, and fear her for that reason, and there are those that instead embrace it as the inevitable. As to the true nature of her intent, no one really knows. It's part of her mystique.

TRAVIS: So, like, even if we let out the glorious Ball-lick or whatever his name is, like, if he's bad, we can't really put him back in, right?

TALIESIN: No, we actually can. Actually, we can put him back in.

TRAVIS: What, we touch him with it and he goes back in?

SAM: Correct.

MATT: After a saving throw.

MARISHA: Maybe we should save him and release him when he'll be valuable to us?

TALIESIN: So would a trap. We could also trap other creatures–

LAURA: It's like a Poké Ball! Right? It's like a Pokémon?

TALIESIN: Yes, it's exactly like a Poké Ball.

MARISHA: Who knows if he'll go back in willingly?

TALIESIN: You don't have to go in willingly, that's sort of the point.

MATT: I guess you could technically use it that way, yeah.

MARISHA: But wouldn't we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we release him?

TALIESIN: I'm more excited about the idea of carrying around an empty trap.

MARISHA: But we could win both. But we could have a trap and a friend.

LIAM: I think Percy is right that we should let it out now because it's a question mark, no matter what. Whatever, it's all theories. We don't know what we're getting into, and better that it pop out now, on its own, and not while we're facing a fucking beholder.

LAURA: I think we should do it in the forest outside of Vasselheim.

TALIESIN: Or the forest outside of Whitestone.

SAM: Vasselheim? We're here.

MARISHA: Why don't we try and do a little bit more research on Galdric first?

SAM: That would be too careful.

TRAVIS: Yeah, come on. Come on.

SAM: Vex! Just open it!

LIAM: Percival. Are there any libraries here?

TALIESIN: Not really, anymore.

LIAM: What about a personal collection in your family?

TALIESIN: Didn't they ravage most of our collection?

MATT: Elements have been ravaged. Elements of family history have been destroyed so that there couldn't be large connections, or the end of the bloodline itself being too prominently displayed within the castle itself. There is still a library there, though from your knowledge– and you've read through most of those books growing up– a lot of them are loose history books; a lot of them are more encyclopedia-like, general knowledge–

TALIESIN: She wasn't a revered deity in this part of the world, we don't have a lot–

LAURA: All right, yeah, let's do it. Woods!

TRAVIS: Woods! Woods! Woods!

TALIESIN: Woods, or Vasselheim, that's actually not a bad idea to get far away from Whitestone.

TRAVIS: No, because then somebody else'll come along and kill it.

SAM: Plus they don't like magic.

TALIESIN: This is sort of our secret, and we should perhaps keep this–

LAURA: Okay.

TALIESIN: Well, we were going to go take a look at–

MARISHA: (muffled) What if–

TRAVIS: You got shit in your mouth.

MARISHA: We g– mm, sorry. Little bit of saliva.

LIAM: Goodberries?

MARISHA: Snacks. We go to those goliath caves, right outside of Whitestone, that were abandoned.

TRAVIS: Stone giant caves?

MARISHA: Those!

TRAVIS: Shit. Made me feel like I had to poop for a second, there. Goliath caves, fuck.

MARISHA: Sorry! I just remembered you recognized them. They were empty, and abandoned, we could go there.

TRAVIS: Yeah!

LAURA: Is that close to your family?

TRAVIS: Nope.

MARISHA: No, we saw it on the way into Whitestone.

TALIESIN: It's just a couple hours away, correct?

LAURA: Oh.

MATT: It's, I'd say roughly three, three and a half hours northwest of here.

LAURA: Let's do it!

MATT: Yeah, it's where the forest of the Alabaster Sierras ends and the actual Alabaster Sierra mountain range begins, is where that transitions.

TALIESIN: We can take a day and do this.

LAURA: All right, sure. Let's do it. All right. What do you think? Good idea? Good idea?

LIAM: Sure, yes, yes, yes, Keyleth had a good idea, yes.

MATT: All right. So.

LAURA: We're healed, yes?

TALIESIN: Yes.

MARISHA: We're healed, right? Did we sleep? Do we need to sleep?

LIAM: I thought we rested before we went down under the water, though–

LAURA: No, we did, we didn't rest since then.

LIAM: I don't remember resting afterwards. And I was there.

TRAVIS: I don't either. I remember I peed on a lake, and then we went under it.

MATT: Yeah, I think you guys decided instead of resting to come to rest here in Whitestone.

LAURA: Yeah, we need to sleep, y'all!

TALIESIN: Let's take a sleep, and we'll do it in the morning.

TRAVIS: What time is it, about?

MATT: I'd say by now, with as much time as you spent in the temple, from waking up in the morning, it's getting four in the afternoon, five in the afternoon. The sun's starting to come down, so.

LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

SAM: Aren't we going to sleep?

LAURA: But it's four in the afternoon! There's other things to do today.

MARISHA: Like drink?

LAURA: Like find out how Gilmore's doing and see Pike.

MARISHA: And I should probably scry and check in on Allura, right?

TALIESIN: I've got some work to do.

MATT: It's up to you guys. Yeah, and you're starting to push towards the bottom of your ammunition stack anyway, Percy.

TALIESIN: I need to, yeah, to do a little– and I've got a little thing I want to work on.

MATT: Cool. All right, so, who's doing what first?

TALIESIN: I'm going to take Vax aside very quickly.

TRAVIS: Let's do that first!

TALIESIN: I had a careless moment, and I apologize. And you're the first apology I'm putting forward. I don't know if I would have done anything different, but I hope you know that I would've never forgiven myself.

LIAM: What're you talking about?

TALIESIN: I rushed in and triggered the trap that almost killed your sister.

LIAM: That killed my sister.

TALIESIN: I can't say that.

LIAM: What do you mean?

TALIESIN: I was careless.

LIAM: Well, what happened, Percival?

TALIESIN: I felt the danger had passed, and I moved too quickly, and opened the casket without thinking. That's all. I just didn't think.

LIAM: You just opened it? Just like that?

TALIESIN: I was tired, wasn't thinking. Sometimes we move too quickly. But I want you to know that it would've– I'm very glad that she's alive, because I don't think I could have lived with myself.

LIAM: All right. Could you do me a favor?

TALIESIN: Yes.

LIAM: In the future– If there is anything that your little heart desires inside of a box– In the future, could you check with my sister or myself first?

TALIESIN: That's the hope, yes. That was more of a lesson than I was hoping for. Thankfully not too much of one.

LIAM: Well–

TALIESIN: And none of us are beyond mistakes, but… that is a mistake that I am going to be thinking about for a very long time. We are going into dangerous territory, and we all have to think a little bit more. And she especially, I– I couldn't–

LIAM: Well listen, Percy. We are not playing a game.

TALIESIN: No.

LIAM: And we will all make mistakes, and I wager I will make my fair share. I've little doubt. And Percival, I want to apologize. I'm sorry. But– And I punch him in his know-it-all fucking mouth.

MATT: Do you attempt to move out of the way, or take it?

TALIESIN: Yeah, let's take it.

MATT: All right. (impact sound) Decks you square in the– for as hefty as a punch it was? Doesn't hurt quite as much as you expected. But it's not the physical pain that hurts, more than the action and the knowledge that there are more repercussions to your rash decision than even you initially anticipated.

LIAM: Goodnight, Percival.

TALIESIN: Goodnight, Vax.

SAM: It's four in the afternoon!

(laughter)

TALIESIN: I'm going to work. I'm going into my studio.

MATT: All right, who else wants to do something?

MARISHA: Where'd Kima go?

MATT: Kima is actually– she's begun day-drinking into the night! So yeah, she's currently by herself in one of the few functional taverns in Whitestone. It's fairly empty at the moment, especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets. She's not heavy drinking but she's definitely nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around the tankard. She's staring at her reflection as she spins it slowly on the wood. You can hear it (scuffing) on the woodgrain.

MARISHA: Anyone else want to go to the–

LAURA: I'm going with you, yeah.

MATT: There's like a few other random patrons, but no one catches your eye. No one specifically.

SAM: I'll come, too. Well, actually, wait. Grog, what're you doing?

TRAVIS: Nothing yet.

SAM: I'm with Grog.

MATT: Okay. So the two of you, into the tavern– she doesn't notice you guys.

MARISHA: I go up and put my hand on her shoulder.

MATT: “Keyleth!”

MARISHA: Hey! How's it going?

MATT: “Better.”

MARISHA: Yeah.

LAURA: I lean up against the bar, next to you guys.

MARISHA: Want to check in on Allura?

MATT: “Let's do it.”

MARISHA: Is there an empty room around here?

MATT: She looks over to the barkeep. You all stare over and the barkeep is currently there like wiping down the bar section. “For how long?”

LAURA: For a couple hours.

MARISHA: Doesn't need to be that long.

MATT: “Two silver?”

LAURA: We saved your life? And the entire town.

MATT: “You are fine to use it as you please for the remainder of the afternoon. Just don't mess it up, please.”

MARISHA: Sure. We'll try really hard to find better things to do with our time. Okay.

MATT: All right, you make your way up and the place is fairly vacant, there are a couple of rooms that are currently partially– the doors are ajar and you hear voices in there, and you recognize it's a couple of the refugees that you guys brought over from your keep, currently holed up in this tavern. An inn floor on the second floor. But there are a number of open rooms right now that you could go ahead and step into for use.

MARISHA: Just pick one.

MATT: Okay. So. Do you want to go ahead and attempt a Scry ritual?

MARISHA: Yes!

MATT: Focusing on…?

MARISHA: The flower that I gave her before we left.

LAURA: Ooh, good call.

MATT: All right, so. As you all sit down, Kima sitting across from you, arms closed. She looks at you intensely with this really direct glare, waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or information. As you complete the ritual preparation of the scrying, your vision transcends your form, jettisoned through the ceiling and into the clouds. Clouds rush past, you can feel the wind pushing across your face, your hair, and as the clouds part you see, below, you see Westruun. And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as you recall, and a large portion of it currently looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke, long after a fire or some sort of an impact, lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It focuses even closer, and you see very little populace in the streets. Most everyone's either indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision clicks in once again, and you can see currently some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both gathering a few small books under their arms, silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same energy form you saw that jettisoned out of Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway that you previously didn't see was attached to this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase that goes upward before these two dual sparks travel through the small crack between where the edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten away by some sort of caustic material, their arms and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as the spark comes to a stop for a second in its movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats) and you see rush overhead, wings fully spread, the black dragon that you had briefly encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly, towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue their trek through the streets, and at that point the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the clouds and then thrust back into your current position and with a shock you find yourself back in the tavern.

LAURA: What did you see? Is she all right?

MARISHA: She's alive, her and Drake both are alive.

MATT: “Good. Where are they going?”

MARISHA: They're at the Cobalt Reserve, which is in ruins, as well as the rest of Westruun.

LAURA: Did you see the dragon?

MARISHA: Yes, the black dragon is there. Looks like he's taken up residence in the black spire– tower. What was it called?

LAURA: Gatshadow?

MARISHA: That one.

MARISHA: Gatshadow. Allura–

LAURA: Could you communicate with her when you scry? I don't know how it works.

MARISHA: No, I can just look in and see.

LAURA: All right.

MARISHA: She was grabbing the last few important tomes, remnants left from the Cobalt Library, I mean, Reserve.

MATT: “They staying in Westruun?”

MARISHA: It didn't look like it.

MATT: “Where are they going?”

MARISHA: I don't know, I didn't see.

MATT: “Did you talk about where you–”

LAURA: We left word. And told her we were coming here.

MATT: “Here to Whitestone?”

LAURA: Yes. If you wait, she'll be here.

MATT: “Who else is coming?”

LAURA: Drake.

MATT: “Drake. Anybody else on the Council coming?”

SAM: We brought some Council members, right? Were any among our–

MATT: You're not there, you're with Grog.

SAM: Oh, that's right, I'm sorry, oh, I'm not there!

(laughter)

SAM: So, Grog! Want to play some bocce ball?

(laughter)

MARISHA: I don't know who all's coming.

LAURA: Uriel.

MATT: “Dead? Well, that's great. That's fantastic. What about the rest?”

MARISHA: His wife and children are here.

MATT: “Here, okay.”

MARISHA: As well as Gilmore.

LAURA: Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

MATT: “Right, right.”

LAURA: Wonderful place to buy all sorts of products, if it were still… standing.

MATT: “Huh. I've only heard things, I've not met this 'Gilmore'.”

MARISHA: You haven't met Gilmore!? Man, I just assume everyone knows each other.

MATT: “Anybody else? Tofor?”

LAURA: Yes, maybe…? Yes, Tofor…?

MARISHA: He might have… been… slain…?

LAURA: Which one is Tofor?

MARISHA: She's the dragonborn–

LAURA: Yes, Tofor– they did, I think Tofor is– definitely maybe here.

MATT: Last you heard, two Council members that were confirmed still alive by Gilmore when you found him– or, confirmed by Uriel's wife and family– thank you, sorry, were Tofor and Asum.

LAURA: Yes.

MATT: So both were two of the ones that were saved by Gilmore, and then once he was too wounded to continue, they left to seek for survivors in Emon. That was the last you heard of them.

LAURA: Oh. They're not actually here, then. Yes. They're looking for other survivors, Tofor and Asum.

MATT: “In the place where this– and what's this dragon you keep talking about?”

LAURA: Oh, shit, you don't know anything. Thordak! Big. Terrible. Red.

MATT: As you say the name again, you can see her eyes resonate with a clarity, and where once was this very intense expression and air of demanding information suddenly recedes into this look of sudden fear, and she's briefly lost in thought.

LAURA: Yes, you defeated him once. He escaped the Fire Realm.

MARISHA: Not only did he escape, he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the Fire Realm and ours.

MATT: (sighs deeply) “Thordak.” And you can see, she's starting to hyperventilate suddenly, like, for all of her strong exterior, this is the first time, aside from the brief hit of the beholder's ray earlier, you see fear in her eyes, and she starts standing up. (pants) “I need to get some air.”

MARISHA: Kima, Kima, it'll be–

MATT: “I need to–”

MARISHA: Sit here, you want to sit down?

MATT: “I need to get s– I need to get some air.” And she storms out of the room.

MARISHA: Let's go outside.

LAURA: Actually, Keyleth–

MARISHA: What?

LAURA: I shut the door behind Kima.

MARISHA: Okay.

LAURA: I want to talk to you.

MARISHA: Yeah.

LAURA: I would ask my brother, but, knowing him, he would walk away. What happened?

MARISHA: Keyleth has a hard time looking her in the eye.

LAURA: Look at me, Keyleth! Be strong! You're royalty. Tell me what happened.

MARISHA: Vex, I don't want to ever see you like that again. I don't want to ever see anybody like that again.

LAURA: I grab both sides of her face and force her to look at me. I'm all right. I'm still here. Okay? I need you to tell me what happened. Because between us? Vax is off. Something's wrong. And I need to know what it is.

MARISHA: We all watched you die.

LAURA: Yes.

MARISHA: It's like–

LAURA: How did I get back? Who brought me back? Kashaw, Zahra, my brother. Anyone else?

MARISHA: I guess… you could say, probably an unseen entity, an unseen force. Oh, I'm lightheaded.

LAURA: Sit down.

MARISHA: Okay.

LAURA: There's a bed. Sit down.

MARISHA: Percy–

LAURA: Percy helped.

MARISHA: Let's skip that. When we brought you back, Kashaw performed a resurrection ritual.

LAURA: Like we did with Pike.

MARISHA: Yes. And he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was Vesh. Which he was quite terrified about.

LAURA: His wife.

MARISHA: Yes. That, I don't believe, is the presence that answered his call.

LAURA: Okay. Fluttery words here, darling. Get to the point.

MARISHA: I thought I was going to lose you both. I thought I was going to lose you and Vax.

LAURA: Why Vax? Did he get hurt as well? No. What did he do?

MARISHA: He– I don't know. I don't know what he did. He said to take him instead, is what he told the entity. He offered his life for yours. And my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to come back. He offered his life for you. And for all we know, that offer was accepted.

LAURA: Right.

MARISHA: If I had to guess, it was probably the Raven Queen herself.

LAURA: Well. It's rather suiting, isn't it?

MARISHA: He seems to do that quite a lot.

LAURA: Yes. Keyleth? Thank you, dear. And I leave.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: I stay behind and burst into tears.

MATT: Okay. Grog and Scanlan! What're you guys doing?

(relieved laughter)

LIAM: (Grog voice) Go fish.

TRAVIS: So– what do you want to do?

SAM: I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it. Do you have any games with you?

TRAVIS: No.

SAM: Anything in the Bag of Holding?

TRAVIS: I think there's some orc parts in there that've been in for a couple months.

SAM: Doesn't sound very fun.

TRAVIS: Right. I got all nervous when they mentioned a goliath's cave, so I need to go boom-boom.

SAM: Should I play a song so no one can hear it?

TRAVIS: Might help. Like, stand guard outside the door.

SAM: Yeah, yeah. A little muzak.

TRAVIS: Would you mind?

SAM: It's what I'm here for.

TRAVIS: Can I go drop some ordnance?

MATT: And as you find one of the few local ramshackle outhouses– none are quite goliath-sized, and it's an uncomfortable experience, but thank God you brought a bard along or you would have woken up half the populace just going to bed, as Scanlan, I–

SAM: Nothing to see here, everybody! (plays random chords on the harmonica) Nothing to see here!

TRAVIS: (coughs, then farts) Oh!

LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Now, the music's playing, right?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: It's just a stall, just me?

MATT: Yeah, yeah.

TRAVIS: All right, can I take out Craven Edge?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: All right.

MARISHA: In the outhouse? Sorry, keep going!

TRAVIS: It's the palace, this is where all the best thoughts and conversations happen! I don't know how it is at your house.

LIAM: Keep in mind how confined it is, okay?

TRAVIS: Yeah!

LIAM: And go.

(laughter)

MATT: Yes. (grunting)

SAM: Sounds like a rough one in there, buddy!

MATT: As you (chuckles) as you see one of the wood boards splinter out the side for a second–

SAM: Ah, yup, that's tacos!

TRAVIS: You might want to play a bit louder and maybe take a few steps away, it's about to get violent.

SAM: No problem!

TRAVIS: Yep.

MATT: At that moment you focus, and as you can feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips, you can see what little bit of light that filters through the bright orangish-red color that's coming from the sunset, you can see a reflection in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear and says, “You fed me well.”

TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, right? I mean, we are really doing well. Question: so, when we were fighting that big Earthbreaker Groot-looking guy, he called you a 'dark weapon'. Does that– do you have feelings, and did that hurt them?

MATT: There's a brief pause before you hear this long, drawn-out, (heavy sigh).

TRAVIS: Right, hold on! No, no, listen. And I take my thumb and I run it against the blade real quick.

MATT: Okay. As you do, all of a sudden the voice goes, (gasp, contented exhale).

TRAVIS: Right, yep, sorry, listen. So, my question is, as much as I love opening up people to feed you, I want to know, like– what's in it for you?

SAM: Grog, are you talking to your shit?

TRAVIS: Yeah, no, you got to let it know who's boss!

SAM: Okay.

MATT: The voice creeps in again, this time. “There is no feeling more terrifying than hunger. And I hunger forever. You help satiate that hunger. That is our arrangement. I give you the strength of those you cut down, and I feed upon them. If this is unsatisfactory, I can and have found others who are more willing to be part of this arrangement–”

TRAVIS: No, no, no, I'm a big fan, really, I mean, I am yoked out when I'm using you, it's fucking amazing. I mean, people are flying apart, it's like a dream. But listen, can you ever be… full?

MATT: “I have never been full before. Perhaps you're the one to find out.”

TRAVIS: I'll bet I am, actually, you're really lucky you found me and not these other blokes, not even half the man I am. But listen, so, there's no, like, endgame, just to be clear, you just want to drink and drink, 'cause I've seen the blood, right? And usually I wipe it off, but you, like, suck it in, and that's a little unsettling, not going to lie.

MATT: “My hunger grows, but the air tarnishes my blade. Perhaps we can continue this conversation elsewhere.”

TRAVIS: (farts) Right, yeah, right. Not even a problem. Well, look, I like the way you cut people open, so we'll continue this another time. And I sheathe him.

MATT: All right. As you sheathe, the last thing he says is, “Don't forget: I hunger always.”

TRAVIS: I kick the door open, and I'm like, if you're within 200 feet, back up!

SAM: No one's out here, Grog.

TRAVIS: Oh.

SAM: Just me. Are you all right?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

SAM: I heard you say something about blood.

TRAVIS: Yeah, no, am I sweating? It was a real workout, that one.

SAM: At some point you said, “Are you full?” Are you talking about– did you fill it all the way up?

TRAVIS: Yeah, the privy, you know, it was starting to give my bum a tickle.

SAM: Wow!

TRAVIS: Yeah.

SAM: You topped it off!

TRAVIS: Yeah. Because, you know, you don't want to, like, dip in the muck, it's, you know–

LAURA: Foul.

SAM: Not at all.

TRAVIS: Did you want to–

SAM: I think I'm good.

TRAVIS: Are you sure? I warmed it up for you, it's, like, ready to go.

SAM: I love a good deuce, but not today, I think.

TRAVIS: All right. Fair enough. But I'm feeling so, like, vacated–

SAM: We should go get a bite.

TRAVIS: I think you're right!

SAM: (laughs) All right, let's go.

TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay.

MATT: Okay. You guys are getting a bite. Percival, if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check with dexterity modifier to create more ammunition.

TALIESIN: Tinkering check with dexterity modifier?

MATT: Yes.

TALIESIN: Okay.

MATT: Should be plus 11.

TALIESIN: 16.

MATT: 16, okay. We'll say, in the time that you've had here, with the materials you purchased, and Whitestone's pretty open to supplying you–

TALIESIN: I've got a thing.

MATT: Yeah, I'd say you're able to create roughly 40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have.

TALIESIN: Do I have time to poke at a modification to the explosive arrow? I want to try and build a rock breaker. I'm curious to try and build an arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors.

MATT: Like a siege arrow?

TALIESIN: A light form of siege arrow. Basically, I want to have a tip that actually manages to breach stone and then an explosion that goes outwards, so it's a shattering arrow.

MATT: All right, this'll take the remainder of your evening. You're not going to be able to do much else after this.

TALIESIN: I have nothing else to do.

MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a tinkering check with your intelligence modifier.

TALIESIN: Okay. So… That's 23.

MATT: 23, okay. At the cost of roughly 150 gold pieces, as you have to go through a few different attempts to finally get the design right, and the metalworking you have here is not perfected. You're not at your workshop back at the keep, unfortunately, so you have to work with whatever you have here, and nothing here is designed for the–

TALIESIN: No, I've got an okay workshop here.

MATT: Yeah. The one that you used before, previously, but that's from mostly discarded and– in the time that you've been gone, it's been cannibalized for a lot of different uses. But it's makeshift. You manage to complete what you think could function. You're not entirely certain as to what the final effect will be, but it all seems to be in place.

TALIESIN: All right.

MATT: So you can write down 'Explosive Siege Arrow'.

TALIESIN: Siege arrow.

MATT: And we shall find out in time what it does.

MARISHA: Siege arrow. That's fun.

TALIESIN: A few things I've been working on, and that's one of them.

MATT: So. Are you guys resting for the evening? Anything else you wish to accomplish?

LAURA: That would probably be smart. I'm pretty tired after dying, so I'm going to go to sleep.

MATT: Okay. Vax, anything you want to accomplish before you–

TALIESIN: God, the guilt. Okay. Yeah.

SAM: Can I buy a torch somewhere? Just a torch?

MATT: Sure! Yeah, torches are relatively easy to find. You want to try one?

SAM: Three.

MATT: Three torches. That's three copper.

LAURA: I bring Trinket into the castle with me, just so you know.

MATT: After all this has happened, Trinket has been, like, almost locked to you. Even you going upstairs into the tavern, Trinket was like, (plaintive bear noises) stayed out front, 'cause Trinket's learned at this point, you can't really go into all the taverns.

LAURA: It's hard, it's hard.

MATT: It's rough, being a bear.

SAM: And wherever we're eating, does it happen to be near Jameson the painter's workshop?

MATT: No, but it's about a 20-minute walk, if you wanted to go find him.

SAM: Be nice to check in with him. Grog, do you mind walking with me?

TRAVIS: Absolutely not.

SAM: All right, so we'll truck on over to Jameson's.

MATT: Okay. You head up to it, and this gentleman is a painter as well as a stablehand, so you find your way to the facility, knock on it, and immediately as the door opens, the smell of fresh manure hits your nose and Jameson steps out. “Can I– you!”

SAM: Yes! Hi!

MATT: “Hi!”

SAM: I've come back.

MATT: “I meant to deliver, but they told me not to, because apparently it's not there anymore?”

SAM: The town, you mean.

MATT: “Town, yeah, where I was supposed to deliver it to you.”

SAM: It was wise of you to keep this precious artifact here, because it would've surely been destroyed en route or when it arrived–

MATT: “It's just the canvas, I don't have a– It's a bit too large for my specifications of framing, but–”

SAM: I'm sure it's huge. Did you finish it?

MATT: “Yes, yes! Come, come!”

SAM: Can I look?

TRAVIS: Oh please, oh please!

SAM: (laughing) Okay, let's go look!

MATT: He takes one of the hooded lanterns and turns up the oil wick on it, and as he turns away he brings you into the back stable area where it's been sectioned off, and you can see there's paints that have been dropped all across the ground and the hay, it's this multicolored spattering, this rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor, and there in all of its glory, stretched across and nailed at the corners to this far, far wall, you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills and treelines rising up at the edges. You can see a mountainscape in the distance. The lighting he uses is magnificent. You can see why many people in the city specifically requested that you go to this gentleman. There atop this fantastic green hilltop, you see on this fine white and grey steed as it raises up, hooves in the air, is yourself, shirt open, chest slightly fuzzy and muscular. As you look off, your hair blowing in the breeze–

SAM: How's the face? How's the face?

MATT: The face is pretty damn spot-on.

SAM: Yes!

(laughter)

MATT: The best likeness you can find for somebody who only had a brief reference, as he sketched you quickly before he left, and there behind, clutching you, from the side you can see Pike wearing these long greyish-silver and blue robes that are also flowing behind, a long train– longer than it needs to be, stylistically it was a choice in the artistic point of this– it is everything you hoped it would be. You paid good money for this piece.

SAM: I'm going to request– Grog, I need a minute here.

TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. I understand, take–

SAM: Just to weep.

TRAVIS: Take all the time you need.

SAM: So I regard it for a few minutes, taking in the beauty and the wonder of all I've accomplished–

MARISHA: I have a question. Would Keyleth and Scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time?

MATT: Right now? Yes. For different reasons entirely.

SAM and TALIESIN: (singing) Somewhere out there…

TRAVIS: Look at the air, look at the air high-five. There it is.

SAM, TALIESIN and MARISHA: (singing) Beneath the pale moonlight

TRAVIS: So white. That was the whitest of white high fives ever.

TALIESIN: I'm imagining this as a canvas of Lisa Frank majesty, by the way. Like, the greatest Lisa Frank Trapper Keeper cover in all the land.

MATT: Oh, man.

(laughter)

SAM: After I weep for a few minutes, I thank Jameson again and how much did I pay him for this thing? You've gone above and beyond, Jameson, and I know that you're a humble man and you don't want me to spread word of your accomplishments, but please allow me to write you an epic poem or a song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents, please.

MATT: “That would be a fine tip, sir. Please, yes, do so.”

SAM: I'll get right on it.

MATT: “Send them back to Whitestone, please, ask for Jameson. The more I work this, hopefully I can make my way out of this dunghole.”

SAM: Don't worry, you'll have lots of commissions after this, I promise you.

MATT: “Great.”

SAM: And I'm going to give him an extra 50 gold.

MATT: “I, um–”

LIAM: That's more than the price of a book.

MATT: “Sir, I– thank you. Thank you, thank you.”

SAM: For art supplies to get your shop up and running.

MATT: “Of course.” He looks down and he's gotten a little bit of paint on the coins, he's like, (muttering and stammering). He puts it aside somewhere. “Thank you–” Wipes his hands off on a nearby rag. “Thank you.” And takes your hand and shakes it vigorously.

SAM: So, can it be–

MATT: Yeah, he goes in and he takes his little claw hammer down, starts pulling the nails out from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas. It takes a good, like, three minutes to roll the thing up, and it's quite heavy as he hands it over to you– (heavy grunt) In your hand, yeah, it almost takes you off your feet.

SAM: Grog! Grog!

TRAVIS: What?

SAM: Can you hold this for me?

TRAVIS: No, it's you, I mean, you're so magnificent in it–

SAM: No, I can't do it.

TRAVIS: I don't know it– I really–

SAM: Grog! I watched you shit for an hour!

TRAVIS: Hey, all right, I'll pick it up.

MATT: All right. You guys find your way out. At this point night has taken; you can hear the crickets starting to spread throughout the city. As the rest of the blue night sky takes on– Evening is ready, do you guys have anything else to accomplish before the evening comes to a close?

LIAM: Wait 'til it's quiet. And I leave the room that I've been given at Whitestone. And I find my sister's door. And I stand outside it, and I stare at it for a minute–

LAURA: Vax? Is that you?

LIAM: And I stealth away.

LAURA: I open the door.

MATT: Roll a stealth check, roll a perception check.

LAURA: Shit.

LIAM: 25.

LAURA: 22. Damn it.

MATT: Nothing to be seen. Must have been your imagination, Vex.

TRAVIS: He's good.

LIAM: And I wait for the door to close. And then I walk to Keyleth's door. And I knock.

MATT: You hear a knock at your door.

LAURA: And horses.

MATT: The clomping of horse hooves in the distance, apparently.

MARISHA: I open it. Hey. Hi. You okay?

LIAM: I don't know.

MARISHA: Come in. Sit down.

LIAM: I go in.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: How do you feel?

LIAM: I don't know. All I know is… that I felt her. I don't know magic, I don't know anything. I open doors, and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction, sometimes, I think. I don't know what happened, but I felt her.

MARISHA: Do you still feel her?

MATT: Make a perception check, Vax.

LIAM: 22.

MATT: As you're sitting there, looking down at the ground, as she asks this question, you notice the symbol of Sarenrae that you have stitched into the back of your glove, what was once a very vibrant, goldish-brass color has actually very heavily tarnished, and the metal itself seems to have cracked in three places. It was not this way a day before.

LIAM: Yeah. I don't know if I did anything in there, and I wouldn't take it back if I did, but I don't know what I'm doing.

MARISHA: I don't know if it was very noble or very stupid, to be honest. Probably a little bit of both. I can attempt a Greater Restoration spell, and see if I can sense anything.

LIAM: I don't know anything about any of that. I'll let you.

MARISHA: Can I?

MATT: Yeah. So as you prepare your mindset for the cleansing ritual that is the Greater Restoration–

MARISHA: Just lay back.

MATT: As soon as the dull green energy begins to course across your fingertips, and as you touch the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with the cleansing energy, it courses through his shoulders, the spell completes. You sense no difference in your current physicality, mindset, and there's this pause, this silence, of no realization, that is suddenly shattered by the sound of a (caws). You look over and at the stone edge of the window you guys are staying in, you see stepping there a single dark raven, (clicks, rapid flapping) and it takes off and flies into the night.

MARISHA: I think this goes beyond any natural realm that I have any bearing over. And I hug him. I thought I was going to lose you. And I'm terrified I'm still going to.

LIAM: Keyleth, I love you.

MARISHA: And I think I love you. I just don't know if I can allow myself to. I'm terrified to allow myself to. You do realize that, if by some crazy chance, we all somehow make it through this domination alive, with the Chroma Conclave, and I complete my Aramente, I'll still watch all of you die. Everything could go phenomenally well. And by becoming Headmaster, we enter a bit of a realm of immortality where I could live for a very, very long time. I'm afraid every time I look at one of your faces that it's going to be the last, and I feel like deep down I know that day is coming. So because of that I'm afraid to let myself feel anything deeper than I already do.

LIAM: I quickly leave her room.

MATT: The door closes behind Vax.

MARISHA: And for the second time today Keyleth bursts into tears. Why do people keep leaving me in rooms alone?

MATT: All right.

TALIESIN: Stop it, you're wasting water.

MARISHA: We're in a drought, god damn it!

LAURA: When was the last time you showered, Keyleth?

MARISHA: It's been a while.

TALIESIN: Makeup's runny.

LIAM: Go water elemental.

MATT: It's the only way. All right, as you all find yourself coming to rest for the evening, some of you easier than others, eventually you get your full rest. Those who heal up to, say, full hit points for a good night's rest here, get your hit dice back, so not a whole lot were spent.

TRAVIS: I lose my strength bonuses.

MATT: Morning comes to you all, and– yes?

LIAM: Sorry, just one detail. From there, I went and fell asleep in this idiot's doorway.

MATT: Okay. All right. We will go ahead and take a quick break, we will see you guys back here shortly to see what is in store for Vox Machina. So we'll be back here in a minute.
Break

[break]
Part II

LIAM: Matt, shit on my face.

MATT: Welcome back, everybody!

SAM: It's too close!

LAURA: They caught it, that one caught it.

MATT: That was pretty close.

LIAM: All they heard was “ace.”

MATT: It's all good. Welcome back, guys. We're going to go ahead and jump back in. So as you all, after that, for some, emotional evening, whether that be conversational emotion or, you know, having to go drop an emotional deuce. You know, that's important. You find yourselves waking up to a fresh morning in Whitestone, hints of blue sky breaking through the cloud coverage, and that's rare for this area because it's the northern portion of the continent, you know that, especially being so close to the ocean, a lot of the cloud, heavy precipitation makes its way in the direction of your town, so it's nice to have a little break in that. Nonetheless, as you guys come to consciousness and gather yourselves, your things, and your plans for the day, what do you wish to do?

TALIESIN: We are a city of seasonal affectation disorder, so.

LAURA: Well, I open my door and find my brother falling through it.

LIAM: I'm awake.

LAURA: Oh, good morning.

LIAM: Hi.

LAURA: Comfortable bed, I see.

LIAM: Yeah. Sorry, I couldn't find my room.

LAURA: Yeah, it's confusing, all these, all these doors.

LIAM: What time's it?

LAURA: I have no idea. My nature check tells me it's roughly, I dunno, eight? Nine? Something like that. Seven? Maybe seven.

LIAM: Come here, you shithead. Don't fucking do that again.

LAURA: It's not like I did it on–

LIAM: Don't fucking do that again, all right? Just don't fucking do it again.

LAURA: All right.

LIAM: Fuck.

LAURA: I can't breathe. You're about to kill me again.

LIAM: You'll live, you'll live. Jesus. Whoever that is.

LAURA: So– (laughs) I heard a rumor that you sort of saved my life in a really creepy sort of way. I talk to people. I talk to so many people. I find out things. Secrets aren't safe when Vex is around.

LIAM: Is there any coffee in this fucking castle?

LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, I have a present for you, because I feel like you're going to really like it. Would you like it?

LIAM: That's random. All right.

LAURA: I have this armor that I think would be really great on you. Do you want it? It's really expensive. If you don't take it quickly, I might change my mi–

LIAM: I don't want it.

LAURA: Oh, that was expensive cardstock.

(laughter)

LIAM: I'll give you the leather armor after I have a chance to change.

LAURA: All right. I love you.

LIAM: (softly) I know. I know.

LAURA: Let's get breakfast.

LIAM: Yeah.

MATT: From that point, the smell of coffee begins to fill the air from the inside of the Whitestone castle halls. The servants have prepared breakfast, and a meal is ready for you. Grog jumping to attention as the scent reaches your nose. The rest of you all slowly find your way back down. You eat–

MARISHA: Do we come out and see Vax in the armor?

MATT: Are you putting on the armor?

LIAM: I'm just looking at it in the hallway.

MARISHA: So I guess I step out and see him looking at it in the hallway.

LIAM: Still pretty tired, to be honest. Didn't sleep a lot in the doorway.

MATT: Yeah. Some of you guys step out, and you see Vax standing in the hallway, clutching in his hands, looking over all the various, like, pushed-in, engraved runes across the leatherwork, the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the mantle.

LAURA: Careful, it smells a lot like must and mold and birds.

MARISHA: I walk by and… briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: Oh shit, you got the armor now?

LAURA: He stole it, what can I say? He is a really sneaky, stealthy kind of guy.

TRAVIS: Nice.

LAURA: Yeah. Fair and square.

LIAM: I just took it for fashion purposes, I suppose.

TRAVIS: Oh, you need all the help you can get.

LIAM: Yeah.

SAM: Should we go out in the woods and unleash an undead beast that will kill us all?

TRAVIS: Yes! Christmas morning! Who has that, by the way?

SAM: I do.

TRAVIS: Oh! Yeah!

SAM: Don't worry, it's safe.

TRAVIS: Where d'you keep it?

SAM: Oh! Hold on– Got a pouch or some– you know what? It's back in my room.

MATT: All right. You go retrieve it.

SAM: Got it!

TRAVIS: Where's Percy?

LAURA: Where's Pike? We should bring her with us. Can we bring Pike with us? I know she's taking care of Gilmore, but.

SAM: Mm, that's possibly more important. I think this thing'll be fine!

LAURA: We need some sort of somebody that can heal, I think we've learned this for ourselves.

SAM: I can heal!

TRAVIS: Yeah, we got potions, we're fine. It's probably, like, a big Saint Bernard. What's the big deal?

LAURA: (sighs) Okay. We learn nothing, carry on.

TRAVIS: Where's Percy?

TALIESIN: I'm right here.

TRAVIS: Oh! Shit, you were quiet. Hello.

TALIESIN: (coughs) Hello. Good morning.

TRAVIS: Need any coffee? An enema?

TALIESIN: What?

MARISHA: A coffee enema?

TALIESIN: What!? No. I'm fine. Good morning.

LIAM: I'm going to walk off with this shit.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: And we go outside with the necklace.

SAM: Yeah, where're we headed?

TRAVIS: The woods!

LAURA: No. The caves. I thought we were going to the–

MARISHA: Going to the caves on the edge of the woods.

MATT: Yeah. It's the caves that are–

MARISHA: Going to go through the woods.

LIAM: (sings) Into the woods!

MATT: So. You all gather together and make your way northwest of Whitestone, towards where you found the stone giant fortress and the series of caves that are in the mountain behind it. You get there; it's still seemingly abandoned. You case the area for a while. No noticeable movement other than a few woodland entities that exist in that vicinity.

LAURA: Primeval Awareness! (radar sounds)

MATT: Okay. That is now the sound it makes every time you do it.

LAURA: I like it.

MATT: Yeah, so hold onto that one. I'll make that a new ringtone sound for you guys. What are you looking for?

LAURA: Oh, there's so many things I could sense!

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: What about sirens?

LAURA: Sirens?

TRAVIS: Wait, what are those things called? The things that took our horses the last time we were here?

MATT: Harpies?

TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

LAURA: Sure! Harpies.

MATT: For how many miles is it?

LAURA: Six miles!

MATT: Six miles? Yeah, there's a few blips on the far, far western side of here. You get the essence way off in the mountains, there's maybe a small nest. Nothing that's immediately dangerous.

LAURA: What about if I sit for one more minute and I think if I can sense any giants.

MATT: You do, to the far, far north. You get the sense that there is some sort of giant-based lifeform maybe two, three miles north of you.

LAURA: Okay.

TRAVIS: How's it look?

LAURA: Well, I mean, clear of the things I checked for. No giants.

TRAVIS: Sweet! Let's go! Up to the cave!

MATT: All right. So the fortress or the caves behind it?

TRAVIS: Fortress or cave?

LAURA: Were they both empty? I don't remember.

TALIESIN: Everything was empty, if I recall.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Small space.

TALIESIN: Let's do the caves.

LAURA: All right, sure. Cave.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Cave.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: Oh, if we stick to the woods, it's my favored terrain. If we go into a cave, not as much.

SAM: The caves would contain it. It can't fly away or anything.

TRAVIS: So is it like, cave-fortress, are they same level? I can't remember.

MATT: It's a pathway that leads up into a small ravine in the mountain pass where you guys originally walked down into Whitestone. Up against the north side of where the mountain meets that ravine, there's a big stone fortress that is built into the side of the mountain, and then around that are a series of smaller caves.

LIAM: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.

TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go to this fortress, then we got more room to move in case it does suck.

SAM: All right, fine, fortress.

MATT: You guys find your way inside, the cold morning air still has encompassed the stone floor itself, you can see there are still the scattered and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in the far corner, you still see the splatters of blood that have turned black and cracked as it dried. No corpses here, as the corpses were retooled by the Briarwoods while they were in control. The fortress other than that is still empty, and seemingly untouched since you last left it.

SAM: All right, well, I'm just going to do it then!

LAURA and MARISHA: Wait wait wait!

MARISHA: Wait, there's doors open to the cave, right?

SAM and TALIESIN: We're in a fortress.

MARISHA: Fortress. Whatever.

MATT: (laughs) Coffee's just starting to kick in for you guys.

LAURA: Just barely! Do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast, to make us cooler?

MARISHA: Should I throw a wall up?

SAM: A wall for what?

MARISHA: Do I need to bar the entrance? Or are there doors?

TALIESIN: Vex, by the way–

MATT: There are doors, but they're partially ajar where you left them.

LAURA: Aww, put it on, it's useful!

LIAM: No. We're not having this conversation.

TALIESIN: Vex, by the way, I've got something for you.

LAURA: What? Yes, dear?

TALIESIN: And I pull out the arrow.

LAURA: What is this?

TALIESIN: This is an evening of unbridled guilt. Come here, let me show you. In theory, this is a siege arrow.

LAURA: Okay.

TALIESIN: Shattering stone, shattering doors, breaking things that should not be broken.

LAURA: Breaking hearts left and right?

TALIESIN: If that is what you're after. It should work! Never forget you're my favorite, and I'm so sorry.

LAURA: I kiss him on the cheek. Thank you, Percy.

TALIESIN: That was much nicer than your brother.

LAURA: Is that a black eye?

TALIESIN: (stammering) I didn't sleep.

LAURA: Huh. This is lovely, I can't wait to use it.

TALIESIN: There'll be more.

SAM: All right, in three, two–

TRAVIS: Wait hold on, hold on hold on!

TALIESIN: In a circle! Aim it into the center of the circle.

LIAM: And is it three-two-one, three-two-one-do it, or three-two-one and go,

SAM: On the one. On one.

TALIESIN: It's Jenga, one one-thousand two one-thousand three one-thousand four one-thousand.

SAM: Should one of us leave the room in case it comes out and paralyzes all of us? Just going to throw that out there.

TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we should, what do you call it, spread out?

LAURA: Yeah, definitely, let's all surround it and make sure we're not all clumped up.

TALIESIN: If only someone had armor that could make them immune to paralysis.

LIAM: That's not a bad idea, you get controlled by things. Maybe you could wait just a little bit further back?

LAURA: This was somebody's pet, all right? It's probably not smart enough to take control of our minds.

LIAM: That's a big if.

TRAVIS: I don't mind stepping out, but I would like to be able to see.

LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah!

LIAM: Yeah! We won't shut the door, I just want you outside of any potential blast radius.

TALIESIN: Let's spread out in a circle; we'll let it loose in the center, that way it can't even see all of us.

LAURA: All right, I like it. It only gets to see Scanlan.

SAM: It can see me.

LAURA: I'm going to stealth.

SAM: Well, when a thing is born, it latches on to the first thing it sees, like its mama.

LIAM: Yes, we're going to hide.

MATT: All right, stealth check from both of you guys?

MARISHA: So we're going to try and talk to it?

LAURA: Yeah, Scanlan's going to talk to it.

MARISHA: Scanlan? You prepared?

LAURA: Natural 20!

TALIESIN: You just teleport, there's like a phase effect.

MATT: The two of you back off and find the nearby shaded corners, where some of the haphazardly tossed hides and furs are in the corner, you vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch.

LAURA: Trinket, don't stand next to me, it gives it away. Go stand next to Keyleth!

TRAVIS: Is there a doorway in the fortress?

MATT: Yeah, there's the main doorway you guys entered, which is two–

TRAVIS: Can I stand in that, then?

MATT: Sure, you stand there, in the entranceway that's pushed open, which is wide enough for a giant to push through. You got a little bit of room to each side, but you're there.

TRAVIS: Vax, is this g– Vax?

TALIESIN: It's fine, you're fine.

SAM: Here we go, guys.

MARISHA: So, those two are stealthed– I'm at Scanlan's left shoulder, back a bit.

LAURA: And Trinket's next to you!

MARISHA: And Trinket's next to me. I'm rolling with Trinket.

TALIESIN: I've got a little bit of distance, yes, that's good.

MATT: All righty, and there's Percy here, and Travis is off this way. Good to know.

SAM: I don't know how to use this thing.

MARISHA: Yeah, we don't know how to use it.

SAM: By the power of Raven's Slumber, I command thee: (yells) awaken! Beast! Cruel or otherwise! Face your new master, and know his name is Scanlan!

(laughter)

TRAVIS: (laughing) Oh, holy shit! Never could've been better.

MATT: As you spend your bonus action to release the gate hold on the crystal, you guys see as he thrusts his hands forward, there's a burst of shadow energy that, almost like someone throwing a big pot of water, this blackness goes out of it, and then as it hits the ground, it spills into smoke on the ground, and as that dark form stops, it is in the form of an about waist-to-lower-torso-height creature. As the form coalesces into its normal self, you can see before you, shaking its head, a rather large, dark grey and black wolf. (growls, snarls)

SAM: Easy, easy.

TRAVIS: Told you it was a dog.

SAM: Garlic? Galdric, Galdric, easy, Galdric. Easy. We're friends. Here.

MATT: He's backing up a little bit, snarling. You see Trinket starts growling, (growls).

LAURA: Trinket, be nice– oh!

MATT: As you say that (snarls) it looks over at you in the far corner.

LAURA: (whispers) I'm natural 20! That still didn't see me!

MARISHA: I pet Trinket, like, 'Chill, chill, be cool'.

MATT: Trinket backs up a little bit, but still locking eyes. You can see this wolf now, its gums and teeth are bared, its fur is all puffed up, its tail is– it's definitely holding its ground and trying to make itself look as intimidating as possible.

SAM: Is it a small beast?

MATT: This would be, technically, borderline medium. This'd be medium, technically.

SAM: I can only speak with small beasts.

MARISHA: Wait, use Speak with Animals?

LIAM: (laughs) She swatted me and said, 'Put your armor on,' so I'm doing it.

MATT: Okay. That'll take you about 15 minutes.

LAURA: Aw.

LIAM: 15 minutes! Well, guess I'm doing it.

MATT: All right. You don't just slip on leather armor. (chuckles)

LIAM: No, I get that, I get that, I would've guessed two minutes.

TRAVIS: Can somebody check to see if it's actually a wolf or just looks like one? Like, check it?

LAURA: Can I use my perception?

MATT: You're a bit far away from it right now. You can try to get closer if you want.

LAURA: Can I sneak?

MATT: Yeah, make another stealth check.

LAURA: I do get advantage, because of my cloak. Sweet.

LIAM: You should yell out, 'I'm stealthing'.

LAURA: I'm stealthing! Damn it. 19?

MATT: Okay. As you begin making your way forward, it doesn't seem to notice you.

LAURA: Hey, it doesn't?

MATT: No.

LAURA: Can I see it better now to perceive it?

MATT: Looking right at it, and from your experience in the wild as well, and Keyleth, you're getting it, this does not appear to be anything beyond a large wolf.

TALIESIN: I'm going to get on my knees and put out my hand and call it. Galdric, Galdric.

MATT: Go ahead and make an animal handling check.

SAM: Animal handling! We've never done that before!

LAURA: If I help my brother get on the armor, will it happen faster?

MATT: Probably.

LAURA: I help him put on the armor.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: (whispering) Ow ow ow! That's too tight!

LAURA: Well, you're not the same size as the other guy!

TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a little bit better. Ten.

MATT: Ten. As you put out your hand, Galdric snarls, and as you say, “Here, boy.” (growls and snaps) It lashes out at your hand. That is going to be– That's a 21 to hit?

TALIESIN: I'll take it.

TRAVIS: Keyleth, can't you talk to, like, plants and shit?

MATT: You take six points of piercing damage as its jaws clench down on your hand, and you tear your hand away. You can feel the warmth flowing under the glove.

TALIESIN: Gently, I'm gentle with it.

MARISHA: I cast Speak with Animals.

LIAM: I click my Boots of Haste!

MATT: You do?

SAM: Aren't you getting dressed?

LAURA: He can dress faster!

TRAVIS: Speed change.

MATT: All right.

TRAVIS: Quick change.

SAM: Seven-and-a-half minutes!

(laughter)

MATT: You guys all become immediately aware of the creaking of leather in the distance as the two siblings are in the process of fast-changing one of the other.

LAURA: The rustle of feathers.

MARISHA: Okay, I cast Speak with Animals. And I crouch down to the ground. And bow down a little bit, and I say: are you the one they call Galdric?

MATT: Looks over at you for a second. The growl stops, and its posture changes a little bit. It raises its nose. (sniffs)

MARISHA: Was Purvan your master?

MATT: Looking at you as you guys hear Keyleth making this series of growling sounds.

LAURA: Trinket totally understands you, no?

MATT: Strangely enough, Trinket does, Trinket's like, (confused bear noise).

TALIESIN: Trinket is Scooby-Doo, apparently.

TRAVIS: Shitballs! Taint! You going that way?

MARISHA: Oh my god, I get a secret!

SAM: There are several items that are sold out at the store! If you'd like to go on and see what items have already sold out, check it out.

(laughs)

LAURA: We need to get more t-shirts in stock.

SAM: Yeah, we know that. We know that, guys. We know.

LAURA: That needs to happen. But there is still the Critical Role logo t-shirt available. What is happening? What is he–

SAM: Is there a ring or something?

LAURA: Is the ring still available?

SAM: I don't know.

LAURA: If the ring is still available, check out our ring!

MARISHA: I can respond back, right? Your master died a great champion for the Raven Queen. He has been paid a great honor, and now the Raven Queen has chosen a new master.

LAURA: I push Vax forward.

MATT: You've gotten maybe part of the tunic on.

(laughter)

SAM: Is he Donald-Duck-ing it right now?

MATT: Practically. There are undergarments, but not much. It's, like, bare legs and knees, part of an arm. Yeah, he got thrust out of the changing room about 20 seconds into it.

SAM: Nice.

LIAM: I still walk toward the wolf.

TALIESIN: Waddle.

LIAM: No no no, I did the top, I did the top, c'mon!

MATT: The wolf turns his head a little bit curiously.

MARISHA: I continue to speak to the wolf.

LIAM: And I kneel. And bow my head.

MARISHA: A great darkness has fallen upon our lands. Upon Othanzia. We could use all of the assistance that we can achieve. Would you be willing to find a new purpose? Join Vax'ildan–

LIAM: Keyleth?

MARISHA: Yes?

LIAM: Tell him to come forward and look into my eyes.

LAURA: (whispers) That's a bad idea for dogs.

LIAM: Tell him.

LAURA: (whispers) It's gonna bite your face off.

MARISHA: Galdric. Please. Approach your new master and look into his eyes.

LAURA: Give him some chocolate, man!

MATT: The wolf looks towards you, looks towards the loosely half-dressed half-elf.

MARISHA: Look into his eyes. I said look into his eyes. And see the touch of the Raven Queen inside of him.

MATT: Wolf slowly stalks towards you across the stone floor. You can hear the claws of the wolf clattering against the stonework. As you can see it's partially, like, digging into the stonework with each step. It has purpose with each stride.

LIAM: As it's coming, I'm taking daggers out and throwing 'em on the ground.

MATT: The wolf stops and looks up at you. Turns around and walks towards the doorway where you are.

SAM: Where who is?

MATT: Where Grog is. Grog, who's now at the door, at the exit.

LAURA: (whispers) What's his name?

TALIESIN and MARISHA: Galdric.

MARISHA: Galdric!

MATT: Keeps walking.

LAURA: Galdric!

SAM: Going to stop him, Grog?

TRAVIS: Well, I'm in the doorway.

MARISHA: Grog, don't move. Don't move. Look at the dog. Don't move, and don't hurt the dog. Please just look at the dog.

LAURA: I pull out one of my treats I have for Trinket.

MATT: Okay. Trinket starts lumbering up towards you (thudding).

LAURA: Wait, wait, Trinket– This is for your buddy Galdric. Galdric!

MATT: Just keeps walking, doesn't even look at you in the face, walks–

LAURA: I throw the treat and say, hey!

MATT: It scatters across the stone. Walks between your legs and exits out.

TRAVIS: I pivot on my back foot. I take out Craven Edge–

TALIESIN: No!

TRAVIS: No, I do, I take out Craven Edge and I sink it into the earth right beside his head. And I say, (shouts) heel!

MATT: Make an animal handling check.

LAURA: Whoa, is it good, is it good?

TRAVIS: 20.

MATT: As the sword (crack) into the rock outside of this fortress, it probably embeds itself a good foot and a half into the mountain. You guys all hear Grog's shout echo through the inside of the fortress itself, causing little bits of dust and small pebbles to dislodge from the roof, slowly fall down. The wolf has stopped and spun in its place and reached out and lashed the blade with its jaws and (cling) as it releases it.

TRAVIS: Stay.

MATT: He sits.

TRAVIS: That went well!

(laughter)

SAM: Dog whisperer!

TRAVIS: Good pup.

SAM: Are you its master now?

TRAVIS: No, no, I don't think it has a master. This is a very powerful beast. But it needs a firm hand. And I think it needs a job. So. What do we plan to do with Galdric? Said his name right?

SAM: Yeah.

LAURA: We plan on having him help us kill some dragons?

TALIESIN: I think he's a wolf. I think perhaps something a little less ambitious.

LAURA: Trinket hides very well when dragons are around.

TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, joining the Whitestone conclave might be a– Having him guard Whitestone, perhaps.

LAURA: Good, yeah! I like it!

TRAVIS: I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one thing of dry food rations, and a probably pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain.

LIAM: Where did we get that?

TRAVIS: Oh, there's a veritable Walmart of shit in this bag.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: And I, like a hamburger patty, smash it all together.

MATT: The only reason you even know this was at one point dark elf brain matter is because that's what you willed to reach in and find. It does not at all visually match your memory of its–

TRAVIS: Does it have a little bit of a viscous-y ooze, mostly?

MATT: Oh yeah, no, it's–

TRAVIS: It'll soften up the dry food.

LIAM: Gray Chicken McNuggets.

MATT: It'll soften up a lot of things. It's pretty terrifying.

LAURA: It'll make the wolf vomit.

TRAVIS: So I throw that on the ground, and I pour a little ale on top of it.

(laughter)

SAM: Wolves love getting drunk.

MATT: Very good. It leans forward and smells it.

TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it wasn't the best, I can do better. Okay.

LAURA: Trinket goes up and starts eating it.

TRAVIS: He's going to barf that all over the carpet later.

LIAM: Forget the chocolate.

TRAVIS: I need to carry beef in this bitch.

TALIESIN: It goes bad.

LIAM: We have Dork! We've got nothing of Dork left?

LAURA: Oh, you know what I have, by the way? I still have, like, a cooler Bag of Holding. That we got from the Slayer's Take.

TRAVIS: Oh! That's really good to know.

TRAVIS: I pour into a little chalice some ale.

LAURA: Like, it keeps things cold. Yeah, it's like a little bitty one, but it keeps parts from going bad.

MATT: It's nowhere near as large as a Bag of Holding, but it has a slow stasis for organic goods.

SAM: We should keep some food on hand next time!

LAURA: Totally!

TRAVIS: I offer him some ale, just to see if he even likes it. Some dogs like beer, some others don't.

MATT: Mm. Wolf doesn't seem to be interested.

TRAVIS: Yeah, all right. Then I chug it.

SAM: So are we telling this wolf something or commanding it to come with us as we return to town?

TALIESIN: I think he would be helpful to guard the town, at this point.

LAURA: Well, he'll follow Grog, I suppose.

SAM: Let's go back to town and bring him with us.

TRAVIS: All right.

MATT: You guys return to Whitestone. It's another, like, three-hour trek to find your way back down to the city. Stalks up next to you. Definitely seems to be attentive to your commands. Doesn't appear to be a bond per se, but of everyone that it's encountered so far, you're the only one that really gathered its respect.

LAURA: I threw a treat at it. I don't understand.

TRAVIS: That's a great thing to throw at a giant 400-pound bull mastiff.

MARISHA: I spoke words at it. Apparently that's not good enough. Communicating.

TRAVIS: Right, so we're walking back to town. We've got a giant fuck-off wolf with us. Vax looks like Edward Scissorhands.

LIAM: I'm peeling that off as we walk.

LAURA and TRAVIS: What?

TRAVIS: No!

LAURA: Leave it the fuck on!

LIAM: I'm peeling it off.

LAURA: It's really expensive. What, do you want to damage it?

LIAM: I'm peeling it off.

LAURA: (quietly) Fuck, he doesn't appreciate presents.

MATT: All right, so you take what little bit of the armor you had on, off, and are you putting your other armor back on?

LAURA: He doesn't have any other armor. I took his armor.

LIAM: I have regular fucking armor that I grew up in with you, you fucking shit.

SAM: Do you want to trade with me, Vax? I've got some armor you could take.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LIAM: You're a funny man.

MATT: All right, so you're back in town and you have a wolf.

TRAVIS: Do we find a holding pen for the wolf?

TALIESIN: I don't think we need to. I think we can communicate to him–

LAURA: No. Tell him not to attack villagers.

TALIESIN: Ask him if he'll be willing to keep the town safe.

LAURA: Do it in a really aggressive way, though, Keyleth. Stern.

MARISHA: Very aggressive? Okay. Okay.

SAM: We should find some food for the thing, too.

MARISHA: If I turned into a dog. If I turned into a wolf, do you think he'd respect me more?

LAURA: No, he'll probably attack you.

TRAVIS: He'll mount you.

LAURA: Or he'll bone you.

TALIESIN: I'm not ready for that game.

SAM: Do it.

TRAVIS: Let's be clear.

(laughter)

LAURA: Matt's like, “mm-mm.”

LIAM: Oh, you soured the DM.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: To be fair, that's happened before.

LAURA: Yeah, I remember.

TALIESIN: With the troll.

TRAVIS: With the troll. It was so good. That was you, wasn't it?

TALIESIN: No, it wasn't me. Was it you?

SAM: I don't know.

TRAVIS: Who was getting humped on?

TALIESIN: I don't remember.

SAM: Finalize this wolf so we can go kill something.

MARISHA: I take my staff and I say, Galdric! I'm being assertive.

LIAM: Yes.

SAM: She's the alpha.

LAURA: (whispering) Grog, go stand behind her.

MARISHA: You want a task? I'll give you one.

MATT: All right. How long does Speak With–

MARISHA: I don't know.

MATT: It lasts for ten minutes, so you can cast it again. It's first level.

MARISHA: Oh, has it not been ten minutes?

MATT: It has been more than ten minutes. It took you three hours to return.

MARISHA: Okay, we walked back? Okay, I'll cast it again.

MATT: All righty.

MARISHA: Can I cast Speak With Animals on other people? I can't, right? No.

MATT: All right, so as you shout, go ahead and make an animal handling check, with advantage because of your ability to speak.

MARISHA: With advantage?

MATT: Yes.

MARISHA: I'll take the– what is that, 16? Plus a six, so 22.

MATT: Okay. Galdric turns to you and essentially leans towards you and you get the essence, the idea of a message across, and to keep me from having to walk behind now, at this point, as you guys have managed to make seeming amends at the moment, employs the idea of, “I'll listen if you give me a task.”

MARISHA: He talked back.

LAURA: Have him guard the village.

MARISHA: Okay. (louder) Galdric. Only a beast of your great fortitude–

LAURA: Just fucking tell him to do it!

MARISHA: Right, okay. Sorry. Would you like to guard–

SAM: It's a command.

MARISHA: – the town, Whitestone? (shouting) Guard this town, dog.

TRAVIS: Keyleth, repeat after me.

MARISHA: Yes.

TRAVIS: In exchange for food, protect these lands.

MARISHA: Galdric. In exchange for food, shelter, and a cozy fire every once in awhile–

TRAVIS: I didn't say that shit. I didn't say that. He's a wolf. He doesn't need those.

MARISHA: Patrol these lands.

LAURA: Protect these lands.

MARISHA: Protect these lands.

TRAVIS: (quietly) Holy shit.

MATT: “For how long?”

LAURA: (laughs) He already asked that.

MARISHA: Why does he want details? Why does the dog want–

LAURA: As long as we need you to.

TRAVIS: No, no. A great danger approaches.

TALIESIN: Until the danger has passed.

TRAVIS: You'll know it when it comes.

MARISHA: (clears throat) A great danger–

LAURA: Approaches!

MARISHA: Approaches! A great danger approaches. Your service is required until that danger–

TALIESIN: Has passed.

MARISHA: Has passed! Is no longer in effect. You'll know. You'll know, because they're fucking dragons, man. You'll know. Protect–

TRAVIS: I walk over and put my hand over Keyleth's mouth. You stay. We feed you. Is there a tavern or a butcher shop or something nearby?

MATT: There is a butcher. As you're having this thought, however, Galdric turns back over to you and says, “I can feed myself.”

LAURA: Yeah, you can.

MATT: “But I will watch until this danger has passed.”

LAURA: Awesome.

MATT: “Then am I free to go?”

MARISHA: Then you are free to go.

MATT: “Very well. I grow tired of service. I wait too long.” And the wolf looks at you, gives you like an acknowledgement, and then walks off into the woods.

LAURA: Bye, buddy!

MARISHA: Thanks, Galdric. Appreciate it, man.

LAURA: Man, that's a cool-looking wolf.

MARISHA: I look at Grog. How was that? Did that sound okay?

TRAVIS: That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: You did good, you did good.

SAM: I thought she did very well.

MARISHA: Thank you. It really liked you. You should learn how to talk to animals.

LAURA: What is that? What is that you have? What is that?

TALIESIN: I'm holding onto the Raven's Slumber jewel at the moment.

SAM: The thing that can capture evil.

TALIESIN: It's empty now, and do you know what I bet would fit in it very nicely?

TRAVIS: Me.

LAURA: And we can carry him around and then pop him out. Wait, okay, wait. Is it going to hurt him? Does it hurt him? Is it like, it's bad?

SAM: Not only does it not hurt him, he does not age or feel any pain.

TRAVIS: A willing creature need not make a saving throw.

TALIESIN: It's automatic, and no time passes.

LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try it, and I'm going to try it, and just to see how he likes it. If he's okay with it.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Hey, buddy, come here.

MATT: As you turn around and look, you see there's a small puddle on the ground where Trinket has vomited up. He's pushing dirt over it.

TRAVIS: Yeah, you got to teach him to quit rummaging, that is really foul.

LAURA: What was that? Trinket, what did you eat? Don't eat the puke. Do not eat the puke. Come here.

MATT: Trinket's like scraping dirt over it.

TRAVIS: Got a carrot on your chin.

LAURA: Trinket. Do you want to go for a ride? You like rides? Yeah? You want to go for one? All right, sit still. This'll be fun. I don't know how to use it.

TALIESIN: Just point, yep.

LAURA: I point to him with the–

SAM: You should probably say something cool.

LAURA: By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you my Pokemon.

(laughter)

MATT: Words be damned. It takes you an action or so to activate the crystal, but as you do, Trinket gives a confused look before Trinket's shadow seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into this circle, this dark core, roughly half the size of Trinket's form, before it shoots into the crystal.

LAURA: Is he about this size, but I don't like that one, is he about this size?

MATT: A little larger than that before he goes into the crystal, but once he's in the crystal, it's small.

LAURA: Oh, it's a little crystal?

LIAM: Trinkachu, I choose you.

LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh. That's really fun. Okay. How do I let him go?

MARISHA: I think you– yeah.

LAURA: I release you.

MATT: Okay. As you do that, once again the same dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits the ground in front of you, and from that dark shadow area Trinket's form emerges, standing there looking really confused.

LAURA: How was it? Did it hurt? Can you talk to him? You can still talk to him. Talk to him. Ask him if it hurt.

MATT: (vomiting noises) Vomits a little bit more on the ground.

LAURA: Well, that's not good.

MARISHA: You know, sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch.

LAURA: Ask him how he's doing.

MARISHA: Trinket? You all right buddy? You all right, there?

MATT: “Feeling sick.”

LAURA: Ask him how the little car ride was, ask him if he liked the ride.

MARISHA: How was the ride? Did you feel all right? How was–?

MATT: “Yeah?”

LAURA: Okay, would you mind, ask him if he'd mind doing that on occasion, you know, whenever I need him to.

MARISHA: What was it like in there? Was it–?

MATT: “I don't remember.”

MARISHA: Okay, that's good, that's good. Would you mind–

LAURA: Ask him if he cares if I do it again, ask him if he cares.

MARISHA: Would you mind doing that, you know, frequently? On occasion.

MATT: “If she wants me to, okay.”

LAURA: What did he say, what did he say? He looked really cute when he said something.

MARISHA: You have a lot of men who will do anything for you.

LAURA: Oh, buddy! I go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears.

MATT: You do, and avoid the little bit of–

LAURA: –vomit on, I don't even care! Oh my gosh, thank you! This is the best, this is the best and we can travel with him, we can climb with him, we can sneak around.

SAM: Hey, and if Trinket isn't in it, you can also use it to capture baddies.

LAURA: I know, it's great!

TALIESIN: And because of the way that the projection works, you could also in theory capture a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and watch them drop.

LAURA: Oh my god.

MARISHA: Oh my god, you're right.

TALIESIN: It's very convenient.

LAURA: Oh my gosh. Okay.

MATT: So. You have a crystal, you've set a wolf on a path.

SAM: Where are we going next?

MATT: Where are you going now?

TALIESIN: Your home, I imagine.

LAURA: Don't we need to–oh, yeah.

SAM: What's our to-do list?

MARISHA: We don't have to worry about it. We can, it's fine.

TALIESIN: Fire Ashari it is.

SAM: Wait, wait, wait. What are the things that we need to do?

LAURA: We need to check in on Keyleth's family.

SAM: Cobalt Reserve, Ashari.

LAURA: Grog's family.

SAM: Did we already take care of Osysa's mate, Frostweald?

LAURA: No, but that's down–

TALIESIN: That's far.

MARISHA: That's the other Vestige, correct?

LAURA: Yes, that's over by Grog's family.

MATT: That's information about the Vestiges.

SAM: We need to steal an airship.

TALIESIN: I agree, that's still very important.

TRAVIS: I can't remember where, what–

LAURA: They were by Kraghammer.

TRAVIS: Thank you. I'm having terrible hiccups.

SAM: What about, we need to find Kaylie at some point. We also need to, who's gone, where's Allu– where's Ki– where's people?

LAURA: Allura should be here in like a day. She should be here very soon.

TRAVIS: What's close to here? (hiccups)

TALIESIN: Nothing's close, we're specifically far away from everything.

MARISHA: But we can go wherever we want as long as we've been there before.

TRAVIS: Well, we should definitely go to the Fire Ashari.

TALIESIN: Fire Ashari is the next–

LAURA: We should go to the Fire Ashari.

MARISHA: Oh god, I'm immediately nauseous.

MATT: (bear noises)

LIAM: That's two of us.

MARISHA: Oh, Trinket, buddy. What time is it?

LAURA: (laughs) Do you need some water?

MATT: It's still, with the travel to and from, it's middle afternoon, like one o'clock in the afternoon.

TALIESIN: Take it.

SAM: If we're going to go, do we need anything before we leave? We got everything we need? Potions and stuff? Want to buy some meat for your cooler?

LAURA: Yeah, let's get some meat.

MATT: It's pretty easy to go ahead and procure it, five gold of meat will fill that thing.

LAURA: Yeah!

MATT: So go ahead and mark five gold off your paper.

SAM: How much, could I buy a medical kit somewhere?

MATT: Yeah, you could find a general store and purchase a medical kit.

SAM: How much is that?

MATT: I'm going to look that up right now.

SAM: All right, whatever, I've got it.

TALIESIN: It's nifty that you have a book that tells you how much something like that costs.

MATT: Imagine that. It's like it's a handbook of some kind, it's crazy.

MARISHA: Does anyone have any fire-resistant items?

LAURA: He does.

LIAM: I do.

LAURA: Put it on.

MARISHA: I might pick up some fire resistant potions as well.

TRAVIS: I have this black iron plate that I haven't used ever. 'While wearing this heavy plate armor, the bearer gains resistance to any fire damage.'

MATT: Five gold for an herbalist's kit for you.

LAURA: Oh, plate armor, none of us can wear it but Pike.

MATT: An herbalist's kit, like five gold.

SAM: Can that stabilize people?

MATT: If used with a medicine check, yeah.

LAURA: Okay, I have this, which I can't wear.

TALIESIN: What is that?

LAURA: It's a purple and black robe. It was Lady Briarwood's robes.

TALIESIN: What does it do?

LAURA: Clings to nearby darkness as you walk. While wearing this robe, you gain resistance to piercing damage. Anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes?

TALIESIN: I'm pretty reasonable.

SAM: Do I wear robes?

MATT: Robes would be worn instead of your armor.

SAM: No thanks.

LAURA: What about Gloves of Missile Snaring? That appeal to anyone?

SAM: Missile snaring? What does that do?

LAURA: These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them, and when a ranged weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity modifier provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the missile if it's small enough to hold in that hand.

TALIESIN: Does it require attuning?

MARISHA: They're pretty sleek.

LAURA: It requires two, no it just requires one free hand.

TALIESIN: Yes, but does it require attuning?

LAURA: Yes it does, it requires attuning.

TALIESIN: I might be attuned out at this point.

LAURA: Anybody? I feel like that could be cool for you, Scanlan.

SAM: I think I can take it?

TALIESIN: What's your dex? Your dexterity is not very– actually, it might work out well for me, weirdly enough.

MARISHA: Are you fully attuned?

TALIESIN: I can undo something that I'm not using.

MARISHA: Percy, you have access here in Whitestone to alchemy supplies, correct?

TALIESIN: Matt, I have access to alchemy supplies here in Whitestone, correct?

MATT: (laughs) I mean, there are elements of your initial workshop I guess, that a lot of supplies have been cannibalized but a few things can be pieced together. Plus there was a lot of alchemical elements and tools that were utilized in the subterranean tunnels as part of the refinement process for the whitestone residuum, the large vats of acid that were distilled by the Briarwoods while they were here, and there are other elements of their own tinkering in the alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout the castle. So yeah, you can definitely find enough to tinker with if you want.

MARISHA: I mean, we could take the rest of the evening and I can attempt to make some fire resist potions.

SAM: Eh.

TRAVIS: All right, here's what I'm thinking, right? I mean, if we go after my herd, we're in for a fight. A big one. If we go to your Fire Ashari, we're doing recon and hopefully learning something, right?

MARISHA: Well, we're going to be in for a fight at the Fire Ashari as well because there's a giant sunder in the fire plane, and last time I checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring through there.

TRAVIS: Are those bad?

TALIESIN: Eh.

MARISHA: They're annoying

TALIESIN: As long as we're quick we can go about it.

MARISHA: Well.

SAM: What's our mission?

TRAVIS: You really want to get the rest of the testicles of–

MARISHA: I mean, we could theoretically see if there are survivors and I can attempt to close the tear in the plane. I don't know if I can do that. However, I don't know anyone else particularly more qualified to attempt it.

TRAVIS: Allura or that bearded dude.

MARISHA: We're talking about the Fire Ashari and possibly what to do there.

LAURA: Oh.

MARISHA: We can go and look for survivors–

LAURA: And bring them here.

MARISHA: And someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane.

LAURA: Should we wait for Allura then, before we go?

TRAVIS: Well, if there are survivors, they might not be that way for very long if we don't go.

LAURA: They've been there for a while already.

MARISHA: If there are survivors–

LAURA: Then they're surviving.

MARISHA: They've survived. I agree. It's not going to be pretty.

TALIESIN: I know you don't want to go.

MARISHA: I really don't.

TALIESIN: But we need to go. I say we take the rest of the day. You make your potions, we leave first thing in the morning.

LAURA: Wait for Allura, hopefully she'll be here by then.

TALIESIN: Maybe Allura will join us by tomorrow morning. If not, we teleport over.

MATT: Okay, you guys are going to rest for the evening?

TRAVIS: Wait, hold on, is there like a house of entertainment in Whitestone? I know it's just getting back on its feet but you know.

MATT: That would be a question more for Percival.

TRAVIS: Percy? I'm having a bit of a soul struggle and I'm wondering if I might bend your ear for a moment.

TALIESIN: Sure.

TRAVIS: Yeah, could I speak to you over here?

TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

TRAVIS: Right, so, like, I want to get my freak on.

TALIESIN: I don't feel that way about you.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I, I'm sorry.

TALIESIN: I mean, you're very attractive.

TRAVIS: That was very unclear. So I know this is like your home and stuff and you might not have been aware of it, but they have these houses where like….

TALIESIN: Oh, where you get your freak on!

TRAVIS: Yes.

TALIESIN: Yes. Yes, we have them.

TRAVIS: Oh good, do you think they're still in order?

TALIESIN: Oh, I imagine so.

TRAVIS: Could you point me in that direction?

TALIESIN: No, I have no idea where they are. I do know that they exist. I actually had things to do here. I didn't have time for these.

TRAVIS: Oh yeah, me too, important things. I was thinking for Scanlan in case he gets bored, you know, you've got to keep him focused.

TALIESIN: I wouldn't actually know where any of these places were, would I?

MATT: No, and those that did exist in this town have not been…

TALIESIN: I figured as much. I'm just fucking with him. Okay. No.

TRAVIS: Oh, okay, well, I'll let Scanlan know. Just keep it between you and me 'cause he's very sensitive about these things.

TALIESIN: Your secret is safe with my indifference. That's fine.

TRAVIS: Well, my, my, indifference

TALIESIN: I know you do.

TRAVIS: Yep.

TALIESIN: You're wonderful.

MARISHA: Can I start telling that to people in real life?

TALIESIN: Yes you can. I do it all the time.

MARISHA: Yes. Your secret is safe with my indifference.

TRAVIS: Okay. I'm going to rest.

SAM: Before we set off on this, is there anything closer or more pressing? I don't actually know why we're going to her place, but I'm fine with it.

MARISHA: To look for survivors and close the giant tear in the fire plane that evil, well not evil, fiery entities are pouring through.

TALIESIN: It's a hellmouth, it's basically a hellmouth.

TRAVIS: It's either that or we go goliath hunting.

LAURA: That's next.

TALIESIN: But this is quick, this is something that we can knock off the list.

SAM: All right, let's knock it off.

TRAVIS: Yeah, right, let's just check it off.

LIAM: As we're walking through town, do I see any weaponsmiths?

MATT: Make an investigation check.

LIAM: Okay.

TALIESIN: I'll help you make the potions.

LIAM: 21.

MATT: Okay, that'll help cut down on the time. 21? There are two functional smiths left in the town. There were two more than that overall, that were more like blacksmithy, but they both unfortunately lost their lives in the insurrection. But there are two functional blacksmiths in this, yeah.

LIAM: And one's nearby, to pass through?

MATT: About a ten-minute diversion.

LIAM: I'm splitting off from the group.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: We've got to get out of here.

LIAM: One's in front of me now?

MATT: Well, you find your way to– it's a small blacksmith, and most of it's outside. Though the day is growing late, you do see an older gentleman, long, tattered grey hair pulled into a very tight bun in the back and a beard that is actually tied off to the side. Otherwise it would be hanging down into his work. He's wearing soot-covered clothes, big leather apron, leather gloves, and he's currently in the process of (ping ping) turning over and hammering out a piece of orange glowing steel.

LIAM: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt, I have a very simple request.

MATT: He doesn't stop. He seems to, he acknowledges your presence but he's still working as he's listening. (smithing sounds)

LIAM: I have six gold burning a hole in my pocket. I'm not looking for anything simple. Do you have a short sword? A regular old shortsword.

MATT: (ting) He looks over at you. “If that's what you're looking for, on that wall over there we've got two shortswords.” (ting)

LIAM: What's the difference between the two that I can see?

MATT: (smithing sounds) That you can see? Make a perception check.

LIAM: 22.

MATT: Looking over them both, from this distance, they're both made with different hilt designs and different pommel designs, the grips are a little different but other than that the blades are pretty much identical.

LIAM: I grab one off the wall. I slap down six gold, which I know is way too much and say, thank you sir. Pelor lives here. And I walk away.

MATT: Okay, as you start walking away he goes, “Hey.”

LIAM: Yeah?

MATT: “You're going to pay proper for that shortsword.”

LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry. How much does it cost?

MATT: “12 gold pieces.”

LIAM: My apologies. 12?

MATT: “12 gold pieces, friend.”

LIAM: So I put down six. I put down another 14. I really apologize. I was just confused.

MATT: “It's all right. No harm no foul.” Takes the gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch. “Have a good day.”

LIAM: I walk down the street going like– it's big.

MATT: It's much bigger than you're used to, but it's got a fine balance to it and it's well-made. All right, so as you guys have all–

LAURA: I've got an opal dagger you could have used.

LIAM: I don't need your dagger.

TALIESIN: We're going to make our potions?

MATT: Yes, yes. All right, so.

MARISHA: I have another question.

MATT: What is your other question?

MARISHA: Before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under Whitestone?

TALIESIN: There's really not a lot of it.

MARISHA: Say like $1,000 worth and maybe have like a real nice Heroes' Feast before tomorrow?

LIAM: Wise as fuck.

LAURA: Or in the morning.

LIAM: Heroes' Breakfast.

MARISHA: I've got to do it at night, because I have to Tree Stride in the morning.

MATT: You can choose either to create the potion or to mine the residuum for the evening. You cannot do both. Both are time, like, to pull that material from the– because most of it that remains has been already embedded within the ziggurat beneath. You would actually have to physically chip it from the structure.

LAURA: I have a plan, Keyleth.

MARISHA: Yes?

LAURA: We will cover the 1,000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit for us and give it to us later.

MARISHA: I like that plan, yeah. Sounds good to me.

SAM: How about the wolf?

TALIESIN: So potions.

LAURA: Percival, do you have people here who can mine? Looking for work, people–?

MARISHA: Yeah, sure, why not?

TALIESIN: I'll let them know that they should start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall, but it's dangerous down there.

LAURA: Yeah, it is.

TALIESIN: And tampering with it is definitely…

TRAVIS: Necessary.

TALIESIN: Should be ginger. It would, I'm trying to keep everything ginger down there.

LAURA: So maybe we should take 1,000 gold just from your family stores then, huh? That might be smarter.

TALIESIN: We currently have 1,000 gold from my family stores that are in the group treasury at the moment.

LAURA: Oh, we do. No, that's 500. That was just 500. Just so you know.

TALIESIN: I feel like it was more than that.

LAURA: No, it was just 500.

LIAM: Hey, de Rolo, do you remember what happened yesterday?

TALIESIN: He's not there.

LAURA: Isn't he, though?

TALIESIN: I was going to do such a nice thing for you, but never mind now.

LAURA: (laughs) No, no, no, do something really nice for me.

LIAM: Where did I go? Oh, I went to buy a shortsword.

TALIESIN: No, never mind. You went to buy a shortsword.

LAURA: Dear, dear, dear, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Do nice things. All right?

TALIESIN: I'm trying to be gentle with my family right now. They're taking on an awful lot.

LAURA: You're right. They're taking on so many people.

TALIESIN: And we'll see what we can do.

LIAM: I'd like to think you hear me in your mind.

TALIESIN: Always fucking hear you in my mind.

LAURA: Let's just use the damned party funds for the time being. It's fine, Keyleth. This is a really important feast.

TALIESIN: We're busy making potions.

LAURA: All right.

MATT: So you prepare a Heroes' Feast before you begin this potion-creation process? Is that what I understand or not?

LAURA: What?

MARISHA: Can I make some potions and then, like, I make dinner for us before we go to bed?

MATT: It's going to take you about the length of a day to create the potion, with his help it takes it to about half, so it'll be about 12 hours of creating. Eight to 12 hours. So.

TRAVIS: Pick one.

TALIESIN: Pick one.

MARISHA: I'll do a damn feast.

TALIESIN: No potion?

MATT: You can do the potion as well. The feast only takes a moment to cast.

MARISHA: All right, okay. Yeah.

MATT: I'm just saying, be aware that you guys will probably have, if you want to get a full rest after that potion creation process, you're going to have to wait until like this time tomorrow, like late in the day to make your journey. Which is fine, if you're willing to be patient about it.

TRAVIS: Sure.

MATT: Yes, no?

TRAVIS: Say one, just say one.

MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it, let's do it. Let's go in prepared and then we can always rest on that side.

MATT: Cool. For a fine, fine dinner.

LAURA: Just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that it's most useful.

MATT: All right, so. You, everyone else goes to sleep while you and Percy work tirelessly through the night. If I could have you–

LIAM: Fuck!

MATT: (laughs) Just for the sake of it, I want you to go ahead and make an arcana check.

MARISHA: Aw, an arcana? Do I get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy? I'm skilled in alchemy.

MATT: Yeah. Oh, that's right you are, never mind, go ahead and do that.

MATT: Proficiency bonus, are you proficient in alchemy?

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: So proficiency bonus, and for this, use intellect modifier.

MARISHA: Okay. Intellect, which makes it plus seven. Do I have advan– ooh, I rolled a natural 19.

MATT: Okay. We'll say, for the fair cost of, reduced due to the roll, 450 gold pieces, you create a potion of resistance of your choice of resistance.

MARISHA: Just one?

MATT: Just one.

MARISHA: Fire.

MATT: It takes a long time, man.

MARISHA: Fire!

MATT: Fire, all right. You create a potion of fire resistance. The materials cost you 450 gold to create, you finish it by about sunrise the next day. Everyone else begins slowly waking up after the night's rest as you guys both, bags under your eyes.

LAURA: Oh, that was a good night's sleep, I tell you what.

TRAVIS: Seriously.

SAM: Keyleth, could you–

MARISHA: What? Oh, god, you snuck up on me.

SAM: Could you make me some tea real quick?

MARISHA: Scanlan.

SAM: What?

MARISHA: Go fuck yourself.

SAM: What, you were up before me, I thought–

TALIESIN: All right. All right, this is fine.

MARISHA: This is fine.

TALIESIN: This is good.

MARISHA: This is great.

MATT: You're doing a Heroes' Feast for breakfast, then? Is that how it's working?

MARISHA: I'll take a nap. I'll cook breakfast, guys, good morning. Good morning!

LAURA: Oh hey, good morning, Keyleth!

SAM: Why don't you sleep during the day, we'll all take our feast, and then blast off at night time?

MARISHA: Because I have to teleport and cooking this feast are both 6th-level spells and I can only do one of those a day.

TRAVIS: Man, it's hard being a druid.

LAURA: Can anybody else make a feast? That's here?

MARISHA: Pike. Pike. Pike?

SAM: She's with Gilmore.

TRAVIS: She's not here.

LAURA: (sighs) I miss Pike.

LIAM: We all miss Pike.

MARISHA: I'll cook breakfast, guys.

LAURA: No, I'll cook breakfast. No, I won't cook breakfast.

LIAM: That's a good idea, for you to not cook breakfast.

MATT: What's the plan?

MARISHA: I'm cooking breakfast!

MATT: Are you cooking breakfast or are you summoning breakfast? That's my question.

LAURA: Are you summoning breakfast and then you're sleeping and then we're leaving?

MARISHA: I'm summoning– yes, I'm summoning breakfast and then I'm sleeping.

LAURA: And then you're sleeping and then we're leaving as soon as you wake up.

MATT: Okay, that's what I was wondering. We got the answer, okay, cool. Hoo, today's been a slog. All right, so you go ahead and you use Heroes' Feast, summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal filled with coffee and eggs and everything you would hope for, the finest materials.

LAURA: Froot Loops!

MATT: (laughs) Sure, Froot Loops is on the menu, why not?

TALIESIN: Lucky Charms.

MATT: No Lucky Charms, sorry, those aren't available on Tal'Dorei. But yes, all you guys take an hour to finish devouring this, you finish your meal, all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum increase to your hit points.

LAURA: Ooh, ooh, greens, greens!

MATT: And immune to poison, frightened, and all wisdom saving throws have advantage.

TRAVIS: Damn!

SAM: Advantage on wisdom.

MATT: Yes, the usual.

TRAVIS: Almost broke.

MARISHA: And wisdom.

LAURA: And you're immune to fear, right?

MARISHA: Immune to fear, poison, and what else?

MATT: And you get advantage on wisdom saving throws.

SAM: Okay.

MATT: After which, Percy and Keyleth pretty much fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they both collapse to the ground, eggs out of the corner of their mouth. Eventually they make themselves back up to sleep and the rest of you guys peter around for the remainder of the day while they get their full rest. It now comes to, at the end of that eight-hour period of time, I'd say about three, four in the afternoon before they finally wake up. You've restored your spells.

MARISHA: Yay!

MATT: And the rest of you are ready to go about your business.

LAURA: Let's go, let's go, let's go.

LIAM: Wait! While they're sleeping, right–

MATT: Mm-hmm?

LIAM: I take Scanlan aside.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Oi.

LIAM: Hey, buddy.

SAM: Hey, friendo.

LIAM: Yeah.

SAM: What's up?

LIAM: We don't talk a lot.

SAM: Well, we start to and then you leave the room, usually.

(laughter)

LIAM: I don't handle personal emotional confrontation very well.

SAM: It's okay. I walk away.

(laughter)

MARISHA: Oh, shit!

SAM: Then I come back, I feel bad.

TALIESIN: No, no, that was perfect.

LIAM: Where did you go?

SAM: Just kidding, just kidding.

LIAM: Pull up a chair, sit down, I want to ask you something.

SAM: I'm already as low as I can go.

LIAM: You're right. How do you do it?

SAM: How do I do what?

LIAM: How do you do it? You're risking your life as much as anyone in this group, you're almost dying every day. You're fucking smiling all the time. How do you do it? I'm kind of asking as Liam to Sam as well, but mostly as Vax to Scanlan. How do you do it? You almost died yesterday as well. Or two days ago, fuck. Why do you do it?

SAM: Well, Vax. I don't know, I mean, I like you people, okay? Everything before this was not as good. This is better. That's why. It's very simple. You had a shitty childhood, didn't you? You and the sister?

LIAM: Yeah.

SAM: I think Grog had some troubles. We've all had our share of shit before we all met. Now we're together, we're a family, this is better. That's how I smile. It's better than it was before. That's it.

LIAM: We're probably going to die in the next month.

SAM: Yes, but it's fun while it lasts.

LIAM: All right. Thought I might–

SAM: Glean some wisdom?

LIAM: Yeah, but I'm just as confused as before.

SAM: Listen, I'm older than you.

LIAM: How much older?

SAM: A bit. I've seen more than you have. And it's all shitty, so it just depends on how you look at it. You can dwell on the shit, or you can just leave it behind in people's beds and keep going.

MARISHA: Oh god, that works on too many levels.

TALIESIN: Oh god, that's too deep.

MARISHA: Too deep.

LIAM: You did that. Water under the bridge.

SAM: I walk away.

LIAM: That little motherfucker shit in my bed.

MATT: All right. As you regather your will, path chosen; Keyleth, do you wish to prepare the transportation spell?

MARISHA: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Let's do this.

MATT: All right. All of you gather and find your way down to the Sun Tree in the center of the town. At this point, it's later afternoon, you've been growing accustomed these past few days of taking action right around dusk, and as the sky turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue, you all find yourselves ready to transition back over to the continent of Issylra.

MARISHA: Let's go. To the Sun Tree.

MATT: Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation, and you watch the trunk once again tear open into the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On the opposite side, what's your destination?

MARISHA: Oh, god. As close as I can get to the Fire Ashari, I guess.

MATT: Okay. You recall, passing through, there were a number of trees towards the base of the mountain that were starting to grow petrified from the proximity to the ash that constantly falls from the sky. They died a long time ago and are slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that the dark rock that formulates that mountain range. At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow, and you all begin to step through in rapid succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of you find yourself stepping out the other side, at which point you look up and you can see the pathway that you took towards the top of the mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do notice immediately is that the path that you took initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against the now very dark sky, this side of the realm itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this point, you've actually beaten the sun.

MARISHA: Oh, do we gain a few hours?

MATT: Yeah, you guys have gained a few hours, technically.

MARISHA: Awesome.

MATT: So it's still light in the sky from other parts in the distance, however, there is a perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you recall the first time you were here, that's the nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick, heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling molten rock that has filled that entire walkway, and it has come to rest at the base of the mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool. You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point as you step out of the tree. However, where you see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain, you– it's cooled and formed into solid rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark, then another section turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few moments pass and you can see the orange of the next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's going dark and hardening on its own. You get the sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since before you arrived.

MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to figure out what's up?

MATT: Sure. Actually, this would be a perception check to see if you can ascertain.

MARISHA: 16.

MATT: 16. It's difficult to make out at this distance, but you can see, along portions of the jagged mountainside, a collection of small figures that are making their way up the mountain, and their slow ascent is met with the lava flow cooling in sections.

MARISHA: Do they look like people, like humanoids?

MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance, they look human-ish, humanoid-ish.

TALIESIN: I attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them.

MATT: Sure, go ahead and make a perception check.

TALIESIN: 18.

MATT: 18. A little bit of a clearer look through, they do appear to be humanoid. You do see two arms, two legs. You can't gauge size comparison from this distance.

SAM: How far?

MATT: At this point, they're probably a good 800 feet up the mountain.

MARISHA: 800 feet?

TALIESIN: Are they dressed like the Ashari that I've met?

MATT: From what you can make out, their color palette shifts, there are reds and browns, some stand out as an aquamarine white. The Ashari you saw were a pretty consistent color palette. This is a little more varied.

TALIESIN: I don't know who these people are.

MARISHA: They could still be Ashari. Just in their elemental forms. Are there any birds around? I look up, do I see birds in the sky?

MATT: There are no birds in the sky. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this area, especially as the oppressive fumes and dust continue to pour off from the top of the caldera of this mountain range, it has made it not fitting for any sort of aerial life that you're used to seeing. You glance around for about a minute or two and you don't see any sort of bird life in the air.

TRAVIS: Did the ground cool where they were walking? Could we follow them up?

TALIESIN: We should.

MARISHA: Let's stay far behind. Let's go quietly.

LAURA: Let's walk. Stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

MATT: Okay. Everyone make a stealth check, including Trinket.

TRAVIS: You don't want to put him in the thing?

SAM: You could.

LAURA: (gasps) Okay.

LIAM: Try it out.

LAURA: I put it on a string so I could put it around my neck because it's a necklace because it's cooler that way.

MATT: Well, it has a chain on it that it came with.

LAURA: It's got a chain on it, so it's around my neck.

MATT: All right, so you take it, you put–

SAM: It has a chain and a string now.

MATT: Chain and string.

MARISHA: The string's so you don't forget.

MATT: Exactly. You trigger the necklace, pointing it in the direction of Trinket, and once again Trinket is absorbed into the crystal, vanishing within the inside. All right.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: 17.

SAM: Pass Without a Trace is–?

TRAVIS: Plus ten. I rolled shitty.

LAURA: 30.

LIAM: 35.

MARISHA: 32.

TALIESIN: 29.

SAM: 25.

MATT: Okay. You guys begin making your trek up. How are you going up the mountain? Are you scaling the cooled flow?

MARISHA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: That's probably the safest route given the fact that most of the other side of the mountain range itself is pretty jagged, and elements of it, because of the formation of this giant volcanic caldera, there are portions of broken stone and obsidian glass that sticks out the side.

MARISHA: As we're walking up, I fall behind and I slip Vax the potion of fire protection.

MATT: All right. You guys continue in pace with this, eventually, and make another perception check?

MARISHA: Much better, that's a natural 19. 30.

MATT: 30. Okay. Looking up, as this cluster of individuals makes their way towards the very top of the mountain, seemingly not taking sight of your traveling group, you're beginning to see the nature of each section of this flow cooling. And what you're seeing is the group will move up a bit, stop, and there appears to be a burst of– sometimes it looks like very strong wind, sometimes it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is brought against the side of the mountain and is actually forcefully cooling the flow down temporarily, at least in those sections, before it begins to spill over and continue its slow molten descent, but they're doing their best to continue to force it back up the mountain and–

LAURA and MARISHA: Those are druids.

MARISHA: I cast Skywrite in the clouds above us, in the smoke.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: And I write–

LAURA: “So, how are you guys doing up there?”

TALIESIN: “Hi.”

MARISHA: “Hi. Hey you guys.” I write, in druidic symbols, “Keyleth, Kaitiakè.”

SAM: What's that? Is that her?

MATT: Okay. You notice the pace in which this group has ascended comes to a halt at the very, very top of the mountain range where it ends, and there's a slight pause before the clouds shift a second time and it says, from what you understand, “Kaitiakè. Survivors remain, Keyleth.”

MARISHA: And I respond with, “Help has arrived.”

SAM: You guys are texting?

MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

MATT: Druid texting.

LAURA: What are you saying?

TALIESIN: Stop looking at your phone.

LAURA: What do they say?

SAM: Why don't we go over there and talk to them?

MARISHA: They're survivors.

TRAVIS: Well, let's go.

LAURA: Are they nice?

MARISHA: They're survivors. What does it matter?

TRAVIS: And we go.

MARISHA: Let's go. And I tell them, you know, “Arriving. Stand down. Here we come.”

TALIESIN: “Lol.”

MARISHA: “Lol. Winky-face.”

LIAM: As we travel, because I was too out of it to respond and she's way ahead, I take the potion that Keyleth gave to me, because she didn't have to, I've got the David Bowie armor on now.

MATT: You did don it. Okay.

LIAM: Yes, yeah. Before going to bed.

MARISHA: Oh you did, okay.

LIAM: And I press it into Vex's hand.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: Hey, I took your, all right, I'm going to take it.

MATT: What was your choice of resistance? I assume it was fire. Okay. All right. As you guys progress up, and it is, though it is a safe route, it is still a relatively steep incline and you're all having to work together to find handholds, and it is very arduous physically getting up there. I would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

SAM: Oh, shit.

LAURA: A constitution?

MATT: Yes.

LAURA: Oh, do we get advantage because of the feast?

TRAVIS: No, that's only wisdom.

LAURA: Shit.

LIAM: Come on, Colville meteorite die.

TRAVIS: 17.

LIAM: I'm so weak.

LAURA: Come on, jade.

LIAM: Natural 20!

LAURA: You motherfucker!

LIAM: Thank you, Matthew Colville.

LAURA: I'm rolling my giant jade dice, because it's green.

TRAVIS: Way to announce it.

LAURA: Womp-womp. Oh, that's a six.

TRAVIS: (laughs) You're fucked.

MARISHA: 20.

TALIESIN: 13.

SAM: Five.

MATT: Okay. As you guys begin to get partially up the mountain, the proximity of the heat from the– because the exterior of the rock has cooled, but it's still molten beneath and there are parts of that are still cracking open, and bits of the heat are still pouring through, plus the general physical exertion from the not-very-hardy physiques of both Vex and Scanlan, you both suffer one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the side of this mountain.

LAURA: Oh, Trinket's in his thing, he's not worried at all.

TALIESIN: I don't actually know what one level of exhaustion is.

MATT: You guys have disadvantage on ability checks. All your skill checks right now, until your next long rest, are at disadvantage.

TRAVIS: Levels of exhaustion suck.

SAM: Not saving.

MATT: However, as you guys are approaching towards the top, you can see now the humanoids that were at the top of this mountain crest have been since keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to crest over again and continue its flow, it's blasted again from the side and cools and it's building this very, very slow gradual outcropping–

MARISHA: I use my cantrip Gust and cool areas alongside as we ascend.

MATT: Okay. You glance up and you now have a better view of this group, and what you do see ahead of you, specifically Keyleth, appears to be a cluster of about eight or so Fire Ashari-dressed individuals. You can't make out their physical details yet. Along with five other entities that are dressed in the colors and vestments of those from Zephrah.

MARISHA: Oh shit!

TRAVIS: From who? From what?

LIAM: What's the matter?

LAURA: What's up? What's happening?

MARISHA: I run up.

MATT: Keyleth goes running up.

MARISHA: You said seven or eight from Zephrah?

MATT: There are five from Zephrah.

LAURA: Are we going to, we're going to follow?

LIAM: Yeah, I'm breaking out of stealth and running.

TALIESIN: Ah. Yeah. No. We're running now.

LAURA: I walk. I'm pretty tired. You and me. Let's just walk.

SAM: Yeah. You can carry me.

TALIESIN: Cardio. God.

MATT: Okay, it takes a while to get up there. As you guys begin to approach, a little bit behind Keyleth, and you look, you see the only two notable Fire Ashari that you see there are Nastoen, which is a human female that you saw was one of the four that first greeted you as you approached Pyrah when you got to the mountaintop. She looks a little rough, but she's definitely in one piece. The other one that greets you, and immediately you recognize as Flamespeaker Cerkonos, who currently does not have his right arm. It is charred and is, through some semblance of flame, cauterized to where he no longer has a shoulder and part of his torso is a black mass of burnt skin, probably intentionally, but as you approach he puts his hand out and goes, “Hail, Keyleth.”

MARISHA: Hail, Cerkonos. And I run up and give him a hug.

MATT: He pats you on the back and there's a coldness to his look, his expression. You can see in a brief instant, though there is strength and determination, there is a moment as he looks into your face that you can see the sorrow of losing most of his people.

MARISHA: And I look back at him and I say: I'm so sorry.

MATT: “This is not your fault. We had this coming. We are the able-bodied few you see.”

MARISHA: Are these all that have survived?

MATT: “We are 25 living. The rest reside at the base of the mountain, to be watched, or are the watchers. But our attrition is of our own making. We helped outsiders too long ago.”

MARISHA: What? What do you mean, like, how long ago? 12, 15 years?

MATT: “We helped seal a drake in this rift.”

LAURA: Thordak.

MATT: “That is the name they call him. We helped bring and bind the beast to this rift, sealing within it the heart of a primordial flame, one of the few pure essence crystals of our plane. Such a binding will not allow it to leave. It is a punishment for the most terrible of evils that the Ashari take under their order. We carved from the crystal in bind. This beast was too strong and took the entire crystal, but it seemed enough. It seemed enough.”

MARISHA: Cerkonos, it's not your fault. There are greater forces at work here, beyond us. That's something that I am desperately trying to reassure myself of every day.

MATT: And a voice comes up from over the mountain range, raspy, older, and with a casual importance to it, and it says, “So, are you claiming some semblance of dealing with this?” And as it steps over, the face looks down with recognition. “My god. Keyleth.”

MARISHA: Who are you?

MATT: You guys look up and you see long, silver-haired half-elf in later years dressed in the blue and white robes of the Air Ashari. You see before you Korren, your father. “You live.”

MARISHA: Dad!

MATT: He steps forward and goes in, as he steps away from Cerkonos, takes you in his arms and holds you extremely tight against him.

MARISHA: I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. I didn't want you to be disappointed.

MATT: “Shh.” He puts his finger up to your lips, holds you back and looks you over and with a smile on his face, you can see the hardness of his expression fade. “Keyleth, you've grown.”

MARISHA: A lot's happened.

MATT: “You look just like her.”

MARISHA: I haven't found Mom.

MATT: “Her path was her own. I'm just glad that you have maintained yours.” He wipes the tear from your face and says, “How goes the Aramente?”

MARISHA: Well.

LAURA: She's kicking ass.

MATT: “Good. Good.” And he places his thumb at the corner of his eye. “We were called naught but a day ago by the surviving Pyrah. Told of the angry mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the rift. I helmed the team while the majority of our people stayed to keep Zephrah cloaked and safe from the marauding beast. We've only just made our way up the mountain. Your arrival is quite fortuitous, as we need all the help we can get.”

SAM: How can we be of assistance?

MATT: “Come. See what remains of Pyrah.” He turns around and walks back over towards the top of the mountain.

MARISHA: Daddy.

MATT: He stops. Looks over his shoulder towards you. “Yes?”

MARISHA: It's good to see you again, father.

MATT: “It's good to see you as well, daughter. Now come. Show me what you've learned.” Goes back to walking. The rest of the Fire Ashari stand up, acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand here before, visiting once before. Cerkonos looks about. “You show strength and honor by coming here in our time of need. This will not be forgotten. Now come.” As you follow them up over the top of the mountain, you see once again before you the caldera of this once-volcanic mountain has been blown apart in areas. You can see sections of large black stone that are now pushed up into jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth blackened shale countryside. You can see there are pits of molten rock that have been punched through the floor and have gathered into these pools where the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the heat that is now released above the mountaintop. The flow of lava that descends down the side of this mountain continues and swells and heads inward towards the Cindergrove. The Cindergrove, from what you can see from this distance, is but a fraction of what was once there, most of the trees now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of this mountain. You can see bits and pieces of the various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet from the center. There are still standing, defiant trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but they are very sparse, many of them now blackened by what you can see in the very distance beyond the broken huts and homes that once held the Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing dots of various elemental energies spiraling outward from a very large central red rift that sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last returned here. What was once the portal in the ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly piercing out of the top of this mountain. Undaunted, your father and the other Ashari continue walking forward with no words.

LAURA: I rush forward a little bit to talk to him. Question. Your majesty? I want to help, we all want to help as much as possible, but I don't know any magic. Most of us don't. Are we going to be able to do anything?

MATT: “Well, I certainly hope so. If you've survived this long with my daughter, you've picked up a few tricks.”

LAURA: Well, that I have.

MARISHA: Father, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these people. They are the most capable that I know.

MATT: “This is good. Because that's who we need right now.”

MARISHA: However, since we're druids, we're a little bit more, you know. Geared. Prepared to deal with the fire. I can cast Protection from Energy on a couple of these people, if you wouldn't mind maybe grabbing the other two?

MATT: “I will do what I can.”

MARISHA: And I cast Protection from Fire on Percy, you have it, you have it, do you have it?

TRAVIS: Well, I really don't even know what I'm going to do here.

MARISHA: Well, it's going to protect you from fire.

TRAVIS: Okay.

MARISHA: Scanlan?

SAM: Hit me, babe.

MARISHA: I'll do Percy and Scanlan. Father, can you–?

MATT: It's a concentration spell, so you can only really have one person going, and that's your concentration.

MARISHA: Can only have one person going.

MATT: Yep.

TRAVIS: Well, good.

MARISHA: I could cast it at higher levels. Can I cast it at higher levels?

TRAVIS: I'll take a mulligan on this one.

MARISHA: Can't do that with this one? Fuck.

LAURA: Do Scanlan. Do Scanlan.

SAM: No, I'm fine, don't worry about me.

MARISHA: Well, I'm going to cast it on myself, for starters. Because I want it.

LAURA: All right.

MARISHA: So I'm going to cast Protection from Fire on myself.

LAURA: What does a potion of fire resistance do?

LIAM: Halves.

LAURA: The same thing?

LAURA and MARISHA: Halves all fire damage?

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: All right. As the cluster of you begin stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to approach the outskirts of the remnants of the Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And you start, as you're walking through, you can see where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock and volcanic material, and it isn't until your eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't escape in time, blending in with the ground and landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari continue pushing forward, not taking notice, focused, as before you, you can see the rift, still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves.

MARISHA: I turn and I look at them and nod and follow in my people's footsteps.

MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's session.

TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh shit.

TRAVIS: Okay. We're cooking with gas now.

LAURA: As Marisha collapses in a pool of tears.

TALIESIN: Cry more, cry more!

MATT: You knew this was coming.

LAURA: Yeah, man. You're going to have a headache tomorrow, dude.

MARISHA: I'm so tired. I'm tired.

LAURA: Aw, we've got exhaustion, Sam. That's balls.

SAM: Yeah, that's not great.

LIAM: Thanks for tuning in to Therapy Thursday, everyone.

TRAVIS: Where we take shits and talk to swords.

LAURA: There you go.

MATT: Got a little bit of column A, little bit of column B, we got some drama, we got some personal issues, we got some reunions, we got some hardships, we got–

TALIESIN: Wild animals.

LAURA: Yeah, so many things!

MATT: And a travel method for Trinket.

LAURA: Oh my god, I'm so excited about it!

MATT: I wasn't sure how you guys were going to use that one, as soon as you mentioned it I was like, all right, that's what they're doing. That's a way to do it. Yeah. Well cool, guys, we'll be back next week Thursday with Chris Hardwick, who will be joining us as a guest.

LAURA: Yay!

MARISHA: How is he going to be here?

TALIESIN: As himself. He's going to be playing himself, it's going to be very exciting.

TRAVIS: Guys, I'm a human. Usually.

LIAM: I'm super busy, I'm super busy.

TALIESIN: Out of the rift suddenly comes Chris Hardwick.

MARISHA: Super busy, but I'm super successful.

LIAM: I'll help save the world, but I got like 50 things on my schedule.

MATT: Yeah, so we'll be back then. I think April 21st is going to be our 50th episode. We're going to be doing a fun little evening there. We'll have Critmas coming up, probably end up being that night, maybe another night that week, we'll have details coming up soon, we're trying to figure out the schedule on that. This'll be our big 50th anniversary Critmas blowout, and then we're going to scale it back to like an annual-type event it looks like, both to save the people who work this channel Thursday nights and stay super later to get here, to save the length of the episodes, and to help all of us who have to then go to work sometimes very early the next morning.

LIAM: We love you, but I need to sleep. It's as simple as that. We love you, and we love Critmas, but it's a health thing.

MATT: So what we'll be doing is this will be our big blowout Critmas, we'll still do it probably for the holidays, and we really implore you guys to give to charities, send us stuff, we still read them, we'll still do Periscopes, those of us who get gifts, some of us will open them on Periscope for you, so we'll still have the interaction, we'll have to do it on our own time and not at 11, midnight.

TRAVIS: 12, 12:30.

LIAM: 12:37.

TALIESIN: On a 7AM call.

MATT: So this'll be our big general blowout. So if you're planning something for the next Critmas, this'll be the one to get it in for. But yeah, you can check out the guide to Critmas on Geek & Sundry, it has a list of all our supported charities if you want to give there. It's highly recommended. Thank you guys so much for those who donated to 826 tonight so we can go ahead and help out the Seattle branch.

MARISHA: 826 Seattle! We love you.

MATT: And yeah. Do we have anything else?

ALL: Happy St. Patty's Day.

LAURA: You guys are hopefully sitting at home being very good.

LIAM: For fuck's sake, take an Uber.

MATT: All right, guys. Well, have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Bye! 

Part I

MATT: All righty. So. Let's go ahead and jump into this wondrous–

TALIESIN: Oh, god.

MATT: So, to get you guys a little bit up to speed with some of the fun that's happened previously on Critical Role, our band of intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, after having a horrible encounter with the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic evil dragons that has just torn through the Tal'Dorei countryside, destroying cityscape after cityscape, the party has fled and has been seeking information on how to possibly eventually topple these creatures and restore order to the land of Tal'Dorei. They began seeking these artifacts known as the Vestiges of Divergence that promise ancient power from wars long past that could aid them in this journey. After acquiring one, with a near-death experience by Vex'ahlia over there, they began their next step in the journey. However, as part of a recent scrying spell by Keyleth, the druid, they discovered that the Pyrah tribe of her druidic heritage, the Ashari, were decimated as their home of Pyrah was the portal to the fire elemental plane that they normally guard, was where Thordak the Cinder King, the great red dragon, tore through into this prime realm and managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of the tribe. Vox Machina made the relatively grim journey back to the mountainside, finding it now brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity that previously lay dormant. Upon climbing the side of the mountain, you found remnants of the Pyrah tribe still alive, and making their way up the mountain, as damaged as they are, in hopes of sealing this now progressively swelling tear between the prime material plane and the elemental plane of fire. Not just that, there was aid that came to the Pyrah tribe. And it involved a number of Air Ashari, one of which was Korrin, Keyleth's father. There was a brief, tearful exchange and reunion before the rest of you, steeling yourselves, began to walk in towards the center of the mountain's caldera, towards the remnants of the Cindergrove, the now-destroyed and sundered petrified forest, in hopes of closing this rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for all. And this is where we begin. So. The group of the six of you, gathering alongside the dozen or so Pyrah members, with various burns, Cerkonos, who is the leader of the tribe, now missing his arm, cauterized at the shoulder, all advancing forward quietly in this tense push of necessity. You can see in the distance, swirling between the trees, clusters of glowing elemental entities that are either spilling forth from this recently and have taken this landscape as their own, or are just enjoying in their– elementals like to burn shit. And so you're seeing fire elementals wandering about, just tearing through what remains of this countryside, and let's see, you actually, Vex'ahlia– as you guys are stepping forward, keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities, these creatures, you catch out of the corner of your eye what appears to be a number of other humanoids, a small cluster of shadowed individuals far off to the left, tucked around the bottom of a tree.

LAURA: I ask everyone to wait. Percy.

TALIESIN: Yes?

LAURA: Can you look through your scope and see who that is?

TALIESIN: I'll take a look.

MATT: Make a perception check.

SAM: First roll.

TALIESIN: Ooh. That's not bad.

(eerie music)

LAURA: The music.

LIAM: The violins go south.

TALIESIN: 23.

MATT: 23. Glancing over in that direction, you see, towards one of the larger, broken petrified trees, right on the outskirts of the Cindergrove forest, you see what appear to be a cluster of humanoids. Two of them have flesh. The other two do not. These skeletal creatures shuffle in place, clutching a blade to one side, while the other two appear to be in partially rotted states. They're mostly disinterested in their surroundings and stand there, head to the side, aimless–

TALIESIN: Are they in the clothing of the natives, or do they not look to be Ashari?

MATT: From what you can tell, one of them does appear to have Ashari wardrobe. The other one does not.

TRAVIS: – he said in a weird way.

TALIESIN: They look undead. Doesn't–

LAURA: Are they from here?

TALIESIN: Possibly. One looks vaguely familiar, but there's something wrong. We should proceed– let's go up and find out what's happening. Slowly, and armed.

MATT: At this point, Korrin, Keyleth's father and the head of the Air Ashari in your absence, puts his hand forth and goes, “I'm sorry, you're saying that you see along the way undead creatures.”

TALIESIN: Yes. There's something unnatural over in that direction. We should probably be the ones to investigate.

MATT: “All right. Given the nature of the elemental presence here, we're going to have to probably divide and attack the central place from multiple positions, otherwise they're going to have too strong of a fire-front at the edges of this border. Do you feel confident enough to handle your own sliver of this assault?”

TRAVIS: (scoffs and laughs) Is he serious?

MARISHA: Grog. I believe we can handle it.

LAURA: We don't have a lot of magic wielders with us, though.

MATT: “That's all right–”

SAM: (clears throat) I'm pretty good.

LAURA: A lot of magic wielders.

TRAVIS: Yeah, you're better than good, buddy.

TALIESIN: You're okay.

MATT: “Well, we'll keep an eye out. We'll have two of our druids overhead, keeping eyesight. If anything goes wrong, signal up there. You know how, Keyleth. And we'll send them down to aid you. All right.”

LAURA: Sounds good.

MATT: “The air Ashari will come from the northeast. Cerkonos, take the rest of your tribe, head from the west. You, continue on forward. If this troupe you've found of seemingly lifeless entities looks even remotely dangerous, do not engage. They are not our target. But if this is a scourge that has spread into the Cindergrove, I fear we may be in worse shape than I had originally envisioned. Regardless, stay silent, stay swift.” He looks back to the rest of the Air Ashari, and all of them, their outer form shimmers as the wind begins to collect around their feet, ever so quietly, and they all with an intense speed begin to trek at an incredible pace, seemingly blending in with the rock surroundings as they go, disappearing around one side of the Cindergrove forest. Cerkonos and the others nod. Cerkonos looks to the rest of you, brings up his one hand and gives a touch to the top of his chest and sternum and bows his head and goes, “I wish you all great luck. See you on the inside.” And the rest of the fire Ashari turn into burning fire elemental forms and begin to streak through the various broken rocks and pieces of glass-shattered obsidian that peppered this landscape in the caldera, leaving the six of you ready to trek forward yourself.

TRAVIS: Scanlan, can you do that?

SAM: Ah, no. No, and I don't think I could learn.

TRAVIS: Oh.

LAURA: Perfect. So.

MARISHA: Let's go.

LAURA: Avoid the skeletons?

MARISHA: Avoid the skeletons.

TALIESIN: Let's take a look, at least.

MARISHA: What?

TALIESIN: We're supposed to make sure they're not part of something larger that's heading in–

LAURA: They're in the way, Keyleth.

MARISHA: Did you not just hear my father–

TALIESIN: He said if they don't bother us, to leave them alone, but that we should just check to make sure that they're not part of something.

LAURA: Are they in the path at all, do they look like they're going to be near us when we go?

MATT: They look like, wherever you're traveling– because there's an open expanse of about 80 or so feet before you actually reach the edge of the Cindergrove, and they're right on the outskirts of the Cindergrove forest, so lest you're very careful, they would technically see you if they're paying attention.

TRAVIS: Yes!

TALIESIN: Tread gently and see if they react.

MARISHA: Do you have Pass Without a Trace, Vex?

LAURA: I do. But, Keyleth, the minute we start fighting, they will notice us, and then they'll attack us from behind.

TALIESIN: So it would be best to get their attention now when everything's quiet.

MARISHA: We also don't want to waste all of our abilities on undead.

TALIESIN: There's only two, maybe four of them.

MATT: There's four of them.

LIAM: That we see.

MARISHA: Why don't we just tread that way, and we'll see what happens.

TALIESIN: That's exactly what we're saying.

SAM: What could happen?

LAURA: I guess I use Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

TALIESIN: You did.

MARISHA: Did we already have it?

LAURA: Did we already have it? From last time?

MATT: As long as you're maintaining your concentration, how long does it last for? Concentration? I believe it–

LAURA: It holds for up to an hour.

MATT: An hour, yeah, so you can still be under that effect.

LAURA: Sweet.

MATT: So I would like all six of you to roll stealth checks for me, if you could.

TRAVIS: With triple advantage?

MATT: No. Just the plus ten. Which is better than advantage.

MARISHA: Triple advantage.

TRAVIS: 25.

TALIESIN: 30.

MARISHA: 28.

LIAM: 38.

LAURA: 30.

MATT: 38–

SAM: 14.

(laughter)

MATT: With plus ten?

SAM: With the plus ten.

MATT: All right.

TRAVIS: Incredible.

SAM: Tra-la-la-la-la.

MATT: So as the entire group bends down into a ninja-like stance, just darting across as fast as they can, keeping low to the ground and using much of the shadow of the overhead clouds and smoke that has completely engulfed the above skyscape, behind you, bounding very loudly, is a gentle gnome, swishing brown hair–

SAM: I'm trying to do that thing that the Ashari just did.

MATT: Right. It's not working.

LIAM: Hot, hot, hot.

MATT: And as you're darting across, you're jumping over little open globules of molten lava that is starting to pour out from various crevices in the stone floor, you try to hop around to avoid that, and in doing so, your foot catches the edge of a piece of stone, and you begin to go into a tumble. Make an acrobatics check.

SAM: Oh, yes. Mm-hm. Oh, disadvantage, because I'm exhausted.

MATT: You are.

LAURA: Oh, shit. I forgot about that.

LIAM: The honest gnome.

SAM: Okay. 14.

MATT: (laughs) You do manage to catch yourself, with a slight tumble, skid a bit on your ass, and land on your feet. It would've been a cool three-point landing if anyone else had attempted it, but you just barely catch yourself, look back at the group with a sheepish grin, and out of the corner of your eye, you see one of the undead entities turn its head and look right in your direction.

LAURA: (whispering) Good job, Scanlan.

SAM: (whispering) I think it saw Grog.

TRAVIS: Sorry.

MATT: It starts wandering in your direction.

SAM: Should we engage or keep going?

MARISHA: I'm afraid if we engage, it could draw attention to an entire slew of what could be around.

TALIESIN: Let's just put it down quietly.

MARISHA: All right, Jesus Christ.

TALIESIN: No magic.

LAURA: No.

TALIESIN: Just weapons.

LAURA: No guns.

TALIESIN: No guns. I pull my sword.

MARISHA: Vex, you might be the most capable of this.

LAURA: I shoot it with an arrow.

MATT: All right, roll for an attack.

LAURA: Okay. Just going for it. Okay.

TRAVIS: Wow.

LAURA: I'm literally, I think I cursed myself sometime between here and San Francisco.

TALIESIN: The d20s talk to each other and they know that you're not true.

LAURA: 18.

MATT: 18. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

LIAM: Can I attack on her heels when she's done?

MATT: At this distance, it'll take a little bit to rush up if you want to–

LIAM: 60 feet.

MATT: I'll say at this point they're roughly 60 feet from you, so if you wanted to–

LIAM: That's my distance.

MATT: Oh, if you go full speed, you can.

MARISHA: Daggers.

MATT: Oh, throwing it.

LAURA: 15 damage.

MATT: 15 damage. On which one, the skeleton or–

LAURA: Oh, that's sneak attack, right? Because I'm hidden.

MATT: It would be from you, yes. The–

LAURA: Extra two.

MATT: What? Extra two. Okay. Is this against one of the zombies or one of the skeletons?

LAURA: I was doing the one that was walking towards us, I thought the other ones were still in the area–

MATT: All right, then that would be one of the zombies.

LAURA: Yeah, okay.

MATT: All right. The arrow streaks through the air, slamming into the chest, and it embeds itself, causing a piece of tendon to snap and curl back inside the torso. Its arm falls a little more limp than it was previously, and it just keeps walking forward.

LAURA: I hide.

MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a stealth check. You–

LIAM: They're all grouped together?

MATT: Three of them are grouped together by the tree. The one that noticed is slowly wandering toward you.

LIAM: All right, so I'm going to throw at that one as well.

MATT: Okay.

LAURA: 39. Stealth.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: I'm just going to throw one, and just to check, I'm hidden, yeah?

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: So this is Assassinate, I have advantage because it hasn't gone yet, and it's a crit because I'm surprising it.

MATT: Mm-hm.

LIAM: 25.

MATT: 25. With that, as this zombie entity is hobbling forward, the dagger strikes it right in the center of the skull, right where its mouth and jaw hinge hit, severs the base of the skull to the spine, and the head just rolls off onto the ground underneath. The body takes two more steps before falling forward.

LAURA: Yeah, do they all– did any of the other ones notice that?

MATT: All the other undead creatures all of a sudden turn into the forest, as opposed to towards where the death happened–

LAURA: Ah, shit.

MATT: And you see running out from the forest towards you, a blue-skinned humanoid, rushing out, arms in the air.

CHRIS: (in an Irish accent) Stop, stop, stop what you're doing! Stop it! What have you done? What have you fucking done? It wasn't hurting anybody! I don't understand it. Jesus Christ, these are not easy to make.

TRAVIS: Are we killing this one?

SAM: No, no, don't kill him, he's precious.

CHRIS: What did I do?

SAM: Who are you? Who are you?

CHRIS: Who are you, you're fucking shooting at me, you're asking me questions!

SAM: But these are zombies, these are undead, these are creatures of evil!

LAURA: They were attacking us, they were attacking him!

CHRIS: These were in my employ.

SAM: Oh.

LAURA: Well, you should keep a leash on them, then.

CHRIS: That would be inhumane, wouldn't it?

SAM: They're not human.

CHRIS: Well, they were, that's very disrespectful of you, I don't appreciate it.

LIAM: Are they pets? Are they friends? Where were you–

CHRIS: They're friend-pets.

LIAM: You have to be around, though. To keep an eye on them.

CHRIS: I know, but I've been traveling out here for a while, and so they provide a layer of protection. Certainly not great now. Now they were four, now there's three.

LIAM: Well, listen, when we see these things without an owner around, we take them out, I'm sorry, it's pretty standard.

SAM: This can't be the first time this has happened.

CHRIS: It does happen quite a lot, actually, yes. Now that I think about it, it's probably a little bit on me, I suppose.

SAM: Can you make them vests or something that says 'service'?

CHRIS: That's a nice idea, as I'm a vest-maker.

LAURA: Put them in a bright color, put a happy mask on them or something, so people know they're nice.

CHRIS: Certainly, yeah, yeah, masks and vests, that's a great idea.

MATT: You see agreeing before you a blue-scaled dragonborn. If you would like to describe yourself for the party.

CHRIS: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Where are my manners? My name is Gern Blanston.

SAM: No, it's not.

CHRIS: It's Gern Blanston.

TALIESIN: Oh my god.

CHRIS: This one's very rude.

TRAVIS: He is.

CHRIS: You look exhausted.

SAM: This volcano– do you live near here? This volcano really takes the piss out of you.

CHRIS: No, no, no, I don't live near here. Listen, I've been traveling, I'm a simple candlemaker.

SAM: What are you doing on top of a volcano?

CHRIS: A volcano is nature's candle! What a stupid question.

LAURA: You make candles, but you also make undead?

CHRIS: Yes. They're– yes. They're like people-candles.

LAURA: Can I insight and see if he's telling the truth?

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: Our lives are so bizarre now.

LAURA: 17.

MATT: 17. He's telling the truth.

CHRIS: Why is my brain tingling? Is someone noodling around inside there?

MATT: She eyes you up and down, trying to get a feel for whether or not you're who you say you are.

CHRIS: I make special candles. I make special candles. I'm searching for some magical items up here in this volcano. I understand there was a wee bit of damage not long ago from a dragon that had torn through the region, and so I'm just searching for scraps to make these simple candles. That's why– this is my dance vest. I think dancing is very important. I'm alone most of the time, it keeps me occupied. They have no appreciation for the arts, these undead creatures that are friend-pets, and, you know, I've just been digging around up here, seeing what I can scrounge up and find. What are you lot?

TRAVIS: Wait, are they special candles or are they simple candles?

CHRIS: Well, some are simple. Some just create light, and others create tragedy for people.

SAM: They're magical candles?

CHRIS: Yes, in a word. Actually, magic is the perfect word.

MARISHA: Who exactly is the patronage of your candle business? Who do you sell to?

CHRIS: I mean, I sell to no one in particular, really. I have to be a little choosy about who gets the candles, but it's something that I've crafted over the years.

SAM: Well, we feel dreadful about killing one of your pets.

MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

SAM: Perhaps we can purchase a candle off of you to make amends.

CHRIS: Well, maybe you could just kill someone else, and then I could just bring them back, I mean, that would be a wonderful way to repay.

LAURA: Well, you know what, we're on our way to do just that thing.

CHRIS: Really?

MARISHA: Things do tend to die around us a lot.

TRAVIS: Something larger things, sometimes smaller things.

SAM: Would you like a body to reanimate or something?

MARISHA: You might get something even bigger.

CHRIS: Are you inviting me to come along with you?

SAM: I don't know. Are we?

CHRIS: Did I just invite myself to come along with you?

TRAVIS: Well maybe, like, if you give us one of those tragedy candles, we can always light it for somebody. That could be good down the road.

MARISHA: Oh, like candles for funerals? That's sad. We do have a lot of tragedy.

TRAVIS: We bake somebody a cake, we shove a candle in the top, and we give it to them.

CHRIS: I don't think that would be a grand idea unless you didn't like the person very much.

TRAVIS: Well, that's what I meant, yeah.

CHRIS: Well, I think for now I'll just hold onto the candles I have and just see how things pan out. I really don't know any of you.

SAM: We're Vox Machina, a traveling band of adventurers led by me, Scanlan Shorthalt, and these are my compatriots. We're on a very important mission to get– what are we doing?

MARISHA: We're trying to close this giant rift that we're walking into.

SAM: We have to break something big and scary.

CHRIS: What's your name again?

SAM: Scanlan Shorthalt.

CHRIS: No, what's the name of your group?

LAURA: Vox Machina.

CHRIS: No offense, but that sounds like a shite band.

LAURA: Thank you.

CHRIS: Are you musicians?

TALIESIN: It's better than Tragedy Candle, really, I mean that's a shite band, to be fair.

CHRIS: (laughs) They opened for Vox Machina. They were fantastic. Oh, am I not thinking of the right thing? That's all right.

SAM: I'm a musician.

CHRIS: Excellent.

SAM: But these people, they can't really hold a tune so much.

CHRIS: Listen, seeing as how that you've killed one of my undead thralls, it'd be really nice if I could join you to see if maybe we can scrounge up some other things along the way.

LAURA: Then you'll help us?

CHRIS: I mean, we'll see how it pans out, but I feel like everything would come to an abrupt ending if I just walked away at this point.

LAURA: It would be very strange.

CHRIS: Thoroughly unsatisfying for anyone else who might be witnessing this exchange.

SAM: Your undead pets, are they going to try and eat our brains or anything?

CHRIS: No, no, they're just fine. That right there is Coral, and that's Stimpy, and that's Fatty Arbuckle.

SAM: Who was the one that we killed?

CHRIS: Oh, that was Carol. Very sad, very sad indeed.

LAURA: Carol and Coral?

CHRIS: Carol and Coral. I get them confused.

MARISHA: Were they sisters?

CHRIS: No, no, no, they were not initially related, but we became a makeshift family after a while.

SAM: Oh, that's very beautiful.

CHRIS: I notice subtle differences that most of the living doesn't notice.

TRAVIS: Aren't we supposed to be doing something really like–

LAURA: Yeah, tell you what, Gern, we're actually–

LIAM: It's dangerous around us, I don't know–

LAURA: We should probably press on, and you can join us with your family.

CHRIS: Please, that would be very nice.

TRAVIS: What was your name, one more time?

CHRIS: Gern Blanston.

TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

CHRIS: Gern.

TRAVIS: Well, let's go, let's move along then, Gern, yeah? You good to come along with your herd of–

SAM: Can you fight and stuff in case shit goes down?

MARISHA: If you make magical candles, you must know a little bit of magic, correct?

CHRIS: I'm a little bit better of a spellcaster than I am a fisticuffs type of person.

MARISHA: Okay.

LAURA: Perfect. We're short on magic people. That's wonderful.

CHRIS: Excellent. No offense.

SAM: All taken.

TRAVIS: We move along.

LAURA: Are we still trying to stealth? Or does it even matter?

LIAM: Your dead things don't stealth, I would assume?

CHRIS: They're not very delicate, unfortunately. No, no, they're really for protection. Now, the zombies can really take a lot of damage to the front of the chest and the skeletons are quite quick, actually. So, you know. They've been fairly good for a while.

LAURA: All right.

TALIESIN: Good to know.

LAURA: We head towards the thing.

TRAVIS: Stealthily.

CHRIS: To the thing!

TRAVIS: Shush! Stealthily.

CHRIS: (whispering) To the thing!

MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check, if you don't mind, Gern.

LAURA: Does my Pass Without a Trace work on him too, does it like envelop him–

MATT: Nope. He wasn't there when you cast it.

CHRIS: 11.

TRAVIS: Fuck.

MATT: 11?

TALIESIN: He's not under Pass Without a Trace.

MATT: No, and then– No. As you guys begin stealthily, there is a couple of (footfalls) heavy footfalls of the lumbering dragonborn.

CHRIS: These old dragon feet–

MATT: No tail on this one.

SAM: What happened to your tail?

CHRIS: Please don't ask me about that.

SAM: Okay, I won't.

MATT: The only other dragonborn you've seen without a tail was the paladin that worked in the Council. Tofor Brotorus. So, that does catch your attention a little bit. Not just the dragonborn lumbering, but now the three undead that are (groaning) stepping behind.

LAURA: They're worse than Trinket, Scanlan.

MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know if stealth is going to be a thing, going forward.

TALIESIN: (whistling)

TRAVIS: Yeah! (whistles)

LAURA: Okay.

CHRIS: Sorry, these dragon lips can't whistle. Mostly just fire comes out.

MATT: And it's at that point you hear the cracking of what sounds like heavy timber, no more than 30 feet away from you. You all stop in place suddenly and you glance over and you can see the flickering of light of what appears to be a flame-based elemental energy that's tearing over the side of a newly fallen petrifoid– petrifoid– (mocking Chris' accent) petrifoid tree, look what you've done to me! This is your fault!

TRAVIS: Gern, son of a bitch.

CHRIS: Purple hearts, green stars! Purple hearts.

SAM: Seen some shit.

CHRIS: Special veteran's edition of Lucky Charms.

MATT: Very, very Lucky Charms.

CHRIS: Very Lucky Charms.

LIAM: Shit.

MATT: So!

TALIESIN: Well, that got dark.

MATT: Yeah, how about that?

LIAM: Back to normal, then, eh?

TALIESIN: Yeah, okay.

MATT: So. As the flame begins to trickle and burn over the edge, you can see there is an intelligence to it. There are a couple of arms that writhe over the side and the head pops over and glances, and stops in place, frozen, staring over in the direction of the bounding dragonborn.

MARISHA: It's a fire elemental?

MATT: It's smaller than what you're used to seeing, but it is indeed a creature made of elemental flame.

MARISHA: Would he be considered a primordial?

MATT: It would be considered an elemental.

MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go fire elemental.

MATT: Okay. So you're using your transform–

MARISHA: Seeing it, I'm going to transform and go into my fire elemental.

TRAVIS: Is this the first time you've done that?

LAURA: No no, she's done that.

MARISHA: Is this the first time I've been fire elemental?

MATT: I think it's the first time you've been fire elemental, yeah?

LAURA: Really?

MARISHA: Yeah, learned from Cerkonos, yeah.

MATT: So, you guys watch as Keyleth's form suddenly erupts into flame, which freaks you out for a second, as you're uncertain as to whether or not she did that.

TRAVIS: Keyleth! Are you all right?

MARISHA: In fire elemental, just like–

LAURA: Does it still look like Keyleth or– what does it look like?

MATT: It has for a moment, an essence of Keyleth's more lithe form that most elementals would, but still these long, curling flame like-arms, these eyes that glow a bright white fire in the center of the face. Other than that, relatively formless other than what looks like where her hair would be, these wisps of flame curl up behind her.

LAURA: Pretty freaking sick. Can you talk to it?

MARISHA: That's what I'm going to go do.

MATT: So as you approach the elemental form–

MARISHA: So I approach and I'm going to do the animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself a little big.

MATT: The creature behind the form, you can see, is drifting away from the trunk of the tree.

MARISHA: Oh, it's running from me?

MATT: It's turned away and is moving away from you, yeah.

SAM: That was easy.

MARISHA: Deuces. And I roll back.

LAURA: I thought we were supposed to keep them from coming out into this world.

MARISHA: Are we– wait. Are we in the fire plane yet?

MATT: No no, you're just– you're in the caldera to–

MARISHA: Oh, we're in the caldera.

MATT: Yeah, you haven't traversed the plane. You're making your way into the remnants of the Cindergrove.

LAURA: Maybe you should ask it to go back.

MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to say “Halt!” in Ignan. Which I'm assuming it speaks.

MATT: You guys hear in the distance this echo of this weird sucking-crackling sound that goes– It halts for a second, looks over its shoulder and then goes into double speed, disappearing into the trees. Away from you.

TRAVIS: Kind of following your lead here.

MARISHA: I follow after it and I say, in the name of the guardians of this realm, you will stop!

MATT: Okay, as you follow it past the initial treeline, it's where a bunch of trees have fallen over and formed a small blockade in this portion of the forest. You glance over as you're shouting that and you can see what appear to be another of the same small elemental that this one has gone to, to have a brief conversation. Beyond that, you see a larger one, roughly your size, that has just turned around and noticed your presence, and all of them look over at what appears to be another humanoid creature, but instead of a lower torso of legs, it's an elongated snake-like body, its black and red scales across its entire form, two human arms and a humanoid face but these webbed red spines down its entire back.

SAM: Gern, is that one of yours? That's you, Gern. Gern.

CHRIS: No, I don't know who this is. I don't– I'm not familiar. I'm not familiar with who this is.

LAURA: I take my potion of fire resistance.

CHRIS: I could send them a present in the form of a candle, if you prefer.

LAURA: Do it.

MATT: At this point in time, Keyleth, as you're standing there, looking over this edge, they all turn and the creature, the weird– I'll say it– a salamander-like creature, begins shouting out phrases in Ignan, which you understand. It says, “Go! He's not here yet! Alleviate this uncontrolled one!” At which point, they all begin to swarm towards you.

MARISHA: At which point I'm going to do a fire intimidation tactic. I'm going to do a fire radial thing. And I'm going to say, as the leader of this realm, as the Kaitaki of the Fire Nation, you will heed my word.

CHRIS: Quite dramatic, isn't she?

MATT: As you guys are watching this from a distance, all you hear is (guttural noises). It's really confusing and a little hilarious, to be honest.

LAURA: I think it's going well.

MATT: I need you to make an intimidation check.

MARISHA: No, that one fails me a lot.

TRAVIS: Yeah, sure it fails you.

MATT: What you got, Keyleth?

MARISHA: It does! Shut up, Travis. Natural 20!

TRAVIS: Ha. Thought I made a point.

MATT: All right. As this happens, the two smaller elementals shrink down and glance over at the larger one. The larger one looks about and shouts back at you in Ignan, once again: “Do you serve him?”

MARISHA: It doesn't matter who I serve, for I am above him. I am your master now. This is not your realm. Get back into the fire plane. Where you came from.

MATT: He looks back at the long snake-like humanoid who's standing there who glances at the other one and goes, “She wants us back. Very well.” And they all turn around and begin to slowly drift back towards the center of the Cindergrove where the flickering light was.

MARISHA: Holy shit.

LAURA: Good job, Keyleth!

TRAVIS: We don't know what happened, why are we clapping?

LAURA: They're turning around, they're heading back in that direction!

MARISHA: I fly back over to them, still in fire elemental form–

LIAM: Whoa whoa whoa!

MARISHA: And I'm like: You guys! Did you see that! It was really crazy! Did you see? Did you see? They think I'm their leader! They think I'm their god!

TRAVIS: Is she talking in normal, or is she talking in the (flickering flames).

MATT: (flickering flames)

TRAVIS: Yeah, no idea what you're doing or saying.

LAURA: You're very scary right now, dear.

CHRIS: Is she going to be sick?

TRAVIS: I think so. I might have to tackle you if you don't calm the fuck down.

MARISHA: I chill out. I chill out, I can't revert back, though, guys, because I want to stay in this.

MATT: So the fire elemental is just like (calm whoosh). And it's more of a smoldering sad elemental at the moment.

MARISHA: I give them a fire thumbs-up.

MATT: There you go. Strong sad elemental.

LIAM: First word. Two syllables.

TRAVIS: So, they're going back. Do we move on?

LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to take off, leading in my fire elemental form, deeper towards the rift. Keeping my eye out for any elementals that might be escaping.

MATT: All right.

TALIESIN: This is her game.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's on fire.

MATT: Go ahead and make a sleight of hand check.

LAURA: What?

CHRIS: 18.

MATT: Okay. Vex, make a perception check.

TRAVIS: Roll high.

LAURA: Pressure!

TALIESIN: Use one of your good dice.

LAURA: Perception.

LIAM: And roll bad.

LAURA: Shut up.

TALIESIN: Should've used the good dice.

LAURA: 30. No. 28.

MATT: 28?

SAM: Yep! Wait, are you exhausted?

MATT: Yeah, you are.

LAURA: On everything?

MATT: Skill check. Roll again.

LAURA: No, even better!

TRAVIS: Even better.

LIAM: So it's the earlier.

MATT: So it's the earlier one, yeah. Okay. You just see, as you're all just walking along, your new blue dragonborn friend just reaches down and snatches something from the dirt, pockets it and keeps walking.

LAURA: I follow behind him and keep watching him. Can I see what it was?

MATT: You have no idea. You just see a little cluster of ash and dust on the ground that's been partially disturbed. All right. As you continue to press forward, you hear in the distance a loud cracking sound echoing, and you can see what appear to be a number of trees in the far-off side to the northeastern side of the forest, as a brief whirlwind flickers up. You assume this is probably from the Fire Ashari, who've taken that side of the entranceway, and you can see two flickering lights drift up in the air before sparking out in the distance.

TRAVIS: Ooh, really?

LAURA: Should we let them know we're in place, then?

MARISHA: I'll throw up a Skywrite. Or actually, as a fire elemental, can I just be like (fire flares) in fire elemental form?

MATT: I mean, you can make some localized fire happen.

MARISHA: Can I send up a little bit like a flare?

MATT: Not in the way you would want to, you'd have to drop form for that and cast a spell.

MARISHA: Fuck.

LAURA: I'm going to set an arrow on fire and shoot it up in the air.

MARISHA: I don't realize she's doing it.

MATT: Okay. As you go ahead and take the arrow– What do you have around the edge that are going to– are you just going to light the shaft on fire?

LAURA: No, I'm going to tie some of my cloth from– you know– that I have– The thing.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: I take some cloth from the Bag of Holding, from one of those old fancy cloaks that we have.

TRAVIS: Better ask first.

LAURA: (sighs) Seriously?! Can I have some of the fancy cloak? Grog, out of the Bag of Holding, please?

TRAVIS: Oh, are you hot right now? It's so weird.

LAURA: Jesus Christ. Please.

TRAVIS: Oh, all right. Fancy cloak.

MATT: There you go. The arrow arcs off. Vanishes across the little bit of the remaining treeline.

LAURA: No idea if they saw that.

MATT: All right. Do you guys continue to press forward?

MARISHA: Hold for a second. And wait for Team Three's response?

SAM: There's a third team?

MARISHA: Right, there's a third team. Three teams, right?

LAURA: All the other teams already responded. We were the third.

MARISHA: Oh! One, two, we were three. Okay, yeah.

MATT: Okay. You begin to push further forward towards the center of the Cindergrove, as you're noticing more and more of these trees are pushed flat. It's almost like that Russian forest the meteor had landed in and exploded; all the trees are flattened–

CHRIS: Tunguska.

MATT: Think Tunguska, thank you. Where you begin to climb over a number of these flattened portions of the forest, and in the center you can see that one river of molten rock that had been trickling down the front of the mountain is sourced here in the center, where once previously you guys had performed a ritual to pass into the elemental plane, has now torn into this extremely bright rift that flickers. It's like looking into the sun, you have to avert your gaze; you cannot look directly at it without actually hurting your eyesight. And you can see, there are multiple paths of this molten lava, pouring out from this new volcanic activity. You can see it burbling up and bubbling underneath, like the very presence of this tear itself is causing the activity to just raise and grow more fervent. At the base of the rift, you can see a number of other elemental creatures that are in the process of surrounding this opening– (door creak)

MATT: – and you can– Everything all right, Ryan?

RYAN: I am not here.

MATT: You're not here, okay?

SAM: You don't know.

MATT: I don't know.

CHRIS: You guys see him too?

MATT: Perfect. As you can see, all these elemental entities are swirling around. There are two more of these strange, snake-like humans, these salamander-like creatures that are discussing, and one really large one that stands there holding this strange trident-like structure, and it's shouting out commands left and right, and you can see these salamander entities and a number of these elementals are all gathered around the portal, and they're all just focusing this slow, steady beam towards it. And as you can see it tearing, flickering and slowly expanding with each popping expansion of this doorway, the ground itself shifts and rumbles.

LAURA: I Hunter's Mark the big one.

MATT: All right.

CHRIS: Can I send a candle?

MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

CHRIS: All right, what am I looking at, here? Fire? There's a bit of fire?

MATT: There's a lot of fire. Most of these entities are either fire essence or just made out of straight flame.

CHRIS: I'd like to call over the skeleton known as Fatty Arbuckle. I'd like to give Fatty Arbuckle an Ice Storm Candle.

MATT: All right.

CHRIS: And ask him to kindly deliver it to the center of this melee that's happening just up ahead.

SAM: Won't that kill your friend?

CHRIS: Oh. He's had a good run.

TALIESIN: I'm feeling a lot less guilty, suddenly.

CHRIS: Well, I can do it! What I don't appreciate is when other people do it.

SAM: That's fair. That's fair.

CHRIS: You know, it's my choice. Never said it was okay for you to start lighting them up with arrows. Jesus Christ, whoever that is.

LAURA: I'm Vex'ahlia, nice to meet you.

MATT: Fatty Arbuckle, skeletal claws clasped around the side of this marbled-looking, bluish-white candle, and clutches it and just goes (snarl).

CHRIS: Yes, off you trot, go!

SAM: You don't have to demean him as he goes.

TALIESIN: I was really hoping for a Fatty Arbuckle skeleton impression. I was really, really hoping for it. What you did was cool, but like, that was just my heart.

CHRIS: They can't speak. They don't have voice boxes or anything.

MATT: As it shuffles forward, down this ashen pit towards the dome where the lava itself is beginning to pour forth and the doorway is, you can see the shadow of its form as the light passes. It looks like the cover of The Thing, how it's just bright light coursing past this dark image of the skeleton, walking away from you.

LAURA: Maybe we should duck down, so that nobody knows where that came from.

CHRIS: Oh, yes, get ten feet back, I should've said that already.

MATT: It's walked quite a distance, thankfully, at this point. It's probably a good 40 or 50 feet before it reaches the first salamander. And you see, as it begins to step forward, they all turn and look, and one of them shouts over (snarling). One of them glances over, reaches out and pulls out a long, brass-colored longbow and begins to notch an arrow carefully, as it hobbles forward. They look at each other. One of them shouts out in Ignan, which you understand, Keyleth, shouting, “You! Who walks here?” Just keeps walking forward like a little wind-up toy made of bone. Until eventually, the one with the bow gives a nudge with its head, and the other salamander entity draws a heavy-bladed object and begins to step forward towards it, ready to go ahead and cleave it. As the skeleton steps forward, it gets right at the corner of its range. Do you want to command it?

MARISHA: I feel like Helen Hunt in that moment in Twister.

CHRIS: Squeeze the candle, Fatty Arbuckle!

MATT: At which point, the skeleton, just as the blade sweeps past and crashes into its torso, shattering the rib cage, the arms go (crack). The wax bends and cracks in the center, and there's a brief pause where nothing seems to happen. And a swirl of sudden, localized storming blizzard just encases a ten-foot radius, hitting both of those salamander creatures. What does it say on the candle specifically?

CHRIS: On the Ice Storm Candle. All affected must make a dexterity saving throw, DC 12, or suffer 4d6 cold damage.

MATT: That's a fail and a save. And it's half damage on success?

CHRIS: Half damage on success.

MATT: Great. Okay, so one of them failed and one of them saved. So go ahead and roll 4d6 damage.

TRAVIS: Dang. I think that's a good way to start.

CHRIS: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh boy. Three, six, nine.

MATT: Nine? Okay, nine and five cold damage to each. So (bang) it blasts open. Oh, and a dexterity check for your buddy, who makes it! So, Fatty Arbuckle actually walks out of there with a mere five points of cold damage.

LAURA: Nice, Fatty!

MATT: Out of ice and frost. His busted-open rib cage, though, he did suffer…

LIAM: Super duper!

TRAVIS: Putting on the Ritz!

MATT: Did suffer seven damage from the impact of this weapon. So Fatty Arbuckle, pretty damaged, but still standing there just going (snarling).

CHRIS: Keep standing, Fatty, you can do it! I love you, Fatty!

MATT: Is everyone just going to sit back at this, or–?

LAURA: No, we should probably attack.

MATT: It's up to you. Or you can watch this horrible bludgeoning of this skeleton in the teeth of death.

TRAVIS: When I see the salamander take out the big, shiny sharp thing, I go into a rage.

LAURA: I hide.

MATT: All right. Travis, I assume you're going to be rushing in there, then?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Anyone who wishes to immediately go into battle now, let's roll initiative.

TALIESIN: All right. I'm in on this.

MATT: All right. Let me go ahead and–

SAM: For Fatty!

MARISHA: So these are all fire elementals. Should I continue–

TALIESIN: Oh, hell yeah.

CHRIS: Ah, nice.

LAURA: Should we roll for stealth again, or are we still stealthed?

CHRIS: I was just shouting at a skeleton.

LAURA: Oh, I know, I was trying to hide, though. Like, back away from you as you were doing that.

TRAVIS: The candle turned into a blizzard, so. Ooh!

TALIESIN: Is it a candle, though? It's like a thing, like there's no–

LIAM: And I mean, Gern was shouting.

TALIESIN: It's a candle the way the wheelie things are hoverboards. I think it's weird.

CHRIS: And they also catch on fire. They also explode.

MATT: All right, so this is quite a ways away from the portal itself. Lava flow traveling around that side.

TALIESIN: Oh, look at that!

MATT: All right, and we have Keyleth over here as the fire elemental.

LAURA: You're at the portal.

MARISHA: Huh?

LAURA: That's okay. We're all going to die.

TRAVIS: No.

TALIESIN: Where's the big one?

MATT: The big one that you haven't seen yet?

LAURA: The big one that I Hunter's Marked.

TALIESIN: That one. The one holding the tridenty thing.

MATT: Oh, sorry.

TALIESIN: Thank you.

LAURA: Whoa. Look at how pretty those lava bubbles look!

SAM: Is that Gern?

MATT: That's Gern right there.

We have Fatty Arbuckle.

TALIESIN: Fatty!

MATT: And chilling over here, we have Coral and Stimpy.

TRAVIS: What is that crater? Is that just a crater?

LIAM: I think that's the portal they were trying to–

SAM: So these are fire elementals, yes?

MATT: They seem to be fire-based creatures, yes.

LIAM: Hey, DM!

MATT: Yes.

LIAM: You said they were ripping open the portal? Where is that on the map?

MATT: It's back, it's this far back.

LIAM: Way back, okay.

TRAVIS: That crater's just a crater, though?

MATT: Yeah. There is a pool of magma that goes this way. You guys are on one side of it, and pushing this way further, the rest of the actual portal's back this far. All right. So, initiative order, we have 25 to 20, anyone?

SAM: 22.

TALIESIN: 27.

TRAVIS: Fucking Percy. Jesus. Every time. You motherfucker.

TALIESIN: I'm fast as fuck.

MATT: Okay. 20 to 15.

TRAVIS: 17.

CHRIS: 19.

LIAM: 16. Carl!

MATT: All right.

LAURA: 13.

MATT: 13. Keyleth?

MARISHA: Four.

MATT: All right, great. So, top of the round, Percy, you're up first.

TALIESIN: First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my pistol. I'm going to do a trick shot for the arms. Actually, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to– you know, actually, I'm going to hold off on that. I'm going to make an arm shot to the one with the trident.

MATT: All righty.

TALIESIN: That was my first shot. And that's 25.

MATT: 25 hits.

TALIESIN: And that's a strength saving throw.

MATT: Strength saving throw. That is going to be a 20.

TALIESIN: That just barely makes it.

MATT: Aw. The blast of your impact (bang) hits the arm. He manages to hold onto his trident-like weapon.

TALIESIN: That's fine. He's going to take his damage, and then he's going to take another one of those, because eff that.

MATT: All righty. So go ahead and roll damage on that.

TRAVIS: Because eff that.

TALIESIN: That's 13 points of damage.

MATT: 13 points of damage. All righty.

TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to take another shot.

MATT: Go for it. Scanlan, you're up on deck, by the way, so be ready.

TALIESIN: 20.

MATT: 20 hits.

TALIESIN: Strength check.

MATT: That's a nine.

TALIESIN: He dropped that.

MATT: Failure. (gunshot) You see his fingers are pried off as one of his pinky fingers is actually blown off from the impact, shooting dark, deep crimson blood that seems to burn the landscape around as it drips, the trident tumbling to the ground and getting lodged in a piece of rock, almost ready to spill into part of the lava.

TALIESIN: And that does seven points of damage.

MATT: Seven points of damage, all righty.

TALIESIN: Third shot's going to be a sharpshooter shot.

MATT: All righty. So minus five to the attack.

TALIESIN: That's probably going to miss. 14.

MATT: 14, unfortunately, misses.

TALIESIN: All right. That misses. I'm going to take a run behind and hide behind that rock outcropping.

MATT: There? Okay. Got it. Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Do I see that big thing in the back?

MATT: This big thing here? Yeah, the fire elemental. You see that.

SAM: Okay. And the thing next to Fatty Arbuckle is also a baddie, yeah? They're all baddies?

MATT: These things are all baddies here.

SAM: All right. I'm going to take 15 feet, step to my right to put me in a straight line with the guy next to Fatty and the big guy behind him. And then fire a Lightning Bolt straight ahead to hit both of them. I hope they're not immune to lightning. We'll find out.

MATT: All righty. So, and you watch out of the corner as well, Gern, you see this tiny little gnome step to the side, conjure some arcane purplish-blue energy, and then thrust his pelvis forward as a bolt of lightning energy just rockets forth, tearing–

SAM: From my penis.

CHRIS: Nice. Of course.

SAM: Just felt like I had to make that clear.

CHRIS: Oh, I don't think I've ever seen that happen before.

TALIESIN: We have.

LAURA: So many times.

CHRIS: Have to get that looked at.

MATT: Slamming both into the larger salamander creature and the elemental behind it. Go ahead and roll 8d6 damage. What's the DC on this?

SAM: Is it my spell save DC?

MATT: Yes.

SAM: With the hand-cone?

MATT: Yeah.

SAM: 20.

MATT: Ooh! That is a failure and a failure!

TRAVIS: Yes!

MATT: All right. So full damage against both.

SAM: 27.

MATT: Oof. All righty. As the bolt of lightning energy tears through both of them, eventually absorbed into the stone behind them, the elemental flame form flickers and falls to the ground for a second, trying to reform itself, while the salamander looks down at this blackened, burned char mark in the center of its torso from where the bolt entered and exited out of its back to strike its compadre. Not too happy, and confused how such a large, damaging thing came from such a small little creature.

SAM: It's powerful. Then I'll turn to our new friend Gern, and I will inspire him. I'll say, please, help us, and to inspire you I will sing you a song. And I will sing–

CHRIS: Pretty inspired by your dick lightning, to be honest.

SAM: Oh, there's more.

CHRIS: You think a song's going to get better than that?

SAM: It might! It might. And so I sing (singing): To everything, Gern, Gern, Gern. There is a season, Gern, Gern, Gern. I just like to sing your name, Gern Blanston. Did that help?

CHRIS: Do I have to roll to determine if that was helpful or not?

MATT: If you'd like to.

CHRIS: Certainly.

MATT: Roll a d20 for musical taste.

CHRIS: Four.

MATT: Four. It catches you by the ear with delight.

CHRIS: It's not bad, actually. It's not bad.

MATT: Your general frustration with modern music is completely bisected by the more oldies, classical sound of his tune.

CHRIS: I quite enjoyed how you worked my first name into that, actually. No one's ever done that before.

MATT: So you get a d10 inspiration dice.

CHRIS: All right.

MATT: So just keep that on the side. If ever you make an attack roll or a saving throw that isn't as high as you want it to be, you can then roll that and add the d10 to that roll.

CHRIS: Okay, great.

MATT: So you just have that in the wings, as you feel inspired.

TALIESIN: We'll try and remind you if something affects it.

CHRIS: Thank you very much. Excellent.

MATT: All right. That brings it to the elementals' turn. Now, this flame elemental is going to streak over (whoosh) to Blern who's– or, no, sorry, this is to Fatty Arbuckle. There's too many weird names tonight. And this larger fire elemental here is going to–

CHRIS: Oh, Fatty. He served me well.

SAM: I don't know, he's got a fighting chance. I love that we were scrambling for d6's when we have this right in front of us.

CHRIS: Are there any dice around anywhere?

SAM: Where are we going to find…?

TALIESIN: I'm just waiting for the hand to go in and just–

CHRIS: I found this polyhedral vase and I had to fill it with nine pounds of dice.

TRAVIS: He went the long way.

MATT: He's not doing anything, he used his whole round to get there.

TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

MATT: But now, as the larger elemental burns into the center of Scanlan, Percy, you can feel, just his presence itself is extremely, dangerously hot. The air around you is blistering. You can feel your hair curl back in its presence. The small elemental is going to go ahead and make two attacks against Fatty Arbuckle.

CHRIS: Ah, shite.

MATT: That's going to be a nine to hit. I think his AC's 13, so I don't think it's going to hit, yeah. Second one rolls a one.

SAM: Fatty lives!

TRAVIS: Fatty just don't want to die.

TALIESIN: Can't keep Fatty down.

LIAM: Bob and weave, Fatty, bob and weave!

CHRIS: Don't step too hard, Fatty! You won't be able to take it!

MATT: And with that, Grog, it's your turn. So you go into your rage at the top of your turn, and then what would you like to do?

TRAVIS: Can I use, I guess, my entire action to run towards Scanlan?

MATT: What's your speed again?

TRAVIS: 50.

MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. You can get right there between Scanlan and this creature if you want to.

TRAVIS: That's about it, huh?

MATT: I'd say that's your movement. You can move ten more feet if you want to.

SAM: You can leap over me.

TRAVIS: Nah, we need to spread out. Can I go back and arc the other way? Can I run to the left as far as I can?

MATT: This way?

TRAVIS: No, from where my starting point was.

MATT: Oh, you mean like this way instead?

TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, back towards you, around the pool.

MATT: That's about as far as you can get, right there. If you do not attack anything, you would lose your rage.

TRAVIS: I fall out of my rage, yeah. So I fall out of it. Can I throw something? I guess I can, yeah.

MATT: You can throw your weapon if you want to.

TRAVIS: Can I attach the Chain of Returning to Craven Edge? And I'll throw it at trident-less bastard right there, yeah.

MATT: Go for it. So you watch as this muscle-bound goliath comes leaping around the corner as it affixes a chain to the edge of its weapon, flinging a two-handed sword like a giant boomerang and–

TRAVIS: Only 14.

MATT: 14, against the larger one?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MATT: Unfortunately, it makes an impact, but it just ricochets off of its plated body armor, and then tumbles to the ground. You can go ahead and make your–

TRAVIS: Thing to pull it back. Strength. 18.

MATT: Okay, no problem. You pull it back with the chain and catch it mid-air. Ending your turn there?

TRAVIS: Keeping my rage.

MATT: Indeed. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: All right, so I rev up the Boots of Haste and I'm going to run right next to Vex'ahlia, on the very edge of the map. And the fire elemental there's right up against Percy, right?

MATT: Yep.

LIAM: All right. I'm going to stab him three times in his fire buttocks. First one is a 27.

MATT: That hits.

LIAM: Second one is a 16.

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: Third is a 14.

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: Hits, okay. So, first one's sneak attack, so, shite. An eight– I'll add that on at the end. Here come the dice. Two, four, seven, ten, 16, 21, 27, 28. 28 plus two is 30, 36, for that first with sneak attack damage.

MATT: Oof! His form flickers briefly for a moment from the sheer impact of the dagger hit.

LIAM: Second dagger does seven, and third swipe does nine.

MATT: Nine. All righty. The two other daggers impact, partially passing through its form, not quite as impactful as the first. That first one did seemingly cause the creature to have a hard time coalescing its fire-wreathed physicality. That ends your turn, Vax?

LIAM: Yes.

MATT: Gern, you're up. So you're right there.

CHRIS: I'm right there. How far can I run and cast a spell at the ones around Fatty?

MATT: 30 feet is how far you can run, and that's about six squares.

CHRIS: If I were to cast a bit of– how about a Cone of Cold, could I cast a Cone of Cold at the fire elementals?

MATT: You could, you could very much so.

LIAM: That sounds delightful.

CHRIS: I could cast Ice Storm, but that's a general malaise of middle-aged couples living in a neighborhood, becoming aware of their dead-end lives.

MATT: All right, so you want to move around here?

CHRIS: Yes, let's move around that bit right there. And I'd like to cast Cone of Cold. I might unfortunately have to take out Fatty, but–

MATT: Yeah, there's probably a good chance, this is not going to be– After everything else Fatty's survived, his own master deals him the possible finishing blow.

CHRIS: I feel like I should be the one to do it.

SAM: Of course.

CHRIS: It's much more humane.

SAM: It's poetic.

CHRIS: I think so.

MARISHA: You brought him into this world.

CHRIS: This is what Fatty would've wanted.

MATT: Everything under that area gets affected. So yeah, you could do that.

CHRIS: Yeah, don't worry about it. It's fine. No big thing. This old spell? I mean.

LIAM: Y'all want to go to the DQ and get a cone of cold?

MATT: What's your spell DC? It should be at the top of your spell page.

CHRIS: It is 16.

MATT: 16, all right. And it is a constitution save, let's see if they make it. That is a failure, a failure, and a failure.

SAM: What about Fatty, did he succeed?

MATT: Oh, I'll roll for Fatty. Fatty does not succeed. Nope.

LAURA: It was inevitable.

MATT: Nope. All right, go ahead and roll 8d8 points of cold damage.

SAM: Jeez. Oh man, these are not used a lot.

CHRIS: I have four. Let's see, I have a whole– there's another one here… They're not that easy to get to. Two, four, six. I need two more.

SAM: Two more? Good gravy.

CHRIS: Is this one?

SAM: Yep.

CHRIS: Here's one, and… D'oh!

LAURA: This is why I sort my dice at the beginning of the game…

CHRIS: Sorry, it sounded like there was something coming from the other side of the room.

SAM: Taliesin, you don't have a d8?

CHRIS: Do you have a d8 I can borrow?

TALIESIN: I actually don't. I don't know what happened to my d8's. I'll buy some at the convention tomorrow.

LAURA: Yay!

MATT: By the way, guys, if we hit 16k before the end of tonight's show, we're going to go ahead and have a sloth come into the studio.

LAURA: What?!

MATT and MARISHA: 16K and a sloth!

MARISHA: I know! I know!

LAURA: When? When?

TRAVIS: What?

SAM: An actual sloth?

LIAM: Is it going to play with us?

LAURA: Can we hold it?

TRAVIS: Focus, focus.

CHRIS: Seven, 14, 21, 27, 31, 34, 38, 44!

ALL: Oh!

MATT: 44, all…

LAURA: (mocking Gern's accent) Farty-far pints o' cald damage!

CHRIS: I don't think I appreciate that very fucking much! I'm saving all your fucking arses out here! For crumb's sake!

MATT: As he's shouting out at you, releasing this amazing, condensed blast of pure winter hell in front of him, it comes scattering across this way, freezing the corner of this, turning partially some of the lava here to stone just by proximity, blasts past these entities, and as the arcane snow comes to rest, you can see the fire elemental here itself is having a hard time keeping itself together. Its flame is (whoosh) sputtering and flickering, barely keeping itself together. However, by its side you see three very still frozen-solid statuettes of the remnants of the two salamanders and Fatty Arbuckle. Taken by the cold of winter.

MARISHA: Oh, shit. That was awesome.

SAM: Maybe you can reanimate him.

CHRIS: It's too late. He's no good any longer.

SAM: Freezer burn?

CHRIS: Move on. I have.

MATT: We'll say for the purposes of remembering that, too, put a couple of: frozen, frozen, and frozen.

CHRIS: (singing) Let it go, let it go.

MATT: All right. I believe that ends your turn, Gern? All right. It would be the salamanders' turn, but they're frozen. Damn, they got pummeled. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Awesome. Wait, so they can unfreeze? Or are they basically frozen until something–

MATT: You don't know.

LAURA: (groans) Okay. That yellow one behind me, that's Keyleth, right?

MATT: You believe so.

LAURA: Okay. I know, right? I'm going to flip backwards like ten feet.

MATT: All right, right behind it.

LAURA: I don't want to be around anybody else, so I'm going to flip over the lava pit and go out there.

MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

LIAM: Oh, don't burn your foot. Ooh!

LAURA: That would be 38.

MATT: Without issue, you land– not even, no. Two-point landing, on your feet, knee down, still clutching your ready-to-go bow, unscathed by the boiling cauldron of molten rock.

LAURA: And I Hunter's Mark the guy attacking near Percy and Scanlan and I shoot two arrows into him.

MATT: Okay, right there. Go for it. Two attacks.

LAURA: Ugh. Where is my thing? Hold on, sorry. (giggles)

MATT: You're on deck, Keyleth.

LAURA: 21?

MATT: 21 hits.

LAURA: And 17.

MATT: Both hit.

TRAVIS: That's nice.

LAURA: 17 on the first hit.

MATT: All right.

LAURA: And then 18 on the second hit.

MATT: Nice! Both arrows burn to ash when they impact, but the sheer blow and the magical energy behind it from the bow that you threw it from hit it and you can see it begin to shake its form even more, itself. Did you do the Hunter's Mark damage as well?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, good. Cool. That end your turn, Vex?

LAURA: Yes.

MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: Okay. Work with me here.

MATT: Okay. All right, whatcha got, whatcha got?

MARISHA: So here's what I want to do. I want to go low and dive into that lava pit in front of me.

SAM: Ooh! Sounds scary.

MARISHA: And I want to– using the lava around me to rise out of the lava and look really scary and badass, and then I'm going to shout to the living elementals, I'm going to be like, hear my warning! I am your new master! Retreat to the Fire Plane or meet your imminent demise! This is your last chance.

SAM: Pretty good. Pretty good.

TALIESIN: Way better than last time.

MARISHA: Thanks! Thanks, guys. And if you'd like to meet for coffee later I might be available.

MATT: I'll say, given the use of lava control in this, they are still elementals, go ahead and make a persuasion check. No, intimidate, this would be intimidate.

MARISHA: Okay. Okay. That's better than my persuasion. Let's do this one, that one rolled a one. Get out of here. Get out of here. 15?

MATT: 15? You can see the smaller elemental here that just watched its friends get frozen solid, as well as whatever that skeleton was, turns towards you, and (snarls) and begins to make its way this direction.

MARISHA: Away? That's cool.

TRAVIS: Towards the portal.

MATT: Yeah. The large one doesn't seem prominently fazed by your display.

MARISHA: Okay. But that one's peacing out? Do I still have an action?

MATT: I would say that whole thing of bringing up the molten rock and the shout and everything would be your action.

TALIESIN: You knocked one off the plank, Keyleth.

MARISHA: I knocked one off the plank.

MATT: There you go. All right, ends your turn, Keyleth, brings us to Percy.

TALIESIN: I'm toe to toe with that one right there, aren't I?

MATT: Yeah, it's right up in your space.

TALIESIN: It's in my space. Okay. I'm going to draw my sword, I'm going to try to do a back and forth. Let's see how this goes.

MATT: All right.

TALIESIN: I'm going to take a swipe at it with my sword.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: That's a 30. That hits.

MATT: That hits. You take nine points of fire damage, as just striking it, the flames burst back and burn towards your face and torso from the impact.

MARISHA: Did I put fire resist on you? At the end of last game?

TALIESIN: Yes, you did! I have fire resist on me.

MATT: Okay.

MARISHA: So you take half damage.

TALIESIN: So that's how much? How much fire damage?

MATT: That would be four. Four damage.

TALIESIN: Four damage? Four damage. Four.

MATT: All right. And roll damage for your strike.

TALIESIN: Ooh! 15 points of damage.

MATT: Hmm! All right. Do you want to make a second attack, you said? Or are you just going to keep going back and forth, what's your plan? Whatcha doing? Whatcha doing, Percy?

TALIESIN: He's being a dick. I'm going to try and break away and back up, I'm going to try and roll away from him to be on the other side of the rock.

MATT: Okay. As you roll away, it's going to take an attack of opportunity at you. That is an 18 to hit?

TALIESIN: My armor class is 18, but I'm going to use my shield for plus five to my AC, so that won't hit.

MATT: Okay, so you use your shield brooch, okay. As it strikes out towards you, streaking its elemental claws outward, you back away, instilling the power of the brooch, and you see an arcane shield temporarily ricochets, pushing its claw away from you. You run away unharmed to the other side of the rock.

TALIESIN: Instead of going to the other side of the rock, I'm going to run straight back, and I'm just going to shoot at it as I run away. I'm going to make two more shots at it.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to take one more shot, because I have to reload. That's a 15.

MATT: 15 hits.

TALIESIN: Wow! Holy cow.

MATT: Elementals aren't very hard to hit.

TALIESIN: No, that was amazing. That's ten points of damage. And then I reload.

MATT: All right, and you reload. All right, that ends Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: Who's behind me back there, way at the edge of the map?

MATT: Over there?

LAURA: That's Vax.

SAM: That's Vax? Oh, he'll be fine. Okay, I don't want to be near this thing, probably. Right?

MATT: That's your call.

SAM: Okay, I'm going to take a step towards Vax.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: And away from Gern, right? So is Gern 15 feet away from me yet, so far?

MATT: He's 15 feet from you, yeah.

SAM: Okay. So I will then cast Thunderwave, which should not hit Gern, but will hit Vax.

MATT: Is that a 15-foot radius?

SAM: It's a 15-foot cube.

MATT: Cube, so you can just make the cube here, and it'll hit none of them.

SAM: Oh! Oh, great. I'll do that. And I'll do it at level two. Thunderwave.

MATT: All right, level two Thunderwave. Coming on up. Oh, it's a self. A 15-foot cube originating from you, so yeah, so you can hit that guy.

SAM: Yeah, originating from me.

MATT: All right, cool. So, level three, that's 3d8, let's see if it makes its constitution saving throw. It does not, not with a natural seven. So go ahead and roll your damage, 3d8 thunder damage.

SAM: Not very much – Ooh! That's pretty good. 20.

MARISHA: Nice!

MATT: 20! How do you want to do this?

(cheering)

TRAVIS: Scanlan Shorthalt!

SAM: I send the Thunderwave out by cracking my knuckles, and as I do so, I do: ahem, Gern, might want to check this out.

CHRIS: Oh, I'm looking at something over here.

SAM: Gern!

CHRIS: I'll be with you in just a minute, I'm dealing with something.

SAM: Gern, I'm doing something really cool here.

CHRIS: I'll be with you in just a minute.

SAM: Fuck. So I do it anyway but with a scowl on my face.

CHRIS: All right, what did I miss?

SAM: Fuck!

CHRIS: Oh, I was just, why didn't you wait? I just said a minute.

SAM: Oh, forget it, you had to be there.

CHRIS: All right. I was here, but you didn't– you should've told me.

MATT: You even missed your own Thunderwave spell, you were so distracted with your frustration. You look back, you cracked your knuckles, and it's gone, but you didn't see it happen and it's a little disappointing overall.

SAM: I kick the dirt.

MATT: All right. You guys look over as this elemental runs off towards the glowing doorway you see further down this passage. It's not that far away from you, but you do see the flickering doorway that's like (sputtering). You can see other entities beginning to step out of it, and you can see one larger form. It looks fiery, humanoid, just (crackling) comes out, lower body made of ash and cinders.

MARISHA: I rush that way and look for my other tribe. Can I see any of my other tribemates?

MATT: Make a perception check.

LIAM: You're running at them.

TRAVIS: So if they're frozen, does that mean they're dead?

MATT: You can go find out.

LAURA: They'll probably melt eventually.

TRAVIS: Yeah, can I walk over there close to them?

MARISHA: That's better. That one keeps fucking me. What'd you say? Perception?

MATT: Yes.

MARISHA: 26.

MATT: 26. Currently, from where you stand–

MARISHA: No, sorry, sorry. 24.

MATT: 24. From where you stand, you can look off in the distance, you can see parts of the treeline across, down the Cindergrove, shifting and moving, and you hear the distant sounds of combat, but you do not have a visual perspective. It looks like the other teams have not quite made their way to the center. You're actually the first team to get here. And you made your way around a possible encounter, and in doing so, arrived before the other teams did. However, it looks like a secondary line of defense is now pouring out of this doorway.

LAURA: Oh shit.

TRAVIS: Can I make my way to the two frozen statue-types?

MATT: There's three statues, actually.

TRAVIS: Or three of 'em, yeah.

MATT: Including Fatty Arbuckle.

TRAVIS: Fatty Arbuckle. Can I make my way over to one of them and– should I just make sure they're dead?

LAURA: Yeah, just push 'em over, smash them.

TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, can I push Trident-dick over?

MATT: Yeah. As you shove– and it's a pretty heavy form, especially with the ice that's, you know, formed around the body–

TRAVIS: Come on.

MATT: –but not too hard for you, Grog, because you're Grog. You give a little shove, and as it topples over, it just shatters into 100 pieces.

TRAVIS: Ooh, like the T-1000.

LIAM: What?

TRAVIS: Yeah, I dunno.

LAURA: Do the other one now.

TRAVIS: Oh yeah, can I go over and do the other one, like, (giggles).

MATT: Yeah. This time, you give this one a full push, this one actually gets about ten feet in the air.

MARISHA: Cow-tipper!

MATT: Before scattering across the ground, pieces of it actually spilling into the molten lava. And there stands, frozen in place, Fatty Arbuckle, chest destroyed, arm limp to the side, just–

TRAVIS: Can I pick him up and walk him back over to Gern and go: sorry.

MATT: You see the half-giant goliath handing you the frozen body of your skeletal friend.

CHRIS: Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this, now.

TRAVIS: You don't want him?

CHRIS: I mean, he's not very– maybe we could have a quick burial.

LAURA: You could hang a coat on him.

CHRIS: So we basically would just carry him around as a coat-rack.

LIAM: Don't we have company incoming?

LAURA: We have a Bag of Holding. Oh, there's a giant monster. I Hunter's Mark it. Is it close by?

MATT: We'll get to that as soon as we come back from this break. We're going to take a quick bathroom break and we'll see you guys back here in about ten minutes or so to continue this next step in the adventure.
Break

Part II

MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role. Last we left off, the party was making their way towards the center of the caldera where the portal torn open to the fire elemental plane resides over a flow of molten rock pouring in three directions from the center of the mountain. Seeing a number of entities swirling around, and some pouring forth from this open doorway, Vox Machina and their current temporary ally by the traveling dragonborn wizard/necromancer/candlemaker named Gern Blanston have made their way in this direction. Now, before we start, just to remind you guys, I guess we're getting pretty close to 16k subscribers, and when we hit 16k something with a sloth is going to happen.

LAURA: Not tonight, though.

MATT: No, not, I don't think tonight.

SAM: We have a sloth on standby.

MATT: There will be a sloth apparently that will come here for 16k and a sloth. And if you want to watch Laura freak out–

LAURA: Ah, so much!

MATT: Also, we have a giveaway winner for the evening; ToastKingJr is the winner of tonight's Critical Role giveaway, congratulations. Well done, you, we'll be sending you a lot of fun goodies your way very shortly, so–

CHRIS: Our regards to ToastKing senior.

MATT: Oh yes; well, you've made him proud. Make sure to let him know. We'll give him a little a little pipe or something inside too, it'll be good. All right, so you guys gather yourselves, stepping through the battlefield you had just encountered, the shattered and slowly melting pieces of ice that once were some of these fire elemental denizens scattered around your feet, you step forward as you see the somewhat human, somewhat flame-based entity come pouring out of the void, surrounded by other elementals, and one of the other standing salamander general-type individuals. You can see–

MARISHA: This is coming out of the rift?

MATT: Yes, coming out of the rift.

LAURA: Is that behind him, is that what the–

MATT: This is the actual doorway right there.

MARISHA: Oh, and so this is a pool of lava that they're coming out of?

MATT: Yes, this is all molten–

MARISHA: Molten fire plane, more or less?

MATT: Well, this is actual lava from the inside of the mountain that has been called forth and cracked through the surface, because of the presence of the tear.

LAURA: Oh my gosh.

CHRIS: Probably fine.

TRAVIS: Probably. I don't think this will be bad

TALIESIN: We did not take a short rest, did we?

MATT: No, you did not.

TALIESIN: There has been no time.

MARISHA: I'm going to, and upon seeing this, drop my fire elemental form and I say: oh shit, I have a feeling this is the 'him' they were talking about. And I have a feeling he's not going to believe that I'm the real new master. So there's that.

LAURA: So do some cold stuff, like this guy.

MATT: I'd like you all to make a stealth check, by the way, as this is transpiring, and these entities are now making–

LAURA: Pass Without a Trace? Is that still in effect?

MATT: No, you cast Hunter's Mark, so the concentration on that ended, unfortunately, sorry.

CHRIS: 14.

SAM: 15.

TALIESIN: 13.

SAM: Oh wait, with Pass Without a Trace?

MARISHA and LAURA: No.

MARISHA: 24.

LIAM: 34.

LAURA: 22.

TRAVIS: 20.

MATT: As you guys are all having this conversation, hushed behind this barricade of broken tree elements, you can see this salamander general turn and hiss in that direction, look over, and point his trident in the direction of where you all are. You can see the larger fire elementals all of a sudden turn their attention in the direction of the party, as the humanoid floating about five feet off the ground, his lower form just this swirl of cinders and black ash, chuckles with his arms crossed. Points forward, and the elementals begin moving forward.

MARISHA: Can Keyleth do a quick ancillary action before shit happens?

MATT: Well, this would be the initiative order now, so everyone roll initiative.

LIAM: Maybe they see something behind us.

TRAVIS: Fuck!

MARISHA: Jesus, sucking it up today.

MATT: All right, folks, this brings us to 25 to 20?

LIAM: 20.

SAM: Hey!

TRAVIS: Jude.

CHRIS: Don't make it bad.

TALIESIN: (singing) Take a bad roll…

MATT: 20 to 15?

LAURA: 19.

CHRIS: Yes, I'm 16.

MATT: 16 for Gern.

LIAM: ErmahGern!

MATT: 15 to ten?

TALIESIN: 13.

MATT: 13 for Percy. Ten to five?

TRAVIS: Eight.

MATT: Eight for Grog. Scanlan, what's your–

SAM: Oh, ten, sorry, ten, ten.

MATT: So that would be just below you, Percy. All righty. I believe that's all on that end there. And that brings us to–

MARISHA: I'm seven, by the way.

MATT: Oh, seven, thought I got you.

LAURA: Nobody cares, Marisha.

MARISHA: I know, I'll just… be back here… caboose.

MATT: There we go. So right before Grog is Keyleth. Great. All right. Top of the combat round.

MARISHA: Yeah, nope. Not leading.

MATT: All right.

MARISHA: Shitty initiative roll.

SAM: It's going to be fine.

TALIESIN: He's cut things out of cardboard. This doesn't look fun.

MARISHA: There was planning. There was a thought process.

TRAVIS: Oh shit, towers.

TALIESIN: There was an instructables involved in this. This is just really– we're doomed.

TRAVIS: No, no, he was down in the play zone before!

MATT: Tell me who wants to roll an arcana check as you see this entity rising up–

TRAVIS: Oh, absolutely.

SAM: I will, as well.

MATT: For people who are proficient with it.

TRAVIS: Two.

SAM: Oh, with disadvantage, right?

MATT: Yes, you do.

LIAM: So tired.

CHRIS: 24.

TRAVIS: Whoa! Get out of here, dragonborn!

SAM: Look at the big brain on Gern.

CHRIS: I'm very smart.

MATT: (laughs) And as you say that, you recognize this entity and blurt out its name, just instinctually as you get a proper view of it. One of the many denizens of the fire elemental plane, this is an efreeti, it is a fire genie.

SAM: A nefreeti?

MATT: Efreeti. Yes, the species is efreeti, but an ee-frit, ee-freet, however you want to pronounce it, a flame genie, generally hailing from the City of Brass and/or spaces around and in the fire elemental plane.

TALIESIN: I could feel it from that side.

LIAM: I was thinking it.

TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I could feel it.

MATT: Floats above all of you, arms still crossed, opens its arms and as it chuckles, both hands just are engulfed in flames that congeal into these large fiery balls as it flings them both down in the direction of the party.

TRAVIS: Feel like we're in MegaMan. A MegaMan boss.

MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah!

MATT: This is going to be at Scanlan and Vex.

LAURA: What?!

SAM: These are Fireballs, right?

MATT: To Scanlan, that is 13?

SAM: No way.

MATT: Vex, that is 15.

LAURA: No!

MATT: Both just (fireball impacts), cracking into the ground to the sides of where you're standing, barely missing them. It keeps glaring down at the rest of you with a smile. Ending that, it brings us to Vax. You're up.

LIAM: I got a high stealth right beforehand, so am I hidden at the moment?

MATT: As far as you know, depending on the individual. You don't know who saw you and who didn't.

LIAM: As far as I know. All right. Balls. I'm just going to throw three daggers at the salamander, right from where I am.

MATT: Right from where you are? All right.

LIAM: Yeah, okay, so. First is a 20, second is a 14, third is a 19.

MATT: Okay. The first one was what?

LIAM: 20.

MATT: The first and the third hit. If you are hidden, though, which you would technically be hidden from this individual, you do have advantage on those attacks, so you can reroll the–

LIAM: And if I'm hidden it's a surprise, right? On that guy? You tell me.

MATT: No, no, it's a sneak attack if you're hidden. A surprise round is if they have no idea that you're there.

LIAM: Okay, I thought it was a– okay, great! Fine. Love it. Okay, so.

LAURA: You have advantage, so maybe one of those would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their advantages.

LIAM: All right. No, and other one, no. So, four, eight, 12, 13, 16, 20, 31, 35 for the first. And the second one is a ten.

TRAVIS: Kick us off strong!

MATT: Not bad! Flinging both daggers, one strikes it square in the sternum and the blade cracks and pops as it hits the center of the chest. It (gurgle), you know, it can't make any sound as it disappears from the wound, returning to your belt. The second dagger manages to come towards, it tries to parry out of the air, but in doing so just gets it embedded in its forearm and it shrieks out in pain, as that too vanishes and appears once again in your belt. Are you going to move, or stay where you are?

LIAM: I'm going to move. I'm going to skip to my right and stand behind Grog and spank him on the ass and say: go get 'em, tiger.

MATT: “Go get 'em, tiger.” Right there. All righty.

TRAVIS: My name's Grog.

MATT: Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Are those trees, do they have any substance at all, or are they just there to look pretty?

MATT: I mean, you could get behind them if you want to, they're maybe about that wide.

LIAM: They're like Charlie Brown Christmas trees?

MATT: Practically. As far as the Cindergrove's concerned, they're pretty sad-looking. A lot of them have been destroyed and torn and pushed down around.

LAURA: All right. I'm going to try to use one as protection. I'm going to hop behind the one over this way.

MATT: This way, here?

LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark the efreeti.

MATT: All righty. Mark the efreeti.

LAURA: And then I'm going to use my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. And I'm going to shoot him three times!

MATT: Go for it.

LAURA: That first one probably does not succeed. It is a 16.

MATT: That does not hit, nope.

LAURA: What about 23?

MATT: That does hit.

LAURA: All right. How about… mega miss. So one of those hits, because I'm a loser.

MATT: Streaking past, and the third one hits as he's holding the flame balls in his hands. Seeing the small impact, he just glares at you though the impact.

TRAVIS: You need to sacrifice a small mammal. Maybe we can find a squirrel or something.

LAURA: 11.

TRAVIS: A pagan ritual.

TALIESIN: I can hook you up. I have a kit.

TRAVIS: (laughter) Why am I not surprised?

LAURA: 17 points of damage and that's it because I suck.

MATT: 17 points of damage. And you are hiding behind the tree?

LAURA: I am hiding behind the tree.

MATT: That's the end of Vex's turn. It is now the elementals' turns.

LAURA: These piece-of-shit dice.

MATT: This is going to move in and actually consumes the space of Gern and his followers.

TALIESIN: That's not even a figurine, it's just a chunk of plastic.

MATT: So as you're sitting there, you just see this fire elemental just streak around real fast and all of a sudden step into the space where you and your two undead followers are, flames whirling around you. All of you immediately take five points of fire damage, you and your two allies. Stimpy and Coral, poor guys.

CHRIS: Weren't there– oh, they killed one, that's right, and you guys fucking killed one, too.

MATT: With that, it's going to make two strikes towards you, Gern. The fire elemental rushes in and just (slithering fire noises).

CHRIS: Not the vest, not the vest!

MATT: That is going to be a 13 to hit. What's your armor class?

CHRIS: 13.

MATT: Just hits you. And that's a natural 20.

(sighs and groans)

MATT: So you take 14 points of fire damage from the first one.

CHRIS: Doesn't feel very natural.

LIAM: Thanks for coming, thanks for playing.

MATT: 19 points of fire damage from the second strike. And you are currently engulfed in flame. You caught fire from the impact with the fire elemental.

CHRIS: It doesn't hurt, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm part dragon.

LAURA: Do dragonborn have natural fire resistance?

MATT: Certain ones do, not blue ones.

LAURA: Oh no!

CHRIS: If it was lightning, it'd be fine. But no.

MATT: That ends that elemental's turn. This one is going to step into the space where both Percy and Scanlan are. Both of you guys immediately suffer seven points of fire damage.

TALIESIN: I'm halved because I have resistance.

MATT: Correct, so you'd take three points. And it's going to make a strike on each of you. That's going to be a 14 versus you, Scanlan.

SAM: That does not hit me.

MATT: And then versus Percy. Same roll. 14.

TALIESIN: (laughter) Ah, you're adorable.

MATT: Misses you both with a series of terrible attacks. That ends their turn. Gern, you're up. At the start of your turn–

CHRIS: It's my turn.

TALIESIN: But first you have to take your fire damage.

CHRIS: Oh, I'm still on fire.

MATT: Yep. At the top of your turn, because you're now on fire, you take six points of fire damage. You're just wreathed in fire, all around. It's a bad, bad Sunday for Gern.

CHRIS: Oh boy. I'm trying to find something that won't destroy– How close is everyone to me? Everyone's pretty close.

SAM: No one's near the big guy.

CHRIS: No, but I'm standing right there.

TALIESIN: Here, you can see it right here. You're that little red ring right there, and then your two followers are right there. If you have anything that goes in a cube, you'd be fine. Do you have anything that's a cube shot?

CHRIS: And which way am I facing?

TALIESIN: Whichever way you want to be facing.

CHRIS: I mean, I guess– I'd like to run around and throw another Cone of Cold aimed at that guy, and then up at the prick hovering above everyone.

MATT: This direction, you mean?

CHRIS: Yes. Aye!

MATT: So you can move around to this side of the elemental, pushing past your allies, whip around, you get a little bit of a view through the fire and flames swirling around you. You concentrate and release a burst of cold energy. It might not be close enough.

CHRIS: Of course it is!

MATT: It'll be enough to get those two there.

CHRIS: All right, well, I suppose that's better than nothing at all.

SAM: That's impressive.

MATT: It's better than nothing. All right, so constitution saves on the elemental. What's your DC?

CHRIS: 16.

MATT: 16. It fails. On the salamander, that's another big fail with a 13. So go ahead and roll 8d8 damage.

CHRIS: (counting) 40. I'm sorry. What was that last one? Shit. 35.

MATT: Nice, 35 points of cold damage to both the salamander and the elemental in front of you. Great. So you see as a blast of winter arcane energy just skirts forward, casting most of the dark area here in snow and ice and sleet. You can see the front of this lava pond is cooled for the moment and actually can be walked across probably for one or two more rounds.

CHRIS: You're welcome.

LIAM: You're still on fire, by the way.

MATT: Yes, you are also still on fire. Someone has to take an action to try and douse the flames on him, whether it be himself or possibly your allies. You can still give actions to your two undead buddies.

CHRIS: Oh. In that case. I think I'd like to ask the zombie character, who I believe was– no, Stimpy was the skeleton, this is Coral. I'd like to have Coral rip– is my skin on fire, or is it just my vest?

MATT: Both, actually. The scales are starting to crisp.

CHRIS: Those are really hard to get!

SAM: The vest?

CHRIS: Yes!

TALIESIN: You could just have them swat you. Like (zombie grunting noises).

CHRIS: I need to have the zombie hurl its body on top of me, onto the ground, and roll around on me, to get the flame off. It's a very stinky enterprise.

MATT: Okay, I'll allow this. You're intentionally going prone, so you start your next combat round on the ground, which means you'll have half your movement. As Stimpy hobbles over (zombie groan).

SAM: This is Coral.

CHRIS: Is there like snow or ice on the ground?

MATT: There is behind the elemental, yes.

CHRIS: Can he scoop some up?

MATT: The zombie can take one action, unfortunately, it's not a super intelligent creature. One or the other.

CHRIS: All right, then, I suppose he just has to roll on top of me.

MATT: You guys glance over out of the corner of your eye and you see is the dragonborn all of a sudden jumps to the ground, sprawled out, snow angel style.

CHRIS: Do it! Just do it already! What are you waiting for?!

MATT: As this undead begins flailing about on top of his body. You're starting to get elements of decaying goo and–

CHRIS: Yes, it's fucking terrible!

MATT: But the flames do eventually go out, over the next five to six seconds or so. What would you like Stimpy to do?

CHRIS: I mean, I guess– I would have to give him a candle, wouldn't I?

MATT: You would, yes.

CHRIS: Right. Maybe he just scoops up as much ice and snow as possible, and attacks the–

MATT: Sure.

SAM: Snowball fight?

CHRIS: Snowball fight.

MATT: He picks up some of the frost on the ground with his skeletal hands. Flings it. Funnily enough, it hits.

CHRIS: Fuck yeah, it does.

MATT: Because it's right there. We'll say for that particular instance, it takes–

CHRIS: What, like a hundred points of damage?

MATT: Three points of cold damage.

(cheers)

MATT: Immediate steam, in the face of a fire elemental.

CHRIS: I smell like cooked cow anus at the moment.

MATT: Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: Weird question, what saving throw does a creature have to make with your sword?

TRAVIS: Wisdom.

TALIESIN: It's a wisdom saving throw?

MATT: No, it's constitution.

TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. Good to know.

TRAVIS: I just answered the first thing that popped into my head.

TALIESIN: That was wisdom, fascinating. Okay, I'm right in the thick of it, aren't it?

MATT: Yes.

TALIESIN: I'm going to break away, I'll take the hit. I don't like attacking these things straight on.

MATT: At the top of your turn, by the way, you take nine points of fire damage, down to four, because you are also engulfed in flame, as is Scanlan for having passed over the space there.

TALIESIN: Nine points of fire damage, down to four. Okay. I'm going to break away and take a run for it towards that crater in the far right corner.

MATT: This way here?

TALIESIN: Thank you, yes.

MATT: Running past the fire elemental, it does get an attack of opportunity on you, swinging out with its flaming appendage. That is going to be a 13 to hit.

TALIESIN: That ain't going to hit. That's fine, I'm going to take my bonus action, and I'm going to cast Hex on it.

MATT: On which one?

TALIESIN: On the one I just ran away from.

MATT: Okay, that elemental is now currently Hexed.

TALIESIN: With a disadvantage on constitution saving throws.

MATT: Oh, okay!

TRAVIS: Hey!

TALIESIN: Teamwork!

TRAVIS: I don't think he has any blood, though.

MATT: Is it saving throws, or is it ability checks?

TALIESIN: Ability checks.

MATT: That does not affect saving throws, unfortunately.

TALIESIN: God damn it. All right, never mind. That's fine. Since I've broken off from him, I'm going to take some shots at him anyway. I'll take three shots.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: First one is an 18.

MATT: 18 hits.

TALIESIN: That's seven points of damage. Second one's a sharpshooter. That's 25.

MATT: 25. And with that shot (boom).

(cheering)

TRAVIS: Jeez, leave some for the rest of us, big boy.

MARISHA: Oh, wait, why did it go back?

MATT: Sorry, this is the one that took all the damage from the Cone of Cold, so this one is still fine. Robbed you of victory!

CHRIS: That was so weird, he disappeared for a moment and then came right back!

TALIESIN: I haven't actually damaged him yet, have I?

MATT: You did seven damage.

TALIESIN: That was the first damage. The second damage I haven't done yet.

MATT: No, you have not.

TALIESIN: 20 points of damage.

MATT: All right, nice. You're adding your Hexes to this, right?

TALIESIN: No, I'm not! Oh, shit.

MATT: Add d6 to each of these, buddy.

TALIESIN: So that's six extra points, and that's seven extra points total. Third sharpshooter shot. Thank you for reminding me on the Hex. That's a 12, that's going to miss.

MATT: 12 misses, unfortunately. You shoot too far. It actually separates its body for a second, the flames flickering away from the impact of the bullet, passing through, no effect, unfortunately.

TALIESIN: Weird thing. Can I spend an action surge and put myself out of the fire?

MATT: You can.

TALIESIN: You know what, it's just fire. I will be on fire.

MATT: You will be on fire, Percy.

TALIESIN: I'm going to be on fire.

MARISHA: It's just fire.

MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: What is holding the thing that's floating in the sky aloft? Is he flying? Is he supported on a column of fire?

CHRIS: No, he's brought a plastic shelf with himself, apparently.

SAM: Oh, of course.

CHRIS: He's just standing on it.

MATT: It's Ikea-made, you just have to build it.

TRAVIS: It's the “schlogel.”

MATT: It appears to be flying. The very essence of this creature is partial flame and magic, and it's levitating as its lower form is a tiny dervish whirlwind of black ash and flame.

SAM: And he's a larger creature or smaller?

MATT: Large.

SAM: He's a large creature or smaller. Okay. I'm going to make him the boy in the bubble. I will cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

TALIESIN: Yay!

MARISHA: What is that?

SAM: I'm going to make a bubble around him.

MATT: First you take four points of fire damage, because you're on fire.

SAM: Oh, sure, whatever. No, wait, but it was nine, right? You said? Just four?

MATT: That was when it originally got to you, and then you're still burning every turn until you put yourself out. The range on the resilient sphere is 30 feet, so you're going to want to get closer to cast it.

SAM: Oh, okay. I'll walk. He's going to hit me, isn't he?

MATT: This is cool, currently, if you want to go across. You can get there, and that'll be enough distance.

SAM: I'll do that, and then straight up in the air.

MATT: Okay, so it has to make a dexterity saving throw. What's the DC? The DC on your spells is a 20 right now, right?

SAM: It is.

TALIESIN: Wow.

MATT: And it rolled a 19. 18 plus one.

LAURA: Oh my gosh!

MATT: And, with that, suddenly you guys see Scanlan concentrate, shouting the magical incantation through the hand cone–

SAM: You're in a ball, motherfucker!

MATT: You see a pink-purple-hued globe of crystalline, magical arcane energy just form around the creature, and the efreet goes (grunting).

SAM: Does he fall, or can he continue to fly?

MATT: The sphere is weightless, so no, he stays where he is.

LIAM: And is it a good witch, or a bad witch?

TALIESIN: Science check. Does oxygen penetrate the sphere?

SAM: There is still air inside.

TALIESIN: Damn it. Because that would've been amazing if he just died.

CHRIS: I was looking away, what just happened?

SAM: Oh, fuck!

CHRIS: What?

SAM: Always look at me!

CHRIS: Oh, I was looking at some grubs over by the–

TRAVIS: Grubs?

CHRIS: I'm hungry.

SAM: Oh, and I'll turn around and I will heal Gern, because he's not doing great. With my bonus action, at a second level, I will cast Healing Word, and I will sing to him again, because he loves it so much.

CHRIS: You know, I think I'm fine with 26 hit points.

SAM: (singing) Gern, baby, Gern! Candle inferno! Gern, baby, Gern! Burn that mother down!

MATT: All right. Second level, that's 2d4 plus–

SAM: Five.

MATT: 2d4 plus five you heal.

CHRIS: Oh, do I roll that?

SAM: Do I roll, or does he?

MATT: Whichever one. Doesn't matter to me.

CHRIS: Okay, so nine.

MATT: All right. Scanlan, I believe that ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

CHRIS: Thank you. I will never again not watch your spellcasting! You tiny bundle of adorable creature!

MARISHA: Is that guy and that guy within 30 feet of each other? It's hard to tell with the thing on it.

MATT: There is 30 feet between them, yes.

MARISHA: A 30 foot long spell could hit both of them, correct?

MATT: A 30 foot long spell could– It could only hit one. It's 30 feet between them.

MARISHA: Okay. But this guy– oh, damn it. What about this guy and this guy? They're within 30 feet, right?

MATT: 35 between them. These two, there is definitely.

MARISHA: Actually, yeah, let me do that. I am going to cast a Tidal Wave right here and I'm going to go outward in this direction, and it's ten foot wide and 30 foot long, so let me back up a little bit out of it.

MATT: So it's ten feet wide, and it'll go (rushing water) like that, you mean?

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: Okay, so you back up to there?

MARISHA: Yes.

MATT: All right. Okay, dexterity save on each of them. Dexterity save on the first one.

MARISHA: Since it's water, do they have disadvantage?

MATT: No, not for the saving throw. The first one does make the saving throw, however, that is a 19 plus three, so 22. On a success, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone, so it takes half. The other one, however, does fail.

MARISHA: Do they take more damage because it's water?

MATT: How much is in the spell?

MARISHA: It does 4d8 damage.

MATT: Right, go ahead and roll that. I'd say, how many gallons would that be? That's a shit-ton of gallons.

MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 12 plus eight is 20, plus another eight is 28. Math.

TALIESIN: That's a d8 there.

MATT: 14. Okay, so that's 14 and 28. I'd say that Tidal Wave, how many gallons of water would we say each one of those is?

MARISHA: It's 30 foot tall.

MATT: Well, it's ten foot tall, ten foot wide, so that's…

MARISHA: And 30 feet long.

TALIESIN: Four gallons, easily.

MATT: I'd say we're looking at close to 50 gallons of water, right?

TALIESIN: Probably way more than 50 gallons.

LAURA: That's a lot of gallons, for sure.

CHRIS: I think it's like a million gallons.

SAM: Somewhere between 50 and a million.

MARISHA: Why didn't we switch to metric?

TALIESIN: It would be a few hundred gallons of water.

MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, for the width of it and the space you had to pass it through, we'll say roughly 60 gallons of water passes through each of these elementals. Water susceptibility, for every five feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes one point of cold damage, so they both take an additional 60 points of damage. Which destroys both of the elementals.

LAURA: Fuck yeah! Do that again, Keyleth!

MARISHA: Okay, I will!

TALIESIN: Again, again!

MATT: So Keyleth, you have more movement still, if you want to move somewhere.

MARISHA: Oh! I'll scootch up a bit, start moving towards…

MATT: There?

MARISHA: That's good, that works.

MATT: Okay. That brings us to Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: I would like to rush up where Scanlan is, and attack that little guy on the ground there.

MATT: Right there?

SAM: I'm the little guy on the ground.

TRAVIS: No, not you, the other guy that's next to him. And can I use a reckless attack–

MATT: Are you raging first, or are you–

TRAVIS: Oh yeah, raging. I would like to rage. And then use reckless attack against him!

MATT: All right, so you got two attacks, reckless attack.

TRAVIS: 24?

MATT: 24 hits.

TRAVIS: 23.

MATT: 23 hits.

TRAVIS: Awesome. 18 on the first one.

MATT: Nice.

TRAVIS: And 23.

MATT: 23, nice. All right, so as you rush past, looking over at the cooled rock that's starting to crack, and bits of steam vents are starting to push through underneath your feet, Scanlan. The area you're standing on isn't very sturdy, you're probably going to want to move pretty soon. However, you see this barreling form of pure anger and blade come rushing past as Grog slams into the salamander twice with his blade. That fails first constitution, and fails second. So you gain plus two strength, salamander loses two strength.

TRAVIS: Yes.

MATT: However, because you've taken… With each strike within melee of the salamander's heated body, it's so intense by its proximity that you suffer six points of fire damage from the first melee attack against you.

TRAVIS: She gave me resistance, so halved to three?

MATT: Halved to two.

TRAVIS: Halved to two.

MATT: The other one would be 12, so you take six.

TRAVIS: Eight total.

MATT: Total of eight fire damage just from slamming and attacking this salamander. All righty, that brings us to the very end. It is now the salamander's turn. After being hacked twice by you, Grog, it turns around, takes its trident in both hands, looks at you with this horrible snarl. You can see now these glistening, almost ruby-like sharp teeth in its wide grin. (snarl) These long catfish-like tendrils that waft off its face as it slams down the spear towards you.

TRAVIS: Oh, you brought a fork to a sword fight.

MATT: That is going to be a 23 to hit.

TRAVIS: Oh shit, that hits.

MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage.

TRAVIS: Halved.

MATT: Halved to six. And it's going to also turn around and its tail, its long snake tail (whoosh) whips you. That is going to be an 18 to hit.

TRAVIS: That misses!

MATT: It misses, all righty. The tail comes towards you, and you knock it out of the way with Craven Edge. That will end its turn. Top of the round, I'm going to make a roll for the consistency of the currently cooled lava pool. It maintains. However, you feel your feet cracking beneath–

SAM: I think I'll stay.

TRAVIS: Feels nice here. Maybe a timeshare.

MATT: This efreet– let me look at the logistics of this spell now, because–

TRAVIS: It's pissed off in a ball.

TALIESIN: Oh yeah, this spell is awful.

SAM: It can't do anything.

MATT: It is enclosed for the duration, up to a minute.

LIAM: Sorry, Matt. Sorry, Matt.

TRAVIS: He's like, first the beholder, now my flame genie.

MATT: It's pushing against, and it takes these two flame balls it conjures and throws them out towards you guys. They just go (impacts) against the sphere and then go out, and it's just (growling). It's really, really pissed off. It can't do anything.

CHRIS: (singing) Like a genie in a bottle. Got to rub me the right way.

LIAM: Can we all collectively look up at him, look sad, and go, aw.

TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to rolling it back through the rift.

MARISHA: Oh my god, can we do that? Like a hamster ball.

MATT: All right. Ending its turn, because it can't do anything, Vax, you're up.

LIAM: All right, I'm going to scoot up right in front of Keyleth on the edge of the frozen-over pool of lava, but I'm not going to stand on it. And I'm going to chuck three daggers at the salamander in front of Grog.

MATT: Okay. Right there, about?

LIAM: Right in front of her. Between her and the– yeah. There. One, two, three to the salamander.

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: 21. Then 25. And then 21.

MATT: Okay, all three hit.

LIAM: All right, and because he's flanked by Grog, the first one gets sneak attack damage. Two plus eight, 14, 16, 17, 22, 23, 25, 31 for the first.

MATT: Nice.

LIAM: And then ten for the second and eight for the third.

MATT: All right. Good to know. (whoosh) As you jump in front of the way of Keyleth, you unleash all three daggers in rapid succession, each one finding its mark (impacts) into the body of the now profusely bleeding salamander. You can see now streaks of its own blood are pouring down, boiling on contact with air, the significant difference in temperature from the exterior and its actual interior body causing it to change from a liquid to a gas.

TRAVIS: That's our rogue.

MATT: End your turn?

LIAM: I look over my shoulder at Keyleth like a dumb schmuck for a second, and then back at the salamander.

MATT: Okay. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Okay. Am I hiding? Am I hidden?

MATT: You can roll a stealth check. A hide action is a hide action. As a rogue, do you have the–

LAURA: What is that number?

MATT: I don't know what number that is.

LAURA: It's completely smooshed off of the dice!

LIAM: That means that existence is about to end.

LAURA: There's literally–

LIAM: Just roll this. Roll another one.

MATT: Technically, you do not have cunning action yet, that's a 2nd-level rogue ability, so you would use your action to hide.

LAURA: But I had my skirmisher stealth.

MATT: If you go from hide to hide you can do that, but you are not hidden at the beginning of the round.

LIAM: It's a rookie rogue mistake. It happens in the beginning.

LAURA: Yeah. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. All right, then I'm just going to…

LIAM: At the higher levels you mess up the assassinate thing.

LAURA: Everything's a concentration thing, so I'm just going to lightning arrow the giant fire guy.

MATT: Right there?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack.

LAURA: Okay. 30!

MATT: That'll hit.

SAM: That'll hit anything.

LIAM: She just hit a sparrow on a paraglider.

LAURA: That's 4d8 lightning damage on a hit.

MATT: Correct, yep.

LIAM: Oh. Well, half good, half bad.

LAURA: 18. That's it.

MATT: 18 points of lightning damage?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: All right. So as you turn around the side of the tree, releasing the arrow. As it goes through the air, streaking, it suddenly bursts into an arcing bit of energy (crackling energy), a bolt of lightning that strikes into and begins to spill around the insides of the elemental. You can see it shakes it off as the energy disperses.

LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use my bonus action to hide then, with the skirmisher's thing. For my skirmisher stealth, I can use a bonus action to hide.

MATT: I'm pretty sure you have to… If you go from hiding to hiding, you can do it.

LAURA: You told me, I swear!

MATT: Read the ability, read the ability!

LAURA: Okay, where was it?

LIAM: Right now, on the air.

LAURA: Okay, where is it? I don't know where it is. I'll find it, and then I'll find out. And then I'll roll for stealth then if it works.

MATT: I'll say for the sake right now of the distraction, go ahead and do it for now, and we'll correct it later if need be. I would rather you have fun than not. So, what's your stealth roll?

LAURA: My stealth roll is 15, it doesn't even matter.

LIAM: 15, she said 15.

LAURA: It's not in the book, it's in the–

MATT: No, it's in the PDF. Anyway, what did you roll?

LAURA: 15.

MATT: 15, okay. Good to know. End of your turn. This elemental creature–

LIAM: Oh jeez. Here it comes.

MATT: Comes up over–

(yelling)

LIAM: Oh, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

MARISHA: He tripped at the finish line!

MATT: As another one tears out of the portal and begins making its way here at full movement to there. This one's going to go ahead and make two strikes towards you, Scanlan.

SAM: Two attacks towards me?

MATT: Yep. That's going to be 11.

SAM: Is that the attack roll?

MATT: The attack roll. And a natural one. Elementals can't roll today. And you're already on fire, so its fire form won't make much of a difference to you either way. All right, so that's going to end its turn, and the other elemental pours in, that's the end of their round. All right, that brings us to Gern.

CHRIS: Oh boy.

SAM: Feel the Gern, feel the Gern.

MATT: Flames are out, you push– not Stimpy– Coral off of you, Coral standing (groan).

CHRIS: Does it count as my turn if I ask him a question about the orb?

MATT: No, you can make a quick little aside. You have to shout it out, though.

CHRIS: If I attack the genie, is it just going to attack the orb, and then he's going to be free?

SAM: Yes! I'm not looking at you, by the way.

CHRIS: It really hurts, I didn't realize how much that hurt!

SAM: Yeah, I know!

CHRIS: I've learned a valuable lesson today, while I've half-caught on fire. Can I cast some type of a mental spell through the orb to the fire genie?

MATT: You can certainly try.

CHRIS: Would it be too crafty if I were to cast Modify Memory? Could I modify the fire genie's memory to forget to not kill himself? I'll take that as a no. Can I modify the fire genie's memory into thinking that he's completed the task that he came to this realm to complete, and that he might go home?

MATT: You can certainly try.

CHRIS: I'd love to try.

MATT: Okay. What's the range on the spell?

CHRIS: Infinity.

(laughter)

MATT: Modify Memory, where is it? There we go, 5th-level.

TALIESIN: Oh, God, I hope this works.

MATT: It's a 30-foot range, so you're going to have to get a lot closer. You're getting up from prone, which is half your movement, so you only have 15 more feet you can move, so you wouldn't be able to even get into range.

CHRIS: Oh, shit, I can't cast Modify Memory anyway, I've already cast two spells like that today.

MATT: That's true, Cone of Cold. You're out of fifth level.

CHRIS: So which way– is there a chain of people? I see a couple right there.

MARISHA: Here's a laser pointer if you need it.

CHRIS: Thank you. This guy's new, right?

MATT: Yeah, and this guy hasn't been touched really, except for her lightning arrow.

CHRIS: Oh, I can shoot lightning breath, right?

MATT: You can, yeah.

CHRIS: Should I shoot at this guy or this guy?

SAM: Well, the guy next to me might hit me, but whatever!

CHRIS: I'll throw some lightning breath at this person right here.

MATT: Okay, as you stand up and dust off yourself, your fantastic zipper-covered dance jacket, brushing it off with your hands, you lumber forward to the outskirts of this newly cracking rock crust that once was a lava pool and will soon be once again, inhale. As you guys look around, you see this glow, this blue crackling blow– glow on the inside of his mouth. The blow is how he got to the mountain and then got inspired to shoot the lightning.

CHRIS: I'm flying high, but I can't get an erection. I've done so much blow.

MATT: Gern Blanston. Flying high, no erection.

CHRIS: Sad.

MATT: This crackling electric energy in the back of his toothy mouth as he– (snarl) releases this blast of lightning energy forward, striking into the chest of the fire elemental that freshly stepped out of the portal. What's the saving throw DC on that?

CHRIS: 14.

MATT: 14. It rolled a nine, so go ahead and roll the damage on the breath. How much is it?

CHRIS: It's 4d6.

TRAVIS: Love the way you're rolling today.

MATT: I'm rolling really bad tonight!

CHRIS: Four, ten, 15, 16!

SAM: Yeah, that's good.

MATT: 16 points of lightning damage to that elemental. (impact) It pulls back from the blast. You can see its form has to reconvene. There's a little bit of black and gray smoke that billows out from the wound as it turns to you (snarling). You've definitely got its attention.

CHRIS: Hello!

MATT: With your bonus action, would you like to do anything with your compadres?

CHRIS: Oh, right. I still have two left, don't I?

MATT: Yes, you do.

SAM: You do like dancing.

CHRIS: I'd like to send them off to start dancing just to the left of this gentleman right here. Just to distract him a little bit, because I seem to have caught his attention, so I'd like to start a little dance party right there. This fellow right here, the zombie, can do a little break dancing, and then the skeleton can do a bit of the bird, and then maybe the worm.

MATT: All right. As the skeleton leaps down into the worm (crash), just flat laid out, cracking part of its pelvis…

CHRIS: Dancing without music.

MATT: Yep. No music whatsoever.

CHRIS: Is the zombie like (zombie groaning). The tip of his arm falls off at the ulna.

TALIESIN: Pop and lock! Pop and lock!

MATT: All right. I'm going to go ahead and–

CHRIS: These guys are great!

MATT: I'm going to ask you to go ahead and roll a performance check.

SAM: We never do those!

LAURA: I feel really bad that I killed Carol now.

MARISHA: Oh, that was almost bad.

TALIESIN: Wait, plus, plus–

SAM: Oh, you have inspiration!

MARISHA: You do!

LAURA: Use it!

SAM: Use a d10!

LIAM: This is the time.

CHRIS: Oh. So seven, plus performance plus one, eight, and then a d10.

LIAM: Roll the d10, add it.

CHRIS: Jesus Christ. Ten.

MATT: Ten. Trying to recall and hum the song that Scanlan once sang to you, naught but ten minutes before, you don't recall it much at all, and it comes out (tuneless humming).

CHRIS: (singing) Gern, Gern, It's Gern. It's Gern time!

SAM: Pitchy, little pitchy. Flat.

CHRIS: (singing) It's Gern, time to Gern!

SAM: Well, now you're sharp.

CHRIS: (singing) Gern it all the way. I'm doing great!

SAM: Yep, your name was in the song!

CHRIS: (singing) Gern is my name and this is definitely the song that I'm singing.

MATT: It's discordant enough that on a low wisdom save I'll say the fire elemental's next attack has disadvantage. That was the strangest round of combat I think I've ever had in D&D. All right, Percy, you're up. Follow that. First, top of your round, you take nine points of fire damage.

TALIESIN: That's halved to five.

LAURA: I have the skirmisher stealth! As a bonus action at the end of your turn, you can make a dexterity (stealth) check to hide again.

MATT: All right, cool, there you go. Perfect. Wasn't sure if you had to be hidden at the top to do it.

TALIESIN: I'm going to shift my Hex to the tiny little (Irish accent) fucker. God, you've got me doing it now. Damn it. It's a plague.

CHRIS: It's contagious.

MATT: To which one, this guy there?

TALIESIN: No no no, the one furthest from me.

MATT: Right there?

TALIESIN: Yeah, right there. I'll move my Hex to him. I'm going to bust out the Bad News rifle, I'm going to sit, and I'm going to take a nice, calm, calculated sharpshooter shot at him.

MATT: All righty.

TALIESIN: And Bad News just goes (click).

MATT: Did you misfire?

TALIESIN: I misfired.

MATT: Oh no! You get down with the gun and (click). You look at it and you can see some of the metal bowing in the centerpiece like, “That's bad. That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!”

TALIESIN: It's fine. I put it down, I pull out the pistol, and I'm going to take a shot.

MARISHA: It's hot. It's really hot. Just keep going.

TALIESIN: That was really awkward.

MARISHA: Maybe the heat made you misfire.

TRAVIS: Just roll the dice.

LIAM: You're also 60 feet apart at the moment.

TALIESIN: That's a 25 to hit.

MATT: 25 hits. Sharpshooter? No.

TALIESIN: Yeah.

MATT: That's sharpshooter? Wow. Nice roll.

TALIESIN: Six, 12, 22 points of damage. And I reload, and that's my turn.

MATT: That's your turn. Okay. Finishing up Percy, that brings us to Scanlan. You're still concentrating on Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.

SAM: Oh, yes I am.

LIAM: The gnome has got this.

SAM: Hey, how's that stuff under my feet?

MATT: Pretty rough. You're going to want to step off of it very soon, probably.

SAM: I'm going to step into it.

LIAM: Love you, Scanlan.

SAM: So I can fire a Lightning Bolt and hit both of those guys.

MATT: Oh, snap. Okay.

SAM: And yeah, that's it. That'll be my–

MATT: You can still move after that.

SAM: Oh, good! Okay, good, thank you for saving me.

MATT: So the bolt arcs past, go ahead.

CHRIS: I saw that, it was great!

SAM: Oh, for once! Thank you! Thank you, it was for you!

CHRIS: Much appreciated!

MATT: Five, no. And a 12 plus three, 15, no. Both fail their saving throw.

SAM: Okay, so 8d6?

MATT: 8d6 points of lightning damage to both of them. It's a wonderful display, Gern.

LIAM: I ship Scanlan and Gern.

CHRIS: Shh, guys, please.

SAM: 33.

MATT: 33, nice roll.

CHRIS: Oh, that Lightning Bolt was so big. And wide!

SAM: It's the width that really does it.

CHRIS: It really does. It's not so much the length.

TALIESIN: It's the girth of Gern.

SAM: And I will re-inspire Gern. Oh, wait, you're still injured, aren't you?

CHRIS: Yeah.

SAM: I will heal Gern.

CHRIS: Please.

SAM: With another Healing Word. This time at third level.

MATT: Technically, a second spell can only be as high as second level. You used two spells in one round.

LIAM: It's still very romantic, though.

SAM: Okay, I'll do a 2nd-level Healing Word, and I will sing to him, because I'm running out of things that rhyme with his name: (singing) Gern down for what! (EDM beat) Gern down for what! That's it.

CHRIS: Might I remind you I am unable to get an erection at the moment?

MATT: However, in spite of that, the blue pill does give you ten additional hit points healed.

LAURA: Did the skeleton and the zombie start dancing better, after that?

MATT: Yeah, it actually does pick up their pace a little bit now that they have a backtrack.

CHRIS: What is the elemental doing while they're dancing?

MATT: Well, it's currently being surrounded by a swirl of Hex shadow and looking around very confused and wondering why it got up in the morning.

TALIESIN: Where did the glow sticks come from?

MATT: Do you want to move out?

SAM: And I can move out?

MATT: Yeah, you can.

SAM: Will he take a swipe at me?

MATT: It will yes, but better than possibly falling in.

SAM: I'm still on fire, right?

MATT: Yes, you are. Takes an action to put it out, though, unfortunately. That's 18 plus six. I believe that does hit you. You take 12 points of fire damage.

SAM: Plus whatever I was on fire for.

MATT: You already took that damage earlier.

SAM: Oh, I did? At the beginning of my turn.

MATT: Yeah, I rolled for that already, you take nine points of fire damage, I think it was.

SAM: Oh, okay, plus 12?

MATT: Plus 12. If I'm wrong, whatever, it's fine. All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Keyleth.

MARISHA: So we have these two assholes in front of us.

LIAM: My name is Vax.

MARISHA: Well, depends on the day. So, that guy is still alive too, yeah?

MATT: Yeah, all three of these guys are alive. And this guy's in a hamster ball.

LAURA: Being pissed!

TALIESIN: It's just like a weather balloon.

MATT: Yeah it's a rover just holding him in place.

MARISHA: I'm going to Tidal Wave again. Tidal Wave! Right here, this way, fucking with these two guys.

MATT: All righty, let's go ahead and roll some saving throws on their end. ('The Prisoner' theme starts playing)

TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you.

MATT: Yeah. Six and an eight, both fail. Who is number one?

CHRIS: I am not a number, I'm a free man!

MATT: So good, so good. The original one, not the remake. Patrick McGoohan. Two failed saving throws, go ahead and roll damage on that.

MARISHA: It's really good, I'm warning you right now. Seven and seven is 14 plus another six, brings me to 20, plus eight, 28, again. That's what I had last time right? 28.

LIAM: Kismet.

MATT: 28 points of water damage, plus the additional blast of water gallons surging through them, manages to completely scatter both these guys.

TALIESIN: We actually had a Critter tweet us how much water.

MATT: How much water would be in a Tidal Wave?

TALIESIN: 225 gallons.

MATT: Oh, there is no way they're surviving that.

MARISHA: And then technically in Tidal Wave it says the water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in the area within 30 feet of it.

MATT: Unprotected flames are different than lava pools. Water doesn't cool it, it just evaporates.

TALIESIN: We've got steam.

MATT: You do. You have a very heavy cloud of steam now, that is (steam sound) to the side. The dancing skeleton and zombie are now just these shadows lit in this cool music video light now as they're (groan) dancing.

LIAM: As if this were a Telltale game, at the top of the screen it says, 'Keyleth will remember this'.

MATT: Exactly. Tidal Wave on fire elementals is nasty, man. (“Thriller” starts playing)

MARISHA: Can I use my bonus action–

MATT: Perfect. This is happening, guys. Is that the rest of your turn, Keyleth? Do you want to move somewhere?

MARISHA: Question.

MATT: Yes, what's your question?

MARISHA: Can I theoretically cast a Grasping Vine coming out of the hellmouth?

MATT: No, Grasping Vine is a 4th-level spell, I believe, and as a bonus action you can't do anything more than a 2nd-level spell in the same round.

MARISHA: Fuck, never mind. Actually, no, that's not true. I will take my bonus Healing Word to toss another Healing Word, just 1st-level, over to Gern.

MATT: Everyone's keeping the dance master alive over there.

CHRIS: Oh my god, amazing.

MARISHA: So you heal eight points, Gern.

MATT: Eight points of healing to you, Gern.

SAM: He's gone.

MATT: We can't save him. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: I use another reckless attack and I make the first strike against the guy right in front of me.

MATT: Go for it.

TRAVIS: Jesus. Better. 14.

MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately.

TRAVIS: Damn it.

MATT: Are these with great weapon master?

TRAVIS: No, just reckless attack. This one is with great weapon master. Nope. Better. 16 plus nine is 25, minus five is 20.

MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

TRAVIS: Yahtzee! Five, ten, 18, 28!

MATT: 28 points of damage, okay. This time, as you release the first blow of your sword forward, he catches it in the blade of the trident and deflects it off to the side, slamming it into the ground, almost pinning the weapon for a second. He gets up in your face and grins (snarls), and the actual breath that emanates from its teeth begins to burn and singe the edge of your beard hairs. That infuriates you, and you lift up Craven Edge between the blades of the trident. It's a test of strength as you both tense, and eventually you lift it back, and with the backswing, slash him right across his chest with that blow. You see a strike of extremely hot, hot blood splatter across, (sizzling), singe the front of your chest and leave little burn marks on you.

SAM: Yes!

TRAVIS: Like freckles.

LIAM: You don't want to fuck with his beard!

MATT: He does make the save.

CHRIS: She has a name.

LIAM: Sorry, Laura.

MATT: Well played. Does that end your turn?

TRAVIS: Yeah, that's the end of my turn.

LAURA: Why am I laughing at that?

TRAVIS: Darling, shush.

MATT: Efreet's going to start pushing against the ball, which is going to begin to coast through the air this way.

LIAM: Does he spin the globe?

MATT: Just gliding through slowly.

TRAVIS: Genie hamster.

MATT: Yeah, that's about all he can do this turn.

SAM: Sorry!

MATT: No, no, it's what you do. It's what you do. All right, Vax, you're up.

LIAM: Man, all right. I'm in a good spot, I'll just throw three more daggers at the salamander that Grog has not yet killed. First one is a natural 20, the second one is a 13, and the third one is, aw, fuck, is a 14.

MATT: Okay. Hold off on those two attacks, just in case how much your critical sneak attack does.

LIAM: Five, six, seven, eight, 12, 18, 21, 25. 25, so you double the dice, is 56 for the first one.

MATT: Okay, so as you throw the dagger, it goes right past Grog's ear and you hear the (whoosh) of the wind as it just brushes past your face. After you finish your backswing with Craven Edge, as the salamander creature rears back from the impact, it looks towards you, and its eyes twitch ever so slightly to your right as it sees the incoming blade a little too late as it (impact) right into its right eye socket. Its tongue lolls out of its jaw as it falls onto its back, and its tail moves and twitches for a few seconds before it eventually goes limp.

TRAVIS: No, no, he's still alive! And I kick him. Now he's dead.

MATT: Grog stomps it into the ground. The twitching stops, the salamander now destroyed.

TRAVIS: Does the dagger stay in his eye socket?

MATT: It's currently in the eye socket, yeah.

TRAVIS: Ooh. Can I reach down and grab it?

MATT: Yeah. You reach down and grab the dagger, and as you pull it out, (poof) it turns into smoke in your hand.

TRAVIS: Holy shit! I look back at Vax.

LIAM: Grog, how did you do that?

TRAVIS: I don't know! I think maybe I'm a magic user now! And I start trying to cast reanimate person on the dead thing.

MATT: Okay.

CHRIS: That's not how you do that!

TRAVIS: No, no, no, I've got to concentrate!

CHRIS: All right.

TRAVIS: (straining)

LAURA: Hey, Scanlan!

SAM: Oi!

LAURA: What are we going to do with this giant ball?

SAM: We need someone to bring him down to earth. Keyleth, can you vine him down? Or, Gern, do you have something that can move things?

MARISHA: Can I–

CHRIS: Go ahead.

MARISHA: No, go, you first. Please, Gern.

LIAM: Does anyone have a large purple hand they could use?

TALIESIN: I think he would lose–

MARISHA: Yeah, it's a concentration spell.

MATT: Yeah, one spell at a time.

CHRIS: I thought I had some sort of a Telekinesis spell, but I guess I don't.

SAM: Chromatic Orb?

MARISHA: No, that's an attack.

LAURA: Can you bring it down, Keyleth?

MARISHA: I can try. Can I do a Grasping Vine from the bottom underneath of him, and see if I can?

LIAM: He's over lava.

SAM: He's got something!

CHRIS: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

MATT: What are you doing? I know what you're doing, what are you doing?

CHRIS: I could either manipulate his memory, or I do have a flying broom.

SAM: What?

LIAM: Yes?

CHRIS: Yes, I have a flying broom.

TRAVIS: Like you do.

LAURA: Are you going to bat him down like you're sweeping the sky?

CHRIS: I could fly up and gently glide him down.

LAURA: How come everybody flies?

MATT: Are you doing your vine as well?

MARISHA: Let me see how this goes first.

MATT: So, without any other command, your two friends, Coral and Stimpy, are still over there dancing as the mist slowly dissipates from the deluge. You pull out from the side of your little satchel there your flying broom, which is a pretty decent, medium-sized broom, places it in the air and it rests there, slightly shifting in place. You leap up onto it and grab onto the front as you shoot up from the side.

CHRIS: Going up to catch the golden bitch!

LAURA: There's flying brooms?!

MATT: As you place yourself on top of Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, placing all your weight onto it, it sinks a little bit, then it comes to a halt. About three feet it sinks, as you're just standing on top of it.

MARISHA: That's as far as it goes?

MATT: What do you want to do?

CHRIS: I'd like to try to cast a memory spell on it, if possible.

MATT: Okay. Well, you've already cast a 5th-level spell twice, how many 5th-level spells can you cast per day?

CHRIS: Two.

MATT: Yeah, unfortunately you're out of 5th-level slots.

CHRIS: Could I cast it on you to forget that I've already cast it twice?

LIAM: Scanlan, how much time do we have with this bubble?

SAM: A minute, but about 30 seconds have gone by.

MATT: Yeah, you're getting down to about the 40-second mark.

TALIESIN: Can I put myself out while all of this is happening?

MATT: Yes, you can do that.

SAM: Can he push down?

MATT: You can jump onto it and begin to push down.

CHRIS: I'm going to push down with all my might, to try to get him down on the ground.

MATT: You leap in the air and jump on it again and as you do the orb (sinking noise) and just slowly, over the next 15 seconds shove it down to the point where you're over the orb on the very top, as you can feel the spell about to dissipate.

LIAM: Grog, Grog! Stop trying to reanimate that thing and hit the freaking red guy into the hole!

MATT: Grog, go ahead and roll an arcana check.

SAM: Oh, he's the best at arcana.

LIAM: 20. Get it. Get it. Reanimate that fucker.

TRAVIS: Six.

MATT: Six. This isn't working.

TRAVIS: Must be a rookie mistake.

SAM: What are we trying to do, shove him back into the hole?

TALIESIN: Shove him in the hole!

LIAM: Grog, shove that fucking thing in there.

TRAVIS: He's over lava.

LIAM: You are made of hit points!

TRAVIS: All right, fuck it– This is your thing.

MARISHA: Can I do the vines from out of the portal?

MATT: No, it has to have an anchor point somewhere.

TRAVIS: All right, fuck it, now I just run, in a rage, I run into the lava and I start shoving him straight toward the flaming vagina hole.

MATT: Okay, I want you to make an athletics check. Actually, no, this would be a full strength check. Just roll a strength check. You have advantage because you're still raging. Although you wouldn't be raging anymore because you spent time concentrating on the spell, you could go into a rage for this if you'd like to, spend another use of your rage.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll use another one.

MATT: Okay, you go into a rage. All right, as you step into the lava, you suffer 26 points of fire damage from wading up to your knees in molten rock.

MARISHA: Halved.

MATT: Halved because of your resistance.

TRAVIS: So 12. I rolled a 22.

MATT: 22. With that you, (boof), you shove the sphere, which shifts back about halfway to there. You have to catch yourself on the side, grabbing the broom and holding it out here as you're stepping the other direction. I want you to make an acrobatics check.

CHRIS: All right. Seven.

MATT: Seven.

TALIESIN: You have inspiration!

SAM: Nope. He used it.

MATT: As you (slipping noise) slip off the top of the sphere, begin to fall back toward the lava behind you, in a very Lord of the Rings Gollum tumbling into Mount Doom type of view. (sploosh) Back first into the lava.

LAURA: Oh shit.

CHRIS: I feel fine.

MATT: Actually, you take six points of fire damage. Impacting– rolled really low on that. (sploosh) You can feel the back of your scales and the flesh on your back immediately begin to burn with horrifying pain. You're holding your broom aloft, 'cause you don't want that to go in the fire.

LAURA: I run forward to try to help him out.

SAM: And steal the broom.

MATT: And with that, the sphere breaks.

(disgruntled moans)

LIAM: Crap.

MARISHA: Can Keyleth run up, do I have an action?

MATT: Right now we're going back to the initiative order, since combat has re-initiated with the sphere opened. That brings us to the top. The efreet, now freed from its sphere, is going to go first.

LIAM: He's mad.

MATT: He is livid. All right.

TRAVIS: I just want you to know, I was trying to free you.

SAM: I don't know these people.

LIAM: These assholes.

TRAVIS: Can you believe how rude these people are?

MATT: He's going to fly back up.

(groans)

MATT: Keep away. Let's see. It's going to cast Invisibility on itself, then it vanishes from view.

MARISHA: Great.

SAM: As it does that, do I recognize the spell?

MATT: You do.

SAM: I cast Counterspell.

MATT: Yes, you can. Go ahead and roll– Oh, wait, no, it's a 2nd-level spell. It auto– Yeah. Yeah. Because it is a 2nd-level spell.

SAM: Hi!

TALIESIN: Yeah!

MATT: As its form begins to vanish, Scanlan, what do you do to counter it?

SAM: I'm going to sing– No! I'm going to distract it with this.

TALIESIN: With an app?

SAM: With an app. (airhorn) (song starts) Oh, wait that's not what I wanted to do!

CHRIS: Keep going! Distract him with your morning radio program!

MATT: And that bit of chaos is just enough, as he begins to cast his innate Invisibility spell, it looks over. “What in the– Shit!” And loses the spell concentration. The invisibility field vanishes, and it stands there above. All right, that brings us to Vax.

LIAM: Oh, shite. All right, I'm going to leap over the lava pit.

MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

LIAM: Yeah. That'll be a 28. I run up behind Grog, and I should be within–

MATT: Darting around the side there, because you are hasted with this, so you can actually just dart around the side.

LIAM: All right, right behind Grog. I should be within 60 feet of the efreeti.

MATT: Yes.

LIAM: And I'll throw three daggers at it.

MATT: Go for it.

LIAM: First one is a 34.

MATT: That hits.

LIAM: Second one is a 27. Third is a 29, so they all hit.

MATT: Shit, jeez, 34.

LIAM: But there's no sneak attack on these–

MATT: How did you get 34 on your attack?

LIAM: I don't know anymore. I rolled really high, and I rolled my attack bonus, like a 19 plus 11? A 30?

MATT: 30, okay.

LIAM: I don't know.

MATT: That's okay. A 30 works.

LIAM: Math looked right when I did it.

MATT: 34, I was just like (groaning) bleeding from the nose, I couldn't deal with it. 30 hits.

LIAM: There's no subterfuge, it might be stupidity. First one's a ten, second one was a ten, and the third one is a seven.

MATT: Seven. Got it. Cool. That ends your turn, Vax. That brings us to Vex.

LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

MATT: All right. It is…

LAURA: It wasn't, because I used Lightning Arrow, so it dropped the concentration on it.

MATT: That's right, so you Hunter's Mark once again. Put that back on there. All right.

LAURA: Although it doesn't really matter because I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow on him and I lose my Hunter's Mark again.

TRAVIS: Trauma from the earlier episodes. Hunter's Mark!

MATT: All right, so Lightning Arrow again, go ahead and roll for the attack.

LAURA: Oh yeah! Oh, that's 31?

LIAM: 79!

LAURA: 31!

MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

LAURA: Okay!

MATT: Gern, you're on deck.

LAURA: 23!

MATT: 23 points of damage, all righty.

LAURA: That's better.

MATT: (impact) The lightning slams into his chest, and you can see it arcs through its scimitar that it's holding up in its hand, and it shakes and almost drops the weapon, and catches its arm as the electricity disperses out the edge of the blade and looks back at you. He's now glaring at both you and Scanlan.

LAURA: I'm going to use my movement to run up around the molten lava and hold my hand out for Gern, so that he can use me to get out of the molten lava.

MATT: All right, that's as far as you can get there.

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: Gern, top of your turn, you take 24 points of fire damage from the lava as you're sinking into it. (sizzling)

CHRIS: So, can I jump up and then cast a spell?

MATT: Right now you can try and cast, in this area, but you would have a hard time concentrating. I'd say you'd have to take a concentration check to even get a spell out, because you're in so much pain. I'd say you would probably want to move out of the lava before you do that.

CHRIS: All right, I'll get out of the lava.

MATT: So you (straining) stand up.

LAURA: Take my hand!

MATT: It's too deep and you're having to basically wade your way through, which is burning your hands as you get over there.

CHRIS: What about my broom?

MATT: You were holding your broom! So here's what you do. You go ahead and you lift yourself up out of the lava onto the broom and then (blowing) push. You're not fully on it, and it's hard to engage its mental commands directly with the current amount of chaos around you, but you do manage to skirt yourself to the very edge of the lava and land on your feet, which are numb after the sheer amount of pain you've suffered, and you don't even want to look down at what you look like from the waist below.

LAURA: Do you need me to hold your broom while you cast your spell?

CHRIS: Please!

LAURA: Thank you!

SAM: Oh, don't do– Okay.

MATT: So she takes the broom from your hand. What are you going to cast?

CHRIS: Disintegrate.

MATT: Okay!

TRAVIS: Disintegrate?

SAM: That's a spell?

LIAM: That's a big one, we've seen that happen.

SAM: We have?

MARISHA: Yes.

SAM: Who did that?

LIAM: The giants got disintegrated.

CHRIS: I'm fairly pissed at the moment.

MATT: As you should be. All right, so you get to go ahead and roll.

LIAM: Get the fucker, you dirty bastard.

MATT: Let me get to the spell here real fast. Disintegrate. Oh, it just makes a dexterity saving throw! It doesn't even get a chance. All right, what's your spell DC again?

CHRIS: 16.

MATT: 16. It rolled a two.

LAURA: Yes!

MATT: That's going to be bad. All right, roll 10d6 plus 40 damage. Damn!

TRAVIS: 10d6?

MATT: Disintegrate doesn't mess around. It's an all or nothing spell. If they make the save, nothing. You don't make it, (explosion).

CHRIS: 27, 33, 36… So 76!

MATT: 76 points of force damage. As you get out, you can see your vest itself is burning, there's still elements of embers burning at the edges of the leather and the cloth. The bottom part of your scales are a combination of blue, black, and little bits have cracked open where you can see red flesh underneath. There's a lot of burn damage.

CHRIS: The zippers are very hot, I might add.

MATT: They're really glowing. However, as you turn around, as your fin jewelry on the sides of your face jangles with the speed as you spin around and point your finger upward, the arcane energy forming at the end of your finger, this singular beam of dull green arcane energy streaks forward. The efreet, who is currently focused on Scanlan and watching Vex run past, looks down just in time to see you release the spell. Opens his eyes and attempts to dodge out of the way, unfortunately not fast enough. It blasts in the side of its shoulder and you can see as a whole chunk of its back muscle, shoulder, and lower torso are just turned to dust, exposing bone and elements of its musculature and flesh underneath. It goes (snarls) and looks down. It can't even make a loud emission of pain, it's just gutturally whispering its horrible suffering. As it looks down, it reaches up with its hand and cauterizes the wound on the back of its body, leaving it a charred cinder. It glares down at you, extremely angry. “I hate you most of all, scarecrow!”

CHRIS: Go back to your fire slit!

MATT: Percy, you're up. Unless you want your dudes to do anything, by the way. They're still over there dancing.

CHRIS: They should get a little bit closer and dance in front of him, just to make sure. They get very self-conscious if no one's paying attention.

SAM: Of course.

MATT: They're just cheering on.

TRAVIS: At least they're dancing while I'm standing on fire.

TALIESIN: Can I knock him down a notch? Can I try and shoot him to drop him out of the sky a bit?

MATT: You can certainly try.

TALIESIN: I'm going to try. First of all, I'm going to Hex him. He's hexed. I point.

MATT: All right, so the Hex moves over.

TALIESIN: Hex moves over. And I'm going to take a shot to try and drop him. I'm going to take a grit shot to drop him.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: That's 22.

MATT: 22 hits.

TALIESIN: And that's, what's the saving throw for that? Strength throw.

MATT: Strength? 23.

TALIESIN: Aw, really?

MATT: Yeah. Sorry.

TALIESIN: That's fine, he'll just take his damage.

MATT: Little bitch. Plus 1d6, don't forget.

TALIESIN: Yes, thank you.

MATT: Wow, Disintegrate spell fucked him up.

TALIESIN: That's 17 points of damage.

MATT: Nice.

TALIESIN: I'm going to shoot again.

MATT: Is this with your pistol?

TALIESIN: Yeah, just with the pistol right now.

MATT: And what's your first range increment on that?

TALIESIN: 400.

MATT: The pistol?

TALIESIN: Yeah. 1,200 for Bad News.

MATT: Your first range increment.

TALIESIN: I'm sharpshooter, I have no range increment.

MATT: That's right. Good call. All right, so fire again.

TALIESIN: Range increments are for– We don't do that here.

MATT: Yeah.

TALIESIN: That's a 31 to hit.

MATT: That hits, roll damage. Scanlan, you're up next, by the way.

TALIESIN: And that's 16 points of damage.

MATT: All righty. (two impacts) Just as it manages to cauterize the wounds from the Disintegrate spell, both bullets blast into its torso, and you can see it's now, thinking the height advantage would be helpful, after being locked in a hamster ball and now being repeatedly blasted from every which way, it's not enjoying its current experience by any means.

TALIESIN: It's going to get worse. All right, and now I'm doing a sharpshooter shot.

MARISHA: Pew pew.

TALIESIN: Pew pew. That's 18?

MATT: 18 hits.

TALIESIN: And that's 12, 18, 28 points of damage.

MATT: Nice! This one (impact) blasts into the center of its chest, and you can see part of its pectoral muscle tears open and flame erupts from the impact. It reaches up and (snarling).

TALIESIN: Action surge. Fuck this guy. Same thing, sharpshooter. I'm going to be rolling sharpshooter.

MATT: Go for it, okay.

LIAM: Get the other nipple, now?

TALIESIN: The other nipple.

MARISHA: Matching piercings.

TALIESIN: 22.

MATT: 22 hits. This is going to be a rough round for him.

TALIESIN: 27 points of damage.

MATT: Ooh!

TALIESIN: Reload and one more shot!

LAURA: Jesus Christ! I mean.

TALIESIN: Reload, one more shot.

MATT: You got it.

TALIESIN: That's 17, 27, 29–

MATT: That's a hit. Go for it, roll damage.

TALIESIN: That hits.

MATT: Damn, man.

TALIESIN: 21 points of damage.

MATT: All right. (two impacts) These holes are beginning to appear in its body where the bits of fiery flesh are being blasted away from the impacts of your weapon. All right, that brings us to Scanlan!

LAURA: It didn't kill him?

TALIESIN: No, but he's a sieve now.

MATT: You guys held him–

LIAM: He just took 100 points of damage.

TALIESIN: He took a lot of damage.

SAM: Hey, that Ioun stone that I have? Does that allow me to cast a fourth level three spell?

MATT: If the spell you put into it was a fourth 3rd-level spell, yeah.

SAM: It was a 3rd-level spell, so it's an extra 3rd-level spell?

MATT: Right.

SAM: I'm maxed out on 3rd-level spells, but I still have that thing.

MATT: Yeah, so it wouldn't be a 4th-level spell because you didn't cast into it as a 4th-level.

SAM: No, I mean, the fourth time I've cast a 3rd-level spell.

MATT: Oh, got you. It wouldn't count against your daily. It's in addition to that.

SAM: Okay! So I will, for the first time ever, use that stupid Ioun stone and cast Lightning Bolt again. I'm just sticking with my method here.

MATT: All right, all right. With a five, it does not make its saving throw. Go ahead and roll damage. 8d6.

SAM: 8d6, thank you.

LIAM: Here comes the cube.

CHRIS: 23, 28.

SAM: Thank you. Did you do this one too? 28!

MATT: How do you want to do this?

(cheering)

TRAVIS: Both kills! Both of them!

SAM: I think I would like to, if there's a way, I'd like to angle it somehow so that he will drop right on top of Grog. I feel like Grog can do something to a falling behemoth.

MATT: It's hard-pressed from this angle, unfortunately. Grog is at an angle where you wouldn't really be able to do that.

SAM: Damn it.

MATT: Mind you, when you blast him, he'll plummet close to his feet, if you wanted to.

SAM: All right, yes, let's do that so Grog can feel like he gets part of this, too. And if I can, I'd like to burn a big S in his chest.

MATT: So, as you charge up and blast the lightning bolt from your crotch region, you then do a little dance maneuver with your waist, causing it to (crackling) carve a Scanlan S into the torso of the efreet. As it plummets to the ground, slamming into where the lava would be, while the fire doesn't hurt its form, you can see, Grog, as it stands in the ground (groaning). Its form is turning into ash around you. It's actually just dissipating and turning to ash as its eyes roll up and meet with yours.

TRAVIS: I run over in the lava and I go, I'd like to cast Beheading!

MATT: All right. You suffer 26 points of fire damage, reduced to 13 from taking another round in there.

TRAVIS: Not a problem. Totally worth it for the spell.

MATT: As you take Craven Edge and take the head off. As the head rolls away–

TRAVIS: I grab it!

MATT: You grab it! It turns to ash.

TRAVIS: (panting) I run out of the lake.

MATT: You get out of the lava, stand on the side, and look over just as the rest of the head turns to ashes.

TRAVIS: Aw, shit.

LAURA: I walk up to Grog.

LIAM: You did it again!

LAURA: I pat him on the shoulder, and say, that was so impressive. A genuine mage! And I use sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the Bag of Holding.

MATT: Okay. Roll sleight of hand.

TALIESIN: Whoa!

LIAM: Yeah, girl.

CHRIS: Am I allowed to roll a perception?

MATT: Yes, you can.

LIAM: Come on, Vex. Come on, sister.

LAURA: 18?

LIAM: Get it.

CHRIS: 16.

MATT: Plus?

TALIESIN: No.

MATT: Total of 16?

CHRIS: 15 plus one, yeah.

MATT: As you're dealing with this, you have no notice of this. You may question it later, if you like, but you have no idea where it went, and didn't see any of this transaction happen.

LAURA: Oh no! Oh no!

SAM: What, what is it?

LAURA: Your broom fell in the lava!

CHRIS: What?

LAURA: I saw it!

CHRIS: I just turned around for a moment!

LAURA: I tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava!

CHRIS: Are you sure?

LAURA: Yeah!

MATT: Make a deception check.

SAM: You shouldn't have looked at me when I cast my spell!

CHRIS: This is why I never looked at you before!

SAM: I was wrong to doubt you!

CHRIS: No! No, you're a constant source of disappointment!

LAURA: 18.

CHRIS: Where's my fucking broom?

MATT: Make an insight check now.

CHRIS: Insight. 13.

MATT: 13. She's telling the truth, man. That broom just went straight in the lava.

SAM: You're a horrible person.

CHRIS: You know, I'm really good at reading people, and I know that you're telling me the truth right now.

LAURA: I'm so sorry.

CHRIS: No, I feel your sorrow. I feel it. I feel bad for you, that you have to experience that! It's just a broom. Right? It's just a flying broom that's very difficult to find, no big deal.

LAURA: I wouldn't know. I don't even know.

CHRIS: That's all right. You know, it actually– It sterilized me, actually, I'm quite glad. It has very dirty properties. Anyone that would put it between their legs to fly around would be in horrible danger. Horrible danger. So it's actually probably for the better.

SAM: Communicable diseases?

CHRIS: Yeah, so many STDs. It's really just like a disease tampon, is really what it is.

LIAM: A what? Is that like a magic candle?

CHRIS: It's sort of like a magic candle.

LAURA: A tragedy candle.

CHRIS: It's a tragedy candle.

TALIESIN: A Blanston candle.

CHRIS: Yes.

LIAM: I don't understand sorcery at all.

MATT: At this point, you hear the flickering of flame and the portal itself has begun to expand even further, glowing brighter.

MARISHA: Keyleth throws up a Skywrite spell and says, we're taking the portal.

MATT: Okay. As this is happening, the flames themselves grow higher and higher. The lava begins to boil and roil. As you guys all move up to the side, you can see the lava is beginning to (bubbling) splash out and spray bits are starting to scatter as some of the nearby trees tumble over. You can see the four Fire Ashari as well as Korrin come across one of the clearings. The other way, you see what looks to be another salamander gets thrown about 15 feet from the trees, hits the ground, skids, and is motionless as you see Cerkonos with the rest of the Pyrah, the Fire Ashari stepping through. “Keyleth. We saw your symbol. Is it time?”

MARISHA: Yes.

MATT: “All right. Let us try to close this rift.” And the rest of the druids all begin to gather around the outside of this portal. As it's flickering, you can see, piercing into the extremely blinding light, Keyleth, you take a moment, and using your attachment to the Fire Ashari and the Fire Elemental Plane from your last passage through it, you can see past the brightness and see beyond the doorway. You can see on the other side, there appears to be probably another half dozen or a dozen or so of a few other elementals and salamanders that are now making their way towards the portal.

MARISHA: I stand next to my father and join the rest of the druids.

LAURA: Grog, you should probably help them with all of your magic powers.

TRAVIS: Do you think so? It feels like it's an intimate thing.

LAURA: Just hold your hands up, hold your hands up.

TRAVIS: All right.

MATT: All right. As the rest of the Ashari begin to gather around the portal and concentrate, they are managing to hold the rift in its current size. You see as beads of sweat begin to pour down Korrin's face, not used to this type of terrain. He goes (gasps), “We need more power!”

TRAVIS: Okay!

MATT: “If you can aid, whatever you have to bring to this, please, now is the time!” Does anyone wish to help with the ritual?

LAURA: Oh, yeah.

CHRIS: I'll help.

MATT: All right, how would you wish to help?

SAM: What a nice guy he is! Certainly not someone we should swindle!

LIAM: Strange that you would say that.

CHRIS: I would know if someone were trying to swindle me, believe me.

SAM: That's true. That is true!

CHRIS: You all have honest faces. Particularly her, over there. Very honest face. What can I do to help?

MATT: What do you think would lend itself to a fire gate-sealing ritual? It could be a spell, it could be a use of a skill. How would you like to–?

SAM: A candle? Do you have any candles that could aid?

LAURA: Like fiery candles, maybe?

CHRIS: I have a– No, this one casts– This is bright light, there's a thunder candle. Blink candle. Destroy– No, that destroys dexterity. I have a thunder candle, but I don't know if that would work.

MATT: Make an arcana check.

CHRIS: 19.

MATT: 19. The Blink candle, which you crafted from various parts from blink dogs and other creatures that have natural translocation capabilities, might have the capability, as this is a doorway between planes, and teleportation magic is based on creating short-form doorways between similar spaces, might have some impact on the ritual if used properly.

CHRIS: I have this Blink candle. It's formed from various animals that blink and if– that has trans-dimensional properties, very good properties. The best kind of robust properties that I can throw it in, and it might help stop the– from– all of that.

TRAVIS: That makes perfect sense.

CHRIS: Right. So we're all in agreement, then.

SAM: Well-explained!

CHRIS: All right. So I'm going to hand Blink candle to Coral and I'm going to have Coral walk into the portal.

TRAVIS: Brave Coral.

CHRIS: Brave Coral. Fuck, I've lost two and my broom. What a fucking terrible day.

MATT: As Coral takes the candle, (groans) turns around and begins to just slowly melt, steps into the lava.

LIAM: Run, Coral, run!

MATT: Nine points of fire damage to Coral who was already sitting at–

CHRIS: Six.

MATT: And had taken six damage, right? So 15 from 33. Coral's at half health. Coral, as this is rough terrain, gets part of the way there, then continues walking forward the rest of the way. Takes an additional 17 points of damage.

LAURA: Oh no.

MATT: So that's 32 points of damage. What's Coral's hitpoints? 33 is the max?

LAURA: That's what you said.

MATT: Yep. On the sheet right there. I can read my own text. 33 hit points. Coral, at one hitpoint, gets up to the lava, take the candle and (boof). As the energy expands from it, you can see a ripple, a heat wave ripple, that billows outward. Coral vanishes entirely and the portal shrinks down by about five to six feet, actually closing in its space

CHRIS: Oh, Coral, I forgot to tell you somethi– fuck.

MATT: Suddenly you hear a (zip) and Coral appears about ten, 15 feet in the air–

CHRIS: Oh good, there you are. Listen, did you see my broom?

MATT: Smack! Coral falls those 15 feet, taking six points of bludgeoning damage. Let's see if Coral survives this with Undead Fortitude. Nope. That is a roll of eight versus a total DC of 11 with the damage taken, and Coral just splats like a really, really old orange just slammed into the concrete, just (splatting).

TRAVIS: Like an old orange.

MATT: One of the Fire Ashari goes (cringing, gagging) and just ends up concentrating on holding the gate.

CHRIS: I'm starting to think you're all very bad luck.

MATT: However, that did aid the ritual. We have two more folks who could aid in this ritual.

LAURA: I can use– I don't know if it will help, but I have a really great diamond of awesomeness that's precious.

MATT: How would that help the ritual?

LAURA: I don't know.

MARISHA: Am I a part of the people who could be included in the ritual too?

MATT: Yeah. Oh yeah.

MARISHA: Okay. I am going to cast a 7th-level Plane Shift to help smush it closed.

MATT: All right, go ahead and make a nature roll with advantage. This is your understanding of the natural elements of the world around you and the connection you have with the fire elemental plane.

LAURA: I don't know how this magic stuff works.

TRAVIS: Oh, I'll teach you later.

MARISHA: 12. Oh, with advantage. 23

MATT: 23. As you begin to concentrate, your hands instinctively burst into flames to coalesce your connection to the Fire Elemental Plane. As you complete the Plane Shift spell, your form shimmers for a second, and for a moment it looks like she's only partially there. She's actually translucent, as flames begin to lick up the sides of her body. At this point, you can see the lava flow in the mountain begins to slow and the bubbling begins to come to a stillness. The portal itself shimmers again and then shrinks down to the size of a normal doorway, about five foot by ten foot tall, and it's just barely holding on. As you're concentrating on holding it in its place, you can see now the rest of the druids around are sweating profusely. Who wishes to take on the last part of this ritual?

TRAVIS: I have a Firebrand Warhammer. I could hit it. Anybody else got anything better?

LAURA: Do you have any magic stuff, Scanlan?

SAM: I can inspire them. I mean…

TRAVIS: Your Dimension Door?

MARISHA: Do you have your Dimension Door?

SAM: Dimension Door what?

MARISHA: A door. I did Planar Binding, which technically really wasn't supposed to do what I just did–

MATT: Planar Shift you said.

MARISHA: Planar Shift, I mean, yes. 7th-level.

MATT: Finding ways to tailor magic essences into this type of a ritual.

SAM: Do I know that that will work or help?

MATT: You don't know. You'll find out. However you wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would be helpful in this instance.

LIAM: There's something I could do.

TRAVIS: Yeah, spit it up.

LIAM: I whip the Cape of the Mountebank out of my pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge and just try to balloon umbrella it down over with that red cape.

MATT: Hmm. Okay.

LAURA: Matador it.

LIAM: I'm doing it. I'm matadoring it.

MATT: Okay. I will say– hmm. How do I make this work? I'm going to want you to go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

LIAM: Okay. That is a 25.

MATT: All right. You rush up, leaping off the side, spinning in the air. As you, do you unfurl the cape and turn it into a limited parachute-type projection and as you slam it down towards– I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom check to see if you have the capability of triggering the magic of the item at the right time to be impactful.

LIAM: Cross your fingers, everybody.

TRAVIS: Come on, Vax.

LIAM: No bonuses here.

CHRIS: No whammys.

MARISHA: We don't still have our fancy feast, do we?

SAM: Oh, yeah, are we still feasting?

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: So what does that mean? Advantage.

MARISHA: You have advantage on wisdom throws.

LIAM: That's better. That is 13.

MATT: 13? That's better. As you come down, you take the cape and encase, you trigger the magic, at which point the remainder of this doorway just blinks out entirely, the cape gone. The doorway, gone.

LIAM: Hot hot hot hot hot.

MATT: As Vax (splashing) right into the lava.

MARISHA: I take a Grasping Vine from the edge and try and yank him back.

MATT: Okay. You take 22 points of fire damage as you splat into the lava.

LIAM: The Deathwalker's Ward is set to fire.

MATT: So it resisted to 11. So you (splashing) in the lava. All of a sudden, images flash in your head of the time that you lost most of your foot in the Underdark. And you go–

LIAM: No no no no no no no no!

MATT: And, before you can even react, all of a sudden, something wraps around your waist and yanks you out as a vine pulls you in an arc and slams you into the hard obsidian floor on the outside of the lava flow. The rest of you gather there as the rest of the druids finish their concentration. The lava pools themselves have gone still and you can see elements beginning to cool, and there's currently no sign of a tear between the elemental planes that's currently bursting through.

TRAVIS: Nice job, Vax!

LIAM: Where am I, am I near her, on the ground?

MATT: She would be back here. You're on the ground, right next to a dancing skeleton.

MARISHA: I moved up, I moved up. I would be over there.

MATT: You would be part of the ritual. But you fell next to the dancing skeleton.

LIAM: Okay, I look at the skeleton, I look at her. I look at the skeleton, I look at her. I'm an idiot.

MARISHA: Yeah, no, I already knew that. It's fine. You did good. You did good. I reach down and I help him on his feet. How bad are you?

LIAM: I'm pretty bad.

MARISHA: I Cure Wounds, level four.

TRAVIS: Yeah, cool, do that. I'm going to walk out of the lava now.

(laughter)

MATT: Taking another 21 points of fire damage. Reduced to ten. The druids look around and give a nod of acceptance. All of them acknowledge you, who they have not met and don't understand quite where you came from or why you're here. One of them, who is currently missing an arm on one hand. Dark, weathered skin, long jet black hair cruising down to the middle of his back, approaches you and his one right arm he puts on the shoulder and says, into your eyes, “I do not know you, friend, but you have come to our aid at an hour when we really required it.”

CHRIS: Great, sure, I just thought I'd come and lose a couple of thralls and my fucking broom. But great to be here. Everyone seems nice. Especially her, she's great.

MATT: He removes his hand. “Very well.”

CHRIS: Let me know if I can do anything else! Do you want a candle?

MATT: “Candle?”

CHRIS: Well, I make candles, just various candles.

MATT: He does this and his finger bursts into flame and you can see a flame flickering. “We do not need candles here in Pyrah. But thank you.”

LIAM: Is that the finger? Or is that the finger?

MATT: Insinuated, actual finger. At this point, Korrin, your father, approaches you and places a hand on your shoulder, and turns you around to look you in the face. And you can see there's smears of dirt and still glistening from sweat from the whole ritual and looks a bit weathered and winded from the experience. "Keyleth, I'm proud of you.”

MARISHA: Thank you, Father.

MATT: I think we will stay here and help the Pyrah try and rebuild.

MARISHA: Oh. Okay.

MATT: And he takes your chin and pulls it up and looks you in the face with a broad smile on his face, he says, “The road before you, Keyleth, is hard and fraught with loss and sadness. To live is to struggle against the void. But it's those moments of darkness that define the joy of the world around them. Learn from the loss and push forward as a beacon of perseverance, of hope for life after pain. This is one of the pillars of strength of a leader. One that I have learned with the loss of your mother. But you are my beacon of hope. And to many more than you even expect.” And he looks back towards the four other members of the Zephrah tribe that are all just looking at you, and they nod.

MARISHA: I hope I do not fail you, Father.

MATT: “I trust you will not. Go forth, while we stay here. I want you to grasp your destiny, vanquish this terrible beast that lies on the shores of Tal'Dorei. Complete your Aramente.”

MARISHA: How do you know that this is my destiny?

MATT: “Whatever your destiny is, grasp it. But you've chosen this path, and all destiny really is, is the choices you make, leading towards a goal that perhaps you do not yet understand. But when you've returned I wish for you to teach us the wisdom you've gained on this journey.”

MARISHA: Kaitiakè, father.

MATT: “Kaitiakè, Keyleth.”

CHRIS: Did you see a broom lying around anywhere?

MATT: “No.”

CHRIS: Sorry.

MATT: “It's all right, we will keep an eye out for it though.”

CHRIS: Please. And tell everyone #feelthegern. They'll know what it means.

SAM: What is a hashtag?

CHRIS: I'll explain later.

SAM: All right.

MATT: “Well, unless there's anything else, we have business to attend to in restoring this area. I wish you all great luck. ”

MARISHA: Korrin, If we should ever need you– if I should ever need you, or the assistance of the Ashari, what is the best way to get hold of you?

MATT: “Call to Zephrah. Come home. And we will come with you.” As he looks over all of you, giving each a look of– a nod of respect and appreciation– (“Don't You” by Simple Minds plays)

LIAM: Wow.

TALIESIN: I felt it coming.

MATT: Glances past to Grog, Vex, and lingers a very long look on Vax, and just gives you a nod.

LAURA: His diamond earring is glistening in the light.

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: Did I stutter?

MATT: “Stay safe. For her sake.” And Korrin turns around and walks back, as the rest of the Zephrah Ashari walk along with him. You, through all this chaos, get a little bored and frustrated with all this weird nonsensical stuff, look at the ground and realize there's a lot of hidden treasures scattered amongst this vicinity.

CHRIS: Probably so. You know, I might stay behind a bit and dig around for a little while. You know, candlemaking's a difficult business.

SAM: Is it now?

CHRIS: Aye.

TALIESIN: Well, if you're ever looking for more customers, you'll always find them in Whitestone. So, if you make your way north.

CHRIS: Excellent!

TALIESIN: You're always welcome.

CHRIS: Thank you. Could someone heal me a bit before you leave? I'm quite singed.

TALIESIN: Oh my!

LAURA: I walk up and I cast Cure Wounds on him. I've got jack shit.

CHRIS: She's so nice!

SAM: She's great.

CHRIS: She's the nicest!

LAURA: At a level three for you!

CHRIS: That's really nice of you.

TRAVIS: You're a really good person.

LAURA: I am! I am. 20 points.

TRAVIS: Holy shit!

SAM: Vex?

LAURA: Yes?

SAM: This gentleman has done nothing but aid us.

LAURA: I know, and it's so kind of him.

SAM: He's suffered the loss of three of his–

LAURA: Look at all these treasures he's going to find here for his candles!

SAM: Is there anything we can do to repay you?

MATT: Make an investigation check.

TRAVIS: That scimitar that the genie had, did it fall into the lava?

MATT: Yes.

LAURA: 18.

MATT: As you look down and say “all these treasures around,” you get a closer look. The ground here is rugged rock and black ash and dust and pieces of charred and burnt, petrified wood, and right around the outskirts of where the lava pool is, you can see what look to be broken slivers of soot-covered dragon scale just peppered throughout the landscape. Barely visible until you look real close, thanks to the constant barrage of blacken soot and dust that falls from the nearby area.

LAURA: Do you collect dragon scales for your candles?

CHRIS: Oh, I forgot to tell you. I sold out my own kind because I was enslaved by dragons who had tails who consider themselves royalty and therefore better than me and I don't have a tail. And so I spent my whole life trying to figure out how to turn scales into weaponized candles. Anyway, got to go, everyone have a great time! Thank you!

MATT: You just leave?

CHRIS: I leave! Scoop up some of the few scales and piss off.

MATT: You guys watch as Gern Blanston begins walking around and, like a gutter snipe, or one of the people on the beach with a metal detector, starts combing through.

CHRIS: (singing) Don't you forget about me!

LAURA: Gern! Before you leave!

CHRIS: Aye?

LAURA: You know, we're killing a very, very large dragon, hopefully rather soon.

CHRIS: Very interesting! Where would that be?

LAURA: Well, he's in Emon now, but we're gathering our forces in Whitestone.

CHRIS: Good to know! I might catch up with you later on.

LAURA: All right!

CHRIS: Good-bye!

LAURA: Good-bye!

MATT: Which she says with a strange doppler effect even though he's but 20 feet away from you and has chosen to ignore the rest of your party to go about his business.

CHRIS: It's just like an NPC, just Skyrim.

MATT: As your skeleton's in the background dancing.

CHRIS: There's only one left!

MATT: Yeah, only one left.

TALIESIN: He's freezeframe.

MATT: There's plenty of charred corpses littered all over this mountaintop you could make undead from.

TRAVIS: Does the skeleton go with him, or does it stay?

MATT: It follows him. All right, so the rest of you, what is your next course of action?

LIAM: I sidle up next to my sister and stand there for a moment and deadpan say, boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same. And then I walk away.

(laughter)

TALIESIN: Keyleth, why don't we head home?

MARISHA: Which home?

SAM: How do we do that?

TRAVIS: Whitestone.

LAURA: Can we get to Whitestone, can you bamf us?

MARISHA: I can, yeah.

LAURA: Let's go there and rest up.

LIAM: Yeah.

MARISHA: Hey, thank you guys. Thanks for coming, for helping.

LAURA: Your dad is very noble.

SAM: Your homeland is, you know, I mean, the volcano, the magma, the monsters, the fire torn in the sky, it's lovely. It's charming, really.

MARISHA: Thank you, Scanlan. This isn't my homeland. I appreciate how well you know me after all these years.

SAM: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you lived here.

MARISHA: No, this is the Fire Ashari's camp.

SAM: You're not a Fire Ashari?

MARISHA: I'm an Air Ashari.

LIAM: It's all right, it's only been a couple of years.

SAM: Aren't all Ashari the same?

MARISHA: You know what, Scanlan, that might be the most questions you've ever asked me about myself.

SAM: I don't even know your last name!

MARISHA: I don't have one.

SAM: Hey, what's a hashtag?

LAURA: Hey, Gern! Gern! Gern! Gern!

CHRIS: Hello?

LAURA: Is it just dragon scales, or is it any dragon parts you use?

CHRIS: You know, mainly dragon scales, but I do like to see them blown apart, so that part's merely for pleasure.

TRAVIS: You could give him five pounds of dragon scales.

MARISHA: I pick a tree that's big enough to fit all of our fat faces.

MATT: You already cast Transport via Plants this day, that's how you got here.

MARISHA: Maybe we should rest.

TRAVIS: Do you need me to help you with the tree spell?

LAURA: Maybe we should just sleep here and rest up and spend the night, wake up in the morning, head back to Whitestone.

TALIESIN: He's going to still be there next week, by the way.

MATT: And with that, Vox Machina leaves Gern to his business as they go and camp out at the base of the mountain.

CHRIS: Did someone lose an orb?

MATT: And with that, we're going to finish tonight's game!

(laughter)

CHRIS: Can I say something from this realm?

MATT: Yeah.

CHRIS: I'm delighted. We showed a thing tonight on @Midnight of someone lounge singing Stand By Me to Donald Trump and putting the name Donald in there, so I told everyone, please tweet that to @Wilw, and people are fucking doing it.

TRAVIS: That's amazing.

CHRIS: So, if you find the guy singing a very poor rendition of Stand by Me to Donald Trump, please send it to Wil Wheaton, he'll love it! Favorite thing in the world!

MATT: You heard it, guys. Critters' call to action. Make it happen.

CHRIS: #FeelTheGern.

LIAM: CritterStrong.

SAM: Feel the Gern.

MATT: All right, well, guys. Chris, thank you so much for coming and hanging out with us.

CHRIS: Thank you, this was so much fun!

TALIESIN: A week without crying!

TRAVIS: Feel the Gern!

CHRIS: The best DM in the world! This is a wonderful party, and you're all fantastic. Thank you so much. I'm not even upset that you stole my broom.

LAURA: Don't judge me, Scanlan, you didn't see me do it!

SAM: I didn't! I didn't!

LAURA: Sam's just judging.

SAM: I'm judging you, Laura Bailey.

(laughter)

MATT: There is a definite distinction.

LIAM: Don't worry, everyone will judge you when you take it out and use it for the first time.

SAM: Vex is fine. Laura Bailey? Awful.

TRAVIS: She's wanted to fly so much.

LIAM: Beat him by one.

MATT: Well, thank you all so very much for watching tonight. Hope you enjoyed tonight's episode. We return next Thursday, 7PM Pacific time once again to pick up the next length of Vox Machina's journey. Everyone, show your love on Twitter to Chris, @hardwick. Thank you again for coming and being an amazing wizard for all of us. And is it Thursday yet? See some of you guys tomorrow, and if not, next week.

TRAVIS: Peace out! 

Part I

MATT: Fantastic. Well, cool, guys, then let's go ahead and get this show on the road. So, last we left off, Vox Machina, having to traverse the world in search of artifacts known as the Vestiges of Divergence, ancient items of power used in massive-scale warfare in ancient moments of history, they had acquired one from a sunken temple of the Champion of the Raven Queen, taking the life, and thankfully not permanently, of Vex'ahlia over here. The party then retrieved their first artifact and made their way towards the Pyrah tribe of the Ashari druids, the Fire Guardians of the Gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, which apparently Thordak, the Cinder King, the great red dragon that helms the Chroma Conclave that just tore through all of the civilization of Tal'Dorei, emerged from.

MARISHA: “Apparently.”

MATT: “Apparently.” By that I mean, confirmed, universally, tore through. You guys went there, found a surviving faction of the Pyrah tribe, including Cerkonos, their Headmaster, as well as a few members of your tribe, the Air Ashari, Keyleth. And your father. You went towards the remnants of the Cindergrove, ran into an ally, a strange blue-scaled dragonborn by the name of Gern Blanston, master of necromancy and candle-making and combining the two for interesting effect. You fought your way through the Cindergrove, tearing through elementals, encasing efreets in hamster balls and holding them aloft for extended periods of time. Worked out well. And then managed to seal the Gate with the help of the druidic tribes there, Gern, and the intrepid adventurers of Vox Machina. After which, you went to spend the evening there on the mountainside to rest before continuing your journey to wherever that next step may be. So the rest of you are beaten, bruised, and winded over the previous series of battles and the accomplishment you achieved here at the top of the caldera of this mountain. The erupting, seismic energies and molten rock that once spewed from the center of this rift have calmed, and the gate once again has been sealed to its dormant, controllable, and watchable size. You guys are free to make camp wherever you'd like.

LAURA: We already rested, though?

MATT: Not yet, you're about to set up rest. There are sections, as you're walking out of the Cindergrove, that you can see members of the Pyrah tribe are pulling up still-functional pieces of huts and tents and things that were destroyed when Thordak tore through the rift, and they're beginning to reassemble a place to stay for the evening for themselves, so if you wish to stay among the Pyrah tribe for the evening, it seems to be at least a relatively safe bet.

LAURA: What do you think, Keyleth? I mean, it's your family.

MARISHA: That's up to you guys. I don't think I can transport us out of here until we sleep.

TALIESIN: I have no problem sleeping here this evening.

LAURA: I'm rather winded, actually.

TALIESIN: Yes.

TRAVIS: What are all the tents and houses made of, anyway?

MATT: Most of them are made of pieces of stone. The actual blackened grey rock of this mountain, elements of it have been fused together with bits of glass to forge these thick, very sturdy walls when they aren't being torn through by a colossal red dragon.

TRAVIS: (scoffs) Whatever.

MATT: So they're being brought back up, druids are using what remains of their powers from the fight today to assemble more walls of stone, and they're basically creating ramshackle living spaces using their magic.

MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and assist them, because I didn't use any 5th-level spells.

MATT: All right. So you begin throwing up some stone walls to help build a small shelter for the evening. The rest–

LAURA: Is Gern completely out of the picture, have we lost sight of him?

MATT: You've lost sight of Gern, Gern went back into the Cindergrove and began essentially gutter-sniping what pieces of red dragon scales he could locate in the vicinity. He has not been seen since that moment. Who knows to where he wandered?

SAM: Key-leth? If I may.

MARISHA: Yes, Scan-lan?

LAURA: You said that so weird.

SAM: That's how it's spelled: Key-leth.

MARISHA: So regal of you, Scan-lan.

SAM: Are your people comfortable in these little huts and stuff, are we going to be safe tonight? Because I could assist us with slightly better shelter.

LAURA: Like how, what do you mean?

SAM: With my magical… dalliances.

TRAVIS: Is that another name for your penis?

SAM: It is.

LAURA: Are you going to poop us a bed?

SAM: I could poop us a bed. Are we okay here, safely, or should I get us something special?

TALIESIN: With your dalliance.

SAM: With my dalliance.

TALIESIN: I think your penis may have more names than I do, I'm kind of horrified.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I want a house from your balls and bits.

MARISHA: I mean, my people have lived here for thousands of years.

SAM: Yes, but their shelters are destroyed now, so.

MARISHA: Sure, I mean, generally we're safe as long as dragons aren't smashing through the village, but I mean, if you have an alternative.

SAM: I have an alternative. I could do a bit of dalliancing.

MARISHA: You know, you've talked about it so much now, Scanlan.

TALIESIN: Is this going to be self-dalliance or are you going to need a partner or two?

LAURA: I know, are we just going to watch you diddle yourself? Let's have it.

TRAVIS: Mushroom-stamp the land, let's go.

SAM: No, no, so I will take a minute and cast Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion.

TALIESIN: I am so proud of you. I am so proud of you.

MATT: Okay, so you guys watch as Scanlan rummages through some of his side pouches and belongings, pulls out a few elements, a small doorway carved from ivory. He pulls out a piece of polished marble, a tiny silver spoon, and puts them on the ground in front of him, closes his eyes for a second–

SAM: Can I enchant it with a little song or something?

MATT: Yes you may.

SAM: So I'll sing (singing) It's a sick house, it's mighty mighty, it's letting it all hang– that's it.

MATT: You guys are mildly confused, but as he picks up the items, you can see the door sets off this small spark of white energy that glistens in the air, hovers, and then creates a somewhat shimmering doorway, just standing in the center of the space in front of you.

LAURA: What?

SAM: Would you like to come into my place? It's a little modest shack that I've been working on.

LAURA: Is this a teleport sort of–

TRAVIS: It's a door.

MARISHA: Is this a joke?

TALIESIN: There's nothing on the other side of it, is there?

SAM: No, no, it's a place where we can rest for the evening, totally safe and comfortable. It's on a slightly different plane from ours, so nothing can actually hurt us there or get to us.

LAURA: Is it that fire plane where we just– there's no dragons in that plane?

SAM: I haven't checked in a while. Actually, this is my first time doing this.

TRAVIS: We should send somebody ahead first to check. Vax, are you up to the bit?

LIAM: Am I up to what? What was that, Grog?

SAM: It's totally safe, don't worry, don't worry.

LIAM: As long as you're not going to whip out the cube, then lead the way.

SAM: How many people can fit in there? It's pretty big.

MATT: Any creature you designate when you cast the spell to enter. So you could say the entire Pyrah tribe if you wanted.

LAURA: What?

SAM: Everybody.

MATT: Everybody in the group, or the Pyrah?

SAM: How many are there?

MATT: Here, there's close to 35, including the Zephrah.

LAURA: Wait, could you technically do this with any refugees? I mean, where do they go when you make the door go away?

SAM: This is my place, all right? I don't want any riffraff in there. Listen, there's a guest list, there's a guy at the door–

TALIESIN: I can solve this really quickly. Are any of the Pyrah tribe hot?

LAURA: Like, attractive?

TALIESIN: Attractive.

LAURA: They're all hot.

MATT: Through the soot and ash and the rather somber atmosphere here that paints them as a people that are the survivors of a horrible calamity, beyond that, there's probably a few that you'd consider attractive, sure, if you're that kind of person.

TALIESIN: That one over there was looking at you, I saw her wink at you earlier.

SAM: Oh, really?

TALIESIN: You should impress her.

SAM: The one with her face just sheared off?

TALIESIN: Yeah, why not?

SAM: All right. Not really my type. I like full-faced people, but I'll take it, I'll take my chance.

TALIESIN: I think that's big of you.

LAURA: So terrible.

SAM: You know, if there's anyone from your immediate family that you'd like to give lodging to tonight– okay, we'll take them all, we'll take them all in. We'll take them all in.

MARISHA: Sure. Do you want to tell them? It is your humble abode.

SAM: Ashari people!

MARISHA: All right.

MATT: You see some of them stop and drop the rocks they're currently holding and building some of these small shelters.

SAM: Don't worry about your shelter for tonight. Let Scanlan Shorthalt take care of you, in every way, shape, and form imaginable. Come with me through this weird magic door into another plane. Believe me, it's going to be okay.

MATT: They all look at each other with a strange glance and continue building their current shelters.

LAURA: Why the fuck not? And I walk on through.

MATT: Okay. You open the door, and as you grab it, it is a solid door, and the handle spins, you look inside, and within you see an incredibly lush foyer to a grand mansion, a 25-, 30-foot ceiling made of marble and dark woods, you see a two-part staircase that splits off onto a second-tier floor, you hear soft music playing in the distance, and immediately you see two somewhat ethereal servants come down, dressed as a butler and a maid, they come down, with an echoing voice that say, “How might we be of service?”

LAURA: What the fuck.

SAM: Hi. I step in after her. Yes, I've made some changes to the place. Living quarters are upstairs, there's a kitchen, parlor, game room over there, billiards, all sorts of stuff. We have a music room. There are a hundred attendants who can wait on us. I've assigned some of them specific jobs. Five are going to play music for us wherever we want, especially during our meals.

MATT: “Let me take your things, Master.”

SAM: Oh, yes, yes, here.

TRAVIS: I come inside and I see the ethereal things, I'm like, ghosts! And I take Craven Edge and I swing at the ethereal sumbitch!

SAM: Are you attacking my attendants?

TRAVIS: No, the ghosts in your house!

SAM: They're my people!

TRAVIS: What?

MATT: By the time you go to stop him, three of the servants that have grabbed a few of your belongings and been carrying away, are swung at, Craven Edge passing through, and their energy dispersing, and their contents of whatever they're carrying drop and clink to the ground.

LAURA: No!

SAM: Jesus Christ–

TRAVIS: Thank god I'm here.

SAM: Grog, Grog, easy. Easy. They're not ghosts, they're not ghosts. They are supernatural spirits– some would say ghosts– that are good, they serve us, they serve me–

LAURA: Wait, do you pay them or do they just work for you?

SAM: They're slave ghosts.

LAURA: This is terrible. Scanlan!

SAM: Well, no, they like it for some reason.

LAURA: Are you sure?

SAM: I can command them to do literally anything and they like it.

LAURA: Have you asked them?

SAM: Watch this. Watch this. I call one over. You there, you there.

MATT: This maid comes over, a plumper older woman, no feet, just drifting along with this path of mist behind her. “Yes, Master?”

SAM: Can you please braid my chest hair?

MATT: “But of course, Master.”

SAM: Do you like this job?

MATT: “It is my purpose, Master.”

SAM: See? This is what I'm telling you.

LAURA: Your purpose, do you enjoy your purpose?

MATT: “What does one but enjoy their purpose in life?” And continues braiding his chest hair, these tiny little hairs, doing a very good job. It's not very long, but sure enough, there is a pattern.

LAURA: Wow.

SAM: Thank you, you're dismissed. Back to the music room.

MATT: “Of course, Master.”

LAURA: Do you tip them?

SAM: You can tip me, I'll pass it out later.

LAURA: I believe you.

TRAVIS: Hey, you there, you, ghostie, do you have any ale in this establishment?

MATT: “But of course, sir. We have an entire winery as part of the mansion.”

LAURA: What in the fuck is this place? How are you doing this?

TRAVIS: Bring your most expensive frosty glass of ale.

MATT: “All right.”

LIAM: I pull Scanlan over to the side. Have you always been able to do this? Have you been holding out on us, man?

SAM: It never occurred to me to do this before, for some reason.

TRAVIS: You shouldn't be Burt Reynolds, you should be Hugh Hefner from now on.

SAM: No, this is a skill that I recently acquired. I would not hold out on you. This is a new skill that I've just learned, and I'm still making improvements to the house. You'll see that our dining room has a portrait of myself in it. Not the one that I had commissioned, but one that I had envisioned before. It's just me in a smoking jacket standing in front of a fireplace with me in a smoking jacket above it, Stephen Colbert-style.

TRAVIS: Really?

SAM: And we all have our own separate rooms. All of the beds are circular, they all have a mirror over them.

TRAVIS: Oh my god. It's Graceland!

SAM: Mine is a waterbed, so be careful.

LAURA: So wait, you built this entire castle, so how do we know that you haven't installed creepy spy things into our rooms, Scanlan?

MARISHA: Yeah, little peep holes.

LAURA: I don't trust you.

SAM: On we go to the rest of it!

TRAVIS: I'm waiting on my beer.

TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. Let's get some beer, let's take a rest, and in the morning we can go to the game room, get some dice and some paper–

TRAVIS: A game within a game. The Inception (bass note).

TALIESIN: It's called Meta and Dragons, we're just going to see how deep it goes.

MARISHA: Keyleth just gets a nosebleed for no reason. She's not sure why.

TALIESIN: Had to get that out of my system.

MATT: An ever-spinning top on the banister. At this point, Grog, you can see that the servant you had sent off comes up with a very large, somewhat spectral flagon, that upon handing it to you, turns into a solid metallic form, and inside–

TRAVIS: Holy shit.

MATT: – a very, very finely chilled, very nice-smelling wine.

TRAVIS: I put my hand up for a high-five.

MATT: It makes contact.

TRAVIS: It does?

MATT: A little cushy, but it does make contact, yes.

TRAVIS: Wait, these servants will do whatever you want to do?

LAURA: That is terrible, it's a terrible path you're going down right now, I am uncomfortable with this–

SAM: I am way ahead of you, Grog. I'm way ahead of you. As I said, there are 100 servants here. 50 of them are assigned to me and my own personal service. The rest are available to you in whatever capacity you'd like them.

TRAVIS: This is going to be the best night ever.

MARISHA: Let me go try and gather the rest of the Ashari.

LAURA: So uncomfortable right now.

MARISHA: Can I get a plate of food from one of the ghosts as proof?

TRAVIS: It's about to get Caligula up in this bitch.

MATT: The servants gather up a platter of food, piling up, grapes and meats and cured ham.

MARISHA: I just pop out of the door and address the people.

MATT: As soon as you pop out of the door, it all turns to smoke and dissipates.

MARISHA: Aw, son of a– Hey, guys, hey. It's okay. It's actually really nice. It's been rough, why don't we all take a night off and everyone come in and get some food. Take a night off.

LAURA: Scanlan, where are we staying? Where's our rooms?

SAM: Rooms are all upstairs. There's individual rooms for all of us. Mine is at the end of the hallway, and is slightly bigger than the rest. You will find comfortable beds and things in every room. The two rooms next to mine are reserved–

LAURA: For?

SAM: One is for Pike, the other across the hallway is for Kaylie, just in case she ever drops by.

LAURA: That's really sweet.

TALIESIN: Weird, but sweet.

SAM: Don't worry, it's not weird.

TALIESIN: Oh, it's weird.

SAM: Keeping her close to my heart.

LAURA: It's super-duper weird. It's really weird.

SAM: It's not super-duper– fine, fine, forget it. When you have a daughter, you can worry about her as much as I do.

MATT: At this point, Keyleth returns with a few straggler Pyrah tribal members that come in, looking about, surprised, bewildered, and some of them a little freaked out by this transdimensional space they just stepped into, TARDIS-style. Servants come up and start helping them. Some of them are still clutching the rocks they were building as they pass it off and start making their way out to various rooms to inspect the mansion. A few stay back to continue what they were already building, ensuring future establishments to sleep once you guys have left. So yeah, you guys are welcome to rest for the evening, if you'd like.

LAURA: Is the door protected? Can anybody come in, or is it only if you invite them?

SAM: Only invited.

LAURA: This is the best fucking mansion ever. How– I mean– what?

TRAVIS: How many times can you do this?

SAM: Once a day, but that's all we'll need, right?

TRAVIS: Shit, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, so if we were in a fight and things went really south–

SAM: We could take a break.

LAURA: (gasps) No, but they could run away, it's not like time freezes.

SAM: It does take a while to cast.

MATT: It takes a minute, so yeah.

SAM: It takes a minute to cast.

MARISHA: So it can't be the middle of a battle, sure.

LIAM: Is there anything else you can do that you haven't– can you make an army of unicorns or a giant in a dancing dress, or is this the extent of what you can do?

SAM: I'd like to keep a few secrets, if you don't mind.

TRAVIS: Can you make fart sounds with your armpits?

SAM: Yes. I can bend my thumb all the way back.

LAURA: I pull out my crystal and I call upon the great power of Trinket. I choose you.

MATT: With a flash of deep blue and black light, Trinket emerges (bear noises).

LAURA: We have a mansion! You built a Trinket room.

SAM: You know what, I totally forgot to build Trinket a place to sleep.

LAURA: That's okay, he'll stay in Kaylie's room for the time being, and then–

SAM: No no, Kaylie's room is locked.

LAURA: Pike loves him, I bet he wouldn't mind–

SAM: Let me just think about this for a second. There's the third pantry. The third pantry could possibly work. It has some just mostly– no, no, it's full, we can't use that.

LAURA: Do you have any rooms with very high ceilings?

SAM: The front.

LAURA: The very front?

SAM: The front hall.

LAURA: But I mean somewhere I could put a bed for myself and Trinket with very high ceilings.

SAM: All right, yes, there's a whole basement area. It's a large space.

LAURA: Wonderful. I'll move my bed down there.

SAM: It's for training and working with weapons.

LAURA: That'll be perfect. Trinket needs to train.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go down there and I'll stay with Trinket.

LAURA: All right.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to train a little, want to work out a bit.

LAURA: Totally. I understand.

TRAVIS: Yep. I need a target, though. Hey, can you call one of those little ghostly guys over?

SAM: You can have five of them.

TRAVIS: Yeah, right, fine. The first one of you that brings me a cow wins.

MATT: They all look at each other. “Right away, sir.” And all five of them drift off. A moment later, they all return with a spectral cow.

MARISHA: Like five cows, they each return with one?

MATT: No, each one of them is just traveling with one cow, they've all brought you together one spectral cow.

TRAVIS: It's like a bunch of Mr. Meeseeks with cows. Do I get to pick a cow? There's just one cow?

MATT: There's just one cow.

TRAVIS: Right. So can I touch the cow on the head?

MATT: You touch it, and it has weight to it, it has surface area.

LAURA: No, we're killing cows, we're killing, we're killing poor servants–

TRAVIS: We're not killing anything! And I punch the cow in the nose.

SAM: Jesus!

LAURA: That's so dark!

TRAVIS: No, look, I'm just seeing what it is. Stay, Bessie.

MARISHA: Grog, you just punched a cow in the face.

TRAVIS: What, I'm just seeing if it bled. Did the nose bleed?

MATT: There is no blood.

TRAVIS: I punch it again.

LAURA: Grog! Stop it!

TRAVIS: I took a really easy punch.

LAURA: Look, you're hurting it!

TRAVIS: No, I'm not. Is there any blood?

MATT: No blood.

LAURA: Trinket blocks it.

TRAVIS: Never mind. You know what, I changed my mind, I don't need a cow. I'm going to go stay in a normal room.

LAURA: No, Grog, actually, I think you should train for a little bit at least. Just come down to the basement and maybe train for a little bit.

TRAVIS: All right.

LIAM: I'm sorry, where did that cow come from? I call one of the servants over to me. Can you get anything? Could you get me a small squid?

MATT: They all look at each other and shake their head. “No, sir, we have limited resources here. “The cow, we happened to have one.”

LIAM: Is that a real cow, Scanlan, or was that some sort of ghost cow?

SAM: Ghost cow.

MATT: At which point the cow disperses.

TRAVIS: I punched it so hard it exploded.

TALIESIN: The ghost of a dinner you've already eaten, come back to haunt you.

LAURA: I go down to the training room. And I stop the servant and go, can you bring down a bed for me?

MATT: Yes.

LAURA: Thank you. Grog, can we train, please?

TRAVIS: Yeah. You want to train with me?

LAURA: Yes, I think I need to train with you, specifically.

TRAVIS: All right. Always a good time to get better, I guess.

SAM: What's going on over there?

MARISHA: I don't know.

MATT: You guys walk out of the foyer into the main hallway, and at the end to the left you see a doorway appear where there wasn't one before. It opens up on its own, and as you walk you can see stairs that lead down and into a basement chamber that has a sand pit surrounded by brick. There are a series of wooden training dummies and various training accoutrements. There are chains hanging from the ceiling for lifting and climbing exercises. There is a basic set of weapons against the weapon rack and a basic set of armor on the other set.

SAM: Muscle-ups.

TRAVIS: Rope climbs.

TALIESIN: Are we really about to pretend to do Crossfit? Is that a thing that's actually about to happen?

SAM: Is there a big thing that says WoD on it?

TRAVIS: Wizard of the Day?

LAURA: The minute we get downstairs, I start pawing into the Bag of Holding.

TRAVIS: What are you doing?

LAURA: I just need to (grunts).

(a phone dings)

SAM: Ooh, how did you do that?

TRAVIS: That was awesome.

TRAVIS: What did you grab?

LAURA: Oh, just this cleaning utensil, is all. Are we by ourselves? Nobody else came down, right?

MATT: Just the two of you.

LAURA: Yeah, I just wanted to do some cleaning with this broom that I–

TRAVIS: But this is where you train.

LAURA: I put it in the Bag of Holding before. Maybe you can train over there on those dummies, and I can just sweep up some of this sand that's around in this area right here.

TRAVIS: I thought we were going to train. I thought we were going to fight.

LAURA: Yes. Well, Trinket actually wanted some training with his cannonball. If you will stand still so he can run into you a few times, that would be swell.

TRAVIS: I feel like there's a problem with this idea, but I'm not sure what it is, so I do it.

MATT: Okay. Trinket comes along with you and, in a very confused manner, attempts to train with you for a short time. It's been a while since you wrestled a bear, so it's kind of fun at times.

LAURA: It's fun, right?

TRAVIS: Look, I know I usually hit back, but apparently your mum thinks you can cannonball into me, so give it a go.

LAURA: Go ahead and try, Trinket!

MATT: Trinket backs up (bear growling), looks over at you again like, “Are you sure?” Across the sand flooring into a giant rolling attack towards you.

TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

MATT: That is going to be… What's Trinket's attack bonus?

LAURA: Oh, God, you're really doing it.

TRAVIS: Yes!

LAURA: Yes, that's the point of this, to get Trinket to run into you is the point. His attack bonus is plus eight.

MATT: Plus eight, that's a 23 to hit.

TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

MATT: You go ahead and take seven points of bludgeoning damage.

LAURA: And you're knocked prone!

MATT: Go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay. 26.

MATT: So Trinket rams into you, and you hold firm and flex. Conversely, the giant bear bounces off, stumbles back onto Trinket's butt.

TRAVIS: That was pretty good! I liked it a lot!

MATT: Licks you right along the face, beard cowlicks up a little bit.

TRAVIS: I think this might be a good look for me. How do I get it to stay?

LAURA: While all that is going on, I have a broom in my hand.

MATT: You do.

TRAVIS: I start climbing all over the walls.

LAURA: I put it between my legs and try to sit on it.

MATT: All right.

SAM: Weirdly, I'm doing the same thing upstairs.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Is one of your servants named Broom?

LAURA: And I jump in the air a little bit.

MATT: Hop.

LAURA: Okay. I say, up! Fly! Lift up! Fatty Arbuckle! Shenanigans! Ren and Stimpy, I don't know.

TRAVIS: Rotisserie chicken!

LAURA: Fuck! Grog.

TALIESIN: Perhaps it requires a bad Irish accent.

LAURA: (Irish accent) Fatty Arbuckle!

(laughter)

LAURA: Nothing.

MATT: Nothing.

TRAVIS: Do you usually yell when you clean?

LAURA: (groans) I put the broom on the ground. I walk over and I punch Grog as hard as I can.

TRAVIS: What was that for?

MATT: Grog, it's not very strong.

LAURA: It's not. I'm pretty fucking weak.

TRAVIS: No, I know, but I like to make her feel good about it. Ow!

LAURA: Sorry I hurt you, Grog, I know that was a very strong punch.

TRAVIS: I look at Trinket and wink.

LAURA: Are you guys good? Do you want to keep training?

TRAVIS: Yeah, what are you doing?

LAURA: Nothing! I put the fucking broom back in the Bag of Holding.

TRAVIS: You didn't clean very much.

LAURA: I figured the servants can do it. I walk upstairs.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: Can Scanlan cast Sad Trombone?

SAM: We have a music room. I actually have a trombone.

MATT: That's true.

SAM: (sad trombone sound)

MATT: With Vex not there, Trinket gets a little antsy and eventually your training session with Trinket comes to an end as Trinket goes to seek Vex. You can finish your wall climbing in solace.

TRAVIS: All right. I'm good for the night.

MATT: Okay.

TRAVIS: I wanted that cow.

LAURA: I go find Keyleth.

MARISHA: Okay. I don't know, I'm just chilling. I'm eating food.

TRAVIS: Eating food.

MARISHA: Relaxing.

LAURA: Hey! Actually– no, I don't want to talk to you. Keyleth. What do you know about magical things? Like a lot?

MARISHA: I'm not great at identifying what they are. I can generally be like, that's magical! But I don't know arcane things, only natural-based magics.

LAURA: Oh, fuck. Thank you so much!

MARISHA: Why?

SAM: Anything I can help you with, Vex?

LAURA: Scanlan! I might need to talk to you, dear.

SAM: Should we retire to my room for this?

LAURA: Why, yes, we should.

SAM: (excited gasp) I was not expecting that.

MARISHA: Keyleth just picks up her plate and awkwardly leaves.

LAURA: I go get the broom from the Bag of Holding again.

SAM: I run up to my room to make sure that everything's neat. Light a bunch of candles.

LAURA: I follow him up and knock on the door.

MATT: Okay. The door opens up at the first knock. (creak)

SAM: I'm lying in bed. Black satin sheets. Oh, I forgot you were coming!

LAURA: Wow. Well, darling. I shut the door behind me. I have a favor to ask you.

SAM: I should warn you, we're not alone. And I look over to the five musicians and I ask them to strike up a little–

MATT: A gentle classical piece with a small, low-timbre brass section comes in.

SAM: Little bossa nova.

MATT: Yeah, it's nice. It's not too involved, doesn't distract you too much.

LAURA: It's nice mood setting, I like it.

SAM: Whatever. It's, you know, it's my special place where I like to come and think about philosophy and life.

LAURA: You're so smart. I've always thought that about you, that you're very smart.

SAM: Well, many people do.

LAURA: Yes. I sit down next to him on the bed.

SAM: (gulps) It goes up and down a bit. It's a water bed.

LAURA: Cozy. Help me!

SAM: Is that–

LAURA: What?

SAM: Did we see that before?

LAURA: Maybe. Okay, Scanlan, I'm a terrible person, I know.

SAM: What did you do?

LAURA: I took a broom from a poor, poor dragonborn.

SAM: You took Gern's magical broom?

LAURA: Maybe.

SAM: Oh my gods.

LAURA: I know, I'm sorry, I know, I'm terrible, and now it won't work and it was pointless and I want it to work. Help me.

SAM: Because it flies?

LAURA: Because it flies, Scanlan.

SAM: What is it with you and flying?

LAURA: I don't know, there's just something about being up there in the air that makes me feel alive in a way that I've never felt before.

SAM: I could make you fly.

LAURA: Okay. Wait– Oh, you mean. With your cube.

SAM: Yes, that's right.

LAURA: I'd rather you do it with this broom, actually. And not in any weird way, just to be able to help me make the broom fly. Do you know how to do that?

SAM: I will try. I will examine the broom and make some sort of check on it.

MATT: Make an arcana check.

SAM: Oh, that's not good.

TRAVIS: Should've come to me for that.

LAURA: Oh, no!

TALIESIN: It's a number.

SAM: 14.

MATT: 14. Okay. Looking over the broom, you can tell it's enchanted. There are runes along the sides of the broom. You do gather from the nature of the enchantment that it is an item that requires a spoken phrase from the wielder to initiate its magic. Short of an Identify spell, you would probably have to guess. If you know the Identify spell, that would be a way for you to.

SAM: I don't. Can I examine it to see if there's any markings, any hidden anything on it?

MATT: Make an intelligence check. Or, you know what, this would be specifically investigation. Investigation check.

SAM: Investigation. 21.

MATT: You do notice that many of the runes intricately carved on the side of the broom are– they're part of the enchantment; however, there is a certain phrase that is not part of the enchantment. It's scrawled into and very cleverly hidden amongst the broom. It is not Common. What languages do you know?

SAM: Common, Gnome. Pig Latin.

MATT: It is not a language you recognize.

LAURA: I speak Elvish, Draconic, Undercommon?

SAM: You don't see the words, though.

LAURA: But you saw it.

SAM: There's some words here that might be a clue to the code word. Basically, we need to find the code word. What do we know about Gern?

LAURA: Well, I tried Fatty Arbuckle. I thought maybe that was something.

SAM: Did you try the others? Coral? Carol?

LAURA: Coral. Carol.

SAM: You probably need to hold it.

LAURA: What was the… Oh. Coral! Carol! I don't remember the other one's name.

SAM: I don't either.

LAURA: Stimpy? Was it Stimpy? It was Stimpy!

SAM: Try: On Coral! On Carol! On Stimpy! On Fatty Arbuckle!

LAURA: Wait, but what does the word say? Where's the word?

SAM: I can't read the words.

LAURA: Can I find it? What is it?

MATT: Do you point it out to her?

SAM: I point it out to her.

LAURA: What is it?

MATT: It is Draconic.

LAURA: What does it say?

MATT: It's archaic Draconic. It's from the base root of the language, which is one of the oldest languages in civilization. It spells out, phonetically, the word for candle.

LAURA: That's smart. (hacking spit)

MATT: At which point, the broom jumps up in your hands, and almost lifts you off the bed for a second, and you catch it and hold it back down.

LAURA: (singing) Something has changed within me! Oh my God! Oh my God. Scanlan.

SAM: Weirdly, you are not the first floating chick I've had in my bed. But that is amazing! You're flying!

LAURA: I hug him. I hug him as hard as I've ever hugged Scanlan. I love you so much. You're my favorite person in the entire universe right now. I owe you–

SAM: Nope. You owe me nothing. That's what friends are for.

LAURA: I love you.

SAM: I shake her little elf hand.

MATT: It's a pretty big elf hand compared to your tiny gnome hand.

SAM: Okay.

LAURA: I sit on it. How high are the ceilings in here?

MATT: How high are the ceilings in your room?

SAM: As high as they can be on the top floor.

MATT: For this room, because it is an extradimensional space, this room is probably a good 50 feet high. High ceilings, with drapery. It's so garish.

LAURA: Can I sit side-saddle on it?

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: (hacking spit) I don't remember how I said it before.

SAM: You're going to have to remember that now.

MATT: Better write that down. (hacking spit)

LAURA: Why didn't I choose something more fun to say?

MATT: Welcome to D&D. As the words emit from your mouth, the broom takes off, and you have to aim it a bit. You start going around in circles, slowly rising up towards the roof of the room.

LAURA: Yay, this is awesome! I'm really high!

SAM: I instruct the band to start playing Flight of the Bumblebee.

MATT: (whistling)

LAURA: Oh my gosh! Can I take my hands off?

MATT: You do, and you start going, “Whoa!” Go ahead and make a dexterity check.

LAURA: Oh my God. I probably should have been lower to the ground when I said that. Okay, that's fine. Oh, I'm still exhausted!

MATT: Yep.

SAM: Oh, shit.

LAURA: 20.

MATT: That's fine. You're fine. A really bad roll might have had a circumstance, but you manage to catch yourself on the broom in time and, okay. You're getting the hang of it. It's still not something you're used to, but it's fine.

LAURA: Can I point it down towards the ground and get lower?

MATT: You do. And you take a few minutes to figure out the pitch and wobble of it, and it's less of a directional flight, more than it is a combination of how you hold the front of the broom and concentrate on its direction. But nevertheless, a few moments pass, and you get the hang of it.

LAURA: Oh. My. God. This is the best day of my entire life.

SAM: You look great up there.

LAURA: Thank you. Thank you.

SAM: But you should not have stolen that!

LAURA: Oh, I know, I know, it's terrible!

SAM: He was our friend! He helped us!

LAURA: How bad of a person am I? I'm a horrible person!

SAM: We should do something to repay the debt!

LAURA: Well, I tried. I was going to give him a lot of dragon scales, and he wandered away!

SAM: We can't possibly find him now.

LAURA: Well, how do I help him? Because I feel terrible.

SAM: If we can't help him, you're going to have to help someone else to make up for the lost karma.

LAURA: I will help as many people as I can while I'm flying through the air.

SAM: Perhaps I will pick someone for you to help someday. To repay us both.

LAURA: I think that's a deal, Scanlan.

SAM: All right. I will mark that down.

LAURA: What are you, like, a hag now? I sit on it, and I open the door, and I fly through the doorway.

MATT: She drifts out of the room. The door (slam) shuts behind her.

MARISHA: You're going to be one of those Segway assholes now!

TRAVIS: Yes, totally!

MATT: You lean back in your bed, on your fine, black silken sheets, with Flight of the Bumblebees still blaring by the fireplace.

SAM: All right, guys, it didn't work, you can go.

MATT: They all get up. The music stops. And they all slowly drift out of the room, one by one. Fireplace still crackling.

SAM: It's nice in here.

TALIESIN: I'm sitting wherever there's a lounge of any kind. I'm working in the sketchbook. Working on things.

MATT: Not a worry.

MARISHA: I'll be reading my alchemy book, because I have had so little time to catch up on my reading.

TALIESIN: We never talk anymore, do we?

MARISHA: We never do.

TALIESIN: Mmm.

LAURA: I'm so happy! It's the best!

MATT: So good!

LAURA: I'm going to try to sleep. It's going to be really, really hard because I'm so excited, but I really need to get some rest!

MARISHA: Did you feed the dog?

TALIESIN: Today? I don't know.

MATT: So, anyone want to do anything else? You going to go rest for the evening?

TRAVIS: I rest.

TALIESIN: I'm good.

MATT: All right. You all eventually find your ways to your rooms, happy and comfortable in the fact that no one has to take watch for this night. As you all get to bed, a few hours into the evening, Keyleth, you are just starting to doze off when you hear a knock at the door.

MARISHA: (gasps awake) Scanlan?

MATT: You open the door?

MARISHA: On my door?

MATT: On your door.

MARISHA: Who is it?

MATT: “Keyleth, it is Cerkonos. Please open up. I wish to speak with you.”

MARISHA: I open the door.

MATT: Okay. Cerkonos comes in. The first thing you notice– previously, you had seen what was his burned-off arm at the shoulder. You can now see the flesh is extended and is currently very slowly in the process of regenerating his lost arm. And it catches you off-guard for a moment, and he puts his hand up and says, “Sorry, it is not very presentable.” And he still keeps his hand over it, slightly embarrassed by the mid-regenerative state of it. “I'm sorry to have disturbed you, I come as unease has taken my mind.” And he enters the room and closes the door behind him. “May we sit?”

MARISHA: Of course, please, Cerkonos.

MATT: He goes over and takes one of the nearby chairs and sets it down, places one across from him for you to sit, gestures with his one arm. Sits down. “I would not speak with those I do not trust. And I have seen your purity of soul, Keyleth. So I come to you with these concerns.” His eyes trail off for a moment in the distance, and he gathers his thoughts and his words. “Four years ago, a young woman came to Pyrah for redemption. A lost girl, cast out and wishing for acceptance. We, as we do with outcasts, took her in, taught her. And in time, called her one of our own, one of the Pyrah. In recent months, she began to grow distant, taking to staying in the Cindergrove unattended for days at a time. One afternoon, the mountain moved, angry with shifting fires. We felt a disturbance in the Gate, and when we went to investigate, there she was, commanding powers we did not know she had.”

MARISHA: What kind of powers? Beyond those of druidic nature?

MATT: “These were the magics taken by man who defied the gods. These were the purest of ancient arcane threads. We watched as she reached out and tore open the Gate. She laughed as we called out to stop. But something terrible emerged from that wounded sky.”

MARISHA: Thordak?

MATT: “This dragon you speak of, yes. I defended all that I could, but the power was too great, and unconsciousness took me. I awoke to my people in tatters, the fires untethered, and this terrible girl gone. It is both embarrassing and greatly alarming that we could be infiltrated by such an entity. That blame falls on me, as the headmaster, for not seeing this earlier.”

MARISHA: You acted within the good nature of our people, there's nothing wrong with that. How old was this girl when she came to you? And how old is she now?

MATT: “When she came to us she couldn't be more than 15.”

MARISHA: So she's 19, 20?

MATT: “Perhaps. She did not seem to blossom into womanhood as many do. We considered her more of a runt of her litter, if you will.”

MARISHA: And what was her race?

MATT: “She seemed human.”

MARISHA: She seemed human? What do you mean?

MATT: “We take many forms as druids. If she was indeed human, at that age, to command such power… I do not know her true nature.”

MARISHA: What was her name?

MATT: “Her name was Raishan. Anyway. I wish to tell you this because my heart is heavy with guilt, and I want you to know that even in places of comfort, family, be careful, keep those you know you can trust close. Be mindful of those that promise aid when they have not proven themselves. If you have an instinct, follow it.”

MARISHA: Are you referring to something in particular, Cerkonos?

MATT: “I just do not wish you to make the same mistake I did. Anyway, I thank you for your companions and you coming to our aid. It shall not be forgotten.”

MARISHA: I shall keep an ear open for the name Raishan. If I hear anything about her, I'll send word.

MATT: “Should you need the aid of the Pyrah, though we are not much at now, come find me. I look forward for to you bringing Zephrah together. You will make a fine leader.”

MARISHA: Thank you, Cerkonos. And I'm glad that you're still with us.

MATT: “Kaitiakè, Keyleth.”

MARISHA: Kaitiakè, Cerkonos.

MATT: Cerkonos leaves.

MARISHA: And I start poring through my notes for the name Raishan, because Keyleth believes she has heard that name before as one of the dragons, correct? One of the white–

LAURA: (whispering) It's the green one.

MARISHA: –the green one. Okay, okay.

MATT: That is true.

MARISHA: Do I have any other reference, would I know anything else about that?

MATT: That's all you know, is the name Raishan was used when the Conclave attacked Emon. And it seemed the name belonged to the green dragon that initiated the assault where you guys were.

MARISHA: Fucking bitch.

MATT: So, these thoughts echoing through your mind–

TALIESIN: Streets will run green with revenge!

MARISHA: Yes, they will!

MATT: You sleep, but uneasily, as all of these realizations swirl in your head. Eventually sleep takes you, but it is not an easy sleep. Just enough to function. Barely. Vax. As you yourself have attempted to stave off sleep for many days, pushing yourself to your limits, it finally takes its toll, and you drift off into a deep, deep slumber. In that slumber, you find yourself in darkness. Echoes of a distant voice, muffled, as if underwater. Crash. The darkness is shattered into a thousand black feathers, and you find yourself falling, falling. Falling towards what seems to be a tangled net of glowing threads. You're afraid you might impact at such a speed, but before you do, you slow and come to a stop before this extremely prominent glowing weave, this infinite tapestry in all directions. You are uncertain of the meaning of this moment when a large cold hand reaches past your shoulder and grasps a thread right before your face, this singular glowing thread, pulsing with light like a heartbeat. You follow the arm over your shoulder, and glance up directly into the massive form of the Raven Queen: porcelain face like a mask, long jet-black hair, her body encasing you like a physical cage. Your eyes follow the arm back to the thread that she carries between her massive fingers. She tugs it, ever so gently, and it causes waves to ripple through the tapestry into infinity. Her voice fills your mind, both calm but cold. “This is you, my champion. You are fate-touched. The choice is yours. Rebirth or ruin. Maker or martyr. Conqueror, tyrant, or nothing.” She plucks the thread from the weave, snapping it. You plummet into the hole left behind it, falling faster and faster into the dark. Losing control, you turn around and see the Raven Queen, disappearing into the distance, growing smaller and smaller, until suddenly, nothing. Grog. You fall into a deep snore, heavy, heavy snore, after drinking the wine, climbing up walls, you've had an exhausting day of–

TRAVIS: Sleeping in the sand pit.

MATT: Okay, you are face down.

TRAVIS: Like a beach, just (snore).

MATT: It's great. You've drooled into the sand, and it's clustered around your beard. It's horrifying. But in the middle of snoring, this restful sleep also comes into your mind, and you find yourself walking alone. A long hallway, into blinding light. You have to cover your face, it's so bright, but you push forward because you know there's only one way to go. You cannot see, but you can hear around you and sense the hallway's ended, and there's now space around you. You cannot see, but you sense an arena, gladiatorial in nature. You can hear the distant whisper and hum of crowds cheering.

SAM: Phillip! Phillip!

MATT: You sense others around you, closing in suddenly. A voice, ever-whispering in your ear, says, “Release me.” Still blinded, eyes closed, on instinct, you pull the cold, dark blade from your back and swing wide, over and over again, feeling the shuddering shock of each impact, your strength matched by the razor-like edge of your weapon, cleaving down any who would approach. The high of adrenaline is incredible, and you laugh aloud at the sheer thrill of your own power.

TRAVIS: (laughs triumphantly)

MATT: The light subsides and your vision returns. You look to see hundreds of people dead at your feet. Farmers, children. You see Pike, motionless, cast among the carnage. You want to scream, but instead you laugh, against your own judgment and intent, like you're locked within yourself and have no control. And as you look up from the pile of corpses at your feet, you see a towering figure before you, cast in furs and bone, standing even a head and a half's height above you, is Kevdak, looking down at you with pride. The entire herd steps up beside him, staring at you atop your throne of corpses, and the herd kneels. Kevdak bows, looking up at you, smiling. “You. You have finally made me proud, Grog.” You wake up (gasp), spittle and sand and grit mashed against your face. Who knows how long it's been, but it's been a while since you've had a dream, let alone one like that. Now, as you all eventually come to in the morning, having your evening's rest, you've recovered your hit points, your spells, all of the usual good stuff, in a fantastic mansion. Maybe not the most fantastic rest for some of you, but a fantastic mansion. You all eventually find your way to the breakfast nook, which is as extravagant as you would imagine a Scanlan-based breakfast nook would be.

TALIESIN: Green marble, silver tiling. Sorry, carry on.

MARISHA: Crystal chandelier.

SAM: Waffle presses.

MATT: There's a fantastic breakfast feast already prepared, rows of servants along the walls waiting eagerly to attend to you guys as you sit down, pouring fresh juices. It smells fantastic, and most of you look rested, except for a handful.

SAM: Eat! Drink!

LAURA: I come skipping into the room, for sure.

TALIESIN: Good morning.

SAM: You're looking delighted and delightful.

LAURA: What a beautiful day it is!

MARISHA: Do you have wine and ale at the breakfast buffet?

SAM: Sure, sure. There's mimosas, there's–

MARISHA: I'll have a mimosa.

TALIESIN: You've never heard of breakfast beer?

SAM: Breakfast beer? Sure. There's milk from a cow with a broken nose.

LAURA: Oh, that is so sad. Can you heal it? Can it be healed?

SAM: It'll be fine. When we leave this place, all these people die, anyway.

TALIESIN: You're supposed to churn the milk after it leaves the cow.

LAURA: Wait, Scanlan, can we store things here, or does it all disappear as soon as we leave?

SAM: I don't know.

MATT: You haven't tried it before.

LAURA: We should leave something inconsequential.

SAM: We'll leave Trinket, and then we'll try it again, and if Trinket's still here, we'll know.

MARISHA: Schrödinger's Trinket.

SAM: It's just– no?

LAURA: No.

SAM: All right. We'll leave the broom and see if it's still here.

LAURA: No, no, no, let's not.

TALIESIN: What broom?

SAM: Oh, Vex, is there something you'd like to admit to the rest of the group? They'll see you use it sooner or later.

MATT: You hear a voice go (grunt). Trinket's over there, face covered in breakfast food, trying to sit at one of the edges of the table like a person, the actual bowing of the wooden bench that Trinket's on, you hear the creaking as he moves around in it.

LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan, for making me feel… So, guess what! I can fly! A-plus!

TALIESIN: How did that happen?

MARISHA: I had a really weird night, too. What happened in your… because, I mean, flight?

LAURA: Did you have a weird night? Do you want to tell us about it?

MARISHA: No, I want to hear about your night.

TALIESIN: I think you go first.

MARISHA: I want to learn how you fly.

LAURA: Okay. So I sort of kind of tricked Gern, I'm a terrible person.

SAM: Gern, our friend.

TRAVIS: You swallowed that last part. What did you say?

LAURA: I sort of kind of, this is the worst… took something that wasn't mine? In a way. I mean, I was holding on to it, and then I slipped, and it fell into the Bag of Holding.

TRAVIS: Why is that bad?

TALIESIN: You stole from a candlemaker?

LAURA: I stole from a necromancer.

TALIESIN: Slash candlemaker.

LAURA: Yes. No, he was a nice guy.

SAM: I think we should hear Vax's opinion of this.

MARISHA: Vax, I think you were a bad influence.

LIAM: I can't judge. I've done my share in the past. I thought you were a little overly nice to him.

TALIESIN: I mean, to be fair, we did steal a carpet once.

LAURA: We did.

SAM: Did we steal that? I thought it was just a–

MARISHA: We used that in an emergency.

TRAVIS: We commandeered it.

LAURA: We took it, Scanlan, and we didn't tell Allura.

TALIESIN: And then never gave it back.

SAM: That's true.

LAURA: We're terrible.

LIAM: I don't think any of us can judge you, Vex'ahlia, but it does strike me as a little bit odd, if nothing else.

LAURA: I know. I know, I'm afraid these rogue tendencies I've been learning from you, brother, maybe rubbed off a little bit. No, I just, I know I shouldn't have.

TRAVIS: I don't care.

LAURA: I wanted to return it right away, and then he wandered off. That's a lie, I didn't want to return it. But I did want to pay him!

TRAVIS: I don't think you wanted to do that either.

LAURA: No, I did! I did, I wanted to pay him! But he wandered away, and then I didn't pay him, and now I have this broom that I stole, and there's really no way to return it. Well, I probably could find him, but I don't want to because now I can fly, you guys.

TRAVIS: Are you going to re-gift it?

LAURA: No. I'm going to keep it.

MARISHA: What do you say, Percy? I think it's kind of funny.

TALIESIN: Are you honestly asking my opinion? You said what?

LAURA: Actually, Percy, do you know– I know you can build things and make things wonderful.

TALIESIN: Can you show me? What is this thing, what did you steal? What is this thing?

LAURA: I pull out the broom and I lift up in the air.

MATT: You guys watch as Vex all of a sudden (whoosh) takes off above the breakfast room.

TRAVIS: Sweet!

MARISHA: All right, that is pretty cool, Vex. That's pretty badass.

TALIESIN: I don't know if I approve of the metaphor, but that's–

LIAM: What happens when you shoot a couple arrows from up there?

TRAVIS: Yeah, shoot me with an arrow!

MARISHA: Yeah, shoot some arrows!

TALIESIN: Okay, you're not holding onto the broom anymore.

LAURA: No, I've been practicing! I've been practicing!

MARISHA: I reach on the table and I grab what I'm sure is a whole chicken sitting there.

SAM: Sure.

MARISHA: And I hold it up and I go–

TALIESIN: Has it not occurred to you that you're not going to be able to fly?

LAURA: No, no, no, look! I'm not holding on, Percy! Look at me, not holding on!

MARISHA: Okay, Vex, ready? Ready, Vex? Vex?

TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

MARISHA: Trust.

SAM: Watch your eyes. Watch your eyes.

MARISHA: Trust Vex!

MATT: All right, Laura, I want you to go ahead and, first, roll a dexterity check.

LAURA: Okay. Shut up! 13.

MATT: 13, okay. You almost slip off the broom in the process of drawing the arrow from the quiver. You catch yourself and just barely manage to pull back and fire. I want you to go ahead and roll an attack with disadvantage.

LAURA: Oh, man, disadvantage. Okay.

MARISHA: Please, god, may your aim be true today, Vex.

LAURA: 16.

MATT: 16. (impact) The arrow does get relatively close to your hand, but it does stick into the turkey.

MARISHA: She did it! I hand the chicken to Scanlan.

SAM: I start eating.

TALIESIN: I pull the arrow out of the chicken.

LIAM: Do it again! And I throw the chicken closest to me into the air.

LAURA: Oh, shit.

SAM: A moving target!

LAURA: Oh, god, okay.

MATT: Okay, make another dexterity check.

LAURA: Okay.

SAM: There's lots of chickens, by the way.

LAURA: Shit balls. 13.

MATT: 13. Okay, this time, you start falling off and you catch yourself entirely. The arrow just goes wide, you don't even get a chance to nock it in the bow.

LAURA: Mother bitch, I really need to work on this! Okay.

MARISHA: It'll take some practice.

TALIESIN: I don't think this is– this may be an engineering issue.

LAURA: Yes, Percy, this is the thing. Can you build a seat on this?

TALIESIN: I pull out my notepad and start sketching.

LAURA: What if you could build a seat, and then I can sit on it instead of trying to sit on this tiny little stick?

TALIESIN: Let me–

SAM: Tinker?

TALIESIN: Tinker.

MARISHA: You know, beyond it being an engineering issue, it might be a greed issue first.

LAURA: Really?

MARISHA: Look–

LAURA: How's that mimosa treating you?

MARISHA: It's phenomenal. It's been a long few weeks. I don't care. I don't care. We're never going to see Gern again. I have so many other things to care about.

SAM: Oh, no, she's day drunk again.

LAURA: Oh, no, are you already drunk, Keyleth?

MARISHA: No! I'm just, it's been a long few– Look.

TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus!

MARISHA: I don't care anymore.

TRAVIS: How many was that? Just one, right? We've been here for five minutes.

LAURA: I float down.

MARISHA: No! I just don't want you to die.

LAURA: I float down eye-level, but I'm still floating.

MARISHA: I don't want you to die. I don't want you to die because of your greed. I don't care that you have– You look amazing. Doesn't she look amazing?

TALIESIN: Like a real hoverboard, is there a chance this one might set on fire as well?

LAURA: Why are you trying to be an asshole?

TALIESIN: Sorry.

LAURA: Here's the thing, Keyleth. I'm not afraid to die anymore. I came to this realization. I've seen the other side. I've come to terms with it.

MARISHA: Well, that's phenomenal that you've come to terms with it! I don't know about the rest of us in the room that all watched you die, though.

TALIESIN: I feel too guilty to say no to her. I'm perfectly content to let this go.

TRAVIS: It is pretty sweet, flying around like that.

LAURA: It's pretty wonderful.

MARISHA: It's really cool.

TALIESIN: She's an adult. Deep levels of arrested development, but an adult nonetheless.

MARISHA: I don't care about the broom.

SAM: Keyleth, Vex swore to me that she would only use it for good.

LAURA: That's right. I'm not going to steal anything while I'm riding on it.

TALIESIN: Where would you put it, anyway? You can't let go.

MARISHA: Just don't get into trouble, I guess.

LAURA: I'll practice as much as I can, and Percy's going to help me.

TALIESIN: Yes.

LAURA: So I can be stable on this thing.

TALIESIN: I may need some money, but we'll put something together.

LAURA: I will give you all the money you want.

LIAM: Are you going to carry that on your back?

LAURA: Maybe.

LIAM: You'll look like a Byroden chimney sweep.

LAURA: But I feel so good.

MARISHA: You got out, you came out on top this time. It might not happen next time.

LAURA: I start eating while sitting on the broom.

MARISHA: All right. I think she's listening to me.

SAM: I think you broke through.

MARISHA: I think I did.

TALIESIN: I think you're learning to let people be people.

MARISHA: I don't care anymore.

SAM: Oh, look, look! Another round of chickens has just arrived for us to eat.

MARISHA: Oh, chicken!

SAM: I don't know what breakfast is, so I just keep commanding them to make chickens.

MATT: So much chicken, guys.

LAURA: Where should we head to?

SAM: What is our next– Shoot, I kept a to-do list for us, but I didn't bring it tonight.

TRAVIS: (burps)

SAM: Oh. I thought you were going to say something. That was a belch?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: Did you want to head back to– Actually, Keyleth, you said something weird happened last night for you as well.

MARISHA: Yeah. Cerkonos stopped by.

LAURA: Yeah? I look at my brother. All right, cool. Keep going.

MARISHA: Not… As my elder. He stopped by as my respected elder. Do you all remember the name Raishan?

TALIESIN: Yes.

LAURA: That's one of the dragons.

MARISHA: Apparently she's our little infiltrator.

LAURA: What do you mean?

MARISHA: She came to the Fire Ashari, she came to Pyrah, about four years ago, and the Ashari, being the adoptive people that we are, they took her in.

LAURA: They adopted a dragon?

MARISHA: They adopted a dragon.

LAURA: How?

TALIESIN: Do they think she's the one who sabotaged the rift?

MARISHA: They do. They were unaware that she was a dragon.

SAM: Does that make her the leader or something? Is that how all the dragons got through? I'm still not quite sure.

TALIESIN: It makes her the instigator, at the very least.

MARISHA: It makes her fairly close to Thordak, it would seem. Apparently, when she came to the Fire Ashari, she was about 15 years old, and…

SAM: As a dragon?

TALIESIN: Visually.

MARISHA: As a human woman.

LAURA: So she was making it seem like she was 15.

MARISHA: She was making it seem like she was 15, and they started realizing that she possessed powers far beyond anything that they had seen before, and then these powers began to exceed anything beyond our druidic capabilities. And it would seem that they realized that too late.

SAM: Did they say anything about her goals, or motivations? Her ambitions?

MARISHA: Cerkonos said one day they woke up and the mountain was spewing fire, and was angry with lava, and when he went to investigate it, she was there, ripping open the rift. And that was when everything happened. When he came to consciousness, everything was destroyed, so that's all he saw. And she was gone. But we know where she went next.

TRAVIS: Where?

SAM: To Emon.

LAURA: Oh, eventually.

SAM: Kill everybody.

LAURA: Right. Totally. That day. The day.

MARISHA: I was trying to skip exposition, I thought you guys could fill in the blanks.

TALIESIN: We thought you had new information beyond that and would maybe want to add. It was certainly set up that way.

MARISHA: Thank you. I'll work on that next time.

TALIESIN: It was very leading.

LAURA: Okay, well that's good to know.

SAM: So perhaps we should inquire if you think this– Raishan?

MARISHA: Raishan.

SAM: Has tried to pretend to be a human woman in any other place? Should we ask around, or was it

just the one ruse here to gain entry for her companions?

MARISHA: I'm not sure.

SAM: All right. Well, don't trust anyone.

MARISHA: Don't trust anyone.

LAURA: Got it.

MATT: Servant rushes forward, “More chicken, sir?”

SAM: Keep it coming.

MATT: “Right away.”

LAURA: Do you guys have vegetables, maybe? Any vegetables?

MATT: “Vegetables, sir?”

SAM: I forgot to tell them to make them. Sorry. It's all chicken.

MATT: “Chicken it is.”

LAURA: Cool. Chicken and mimosas, it's my favorite breakfast.

MARISHA: And waffles.

SAM: Oh, waffles too? Chicken and waffles, that's right. Maybe someone else should be in charge of the food next time we come here. My tastes are a little–

TALIESIN: Base?

LAURA: Little?

SAM: Singular.

MARISHA: And one thing that this does confirm is that this has been a plan that's been in the process for a very, very long time.

SAM: No, I just came up with the chicken this morning when I woke up.

LAURA: Where are we going next, you guys?

SAM: Grog had some brass knuckles to get. Was that a thing? Did we get those?

TRAVIS: No. We haven't gotten those yet. But there's other things to explore.

SAM: All right. Wait, did we have to go make a trip to anyone else's homeland? How's Whitestone?

LAURA: We need to talk to a sphinx. A sphinx's boyfriend.

SAM: Oh, that's right. Maybe that should be our next–

MARISHA: What was his name? Hang on.

SAM: And what were we trying to get there? Another one of the articles of confederation?

MARISHA: We need the Titanstone Knuckles of Kord, which Kevdak has.

TRAVIS: Yep.

LAURA: That's with your tribe.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

SAM: Okay, but then there's the sphinx.

LIAM: Time for a family reunion, Grog.

SAM: What's that, Vax?

LIAM: I said it's time for a family reunion, Grog. Are you ready for that, or do you want to put that off a bit?

TRAVIS: Oh, no, I mean. Whenever. It's. You know.

LAURA: So do you want to go now, or do you want to maybe swing by somewhere?

TALIESIN: It's either that or the library, I imagine.

TRAVIS: You want to go to the library?

TALIESIN: I was just saying that it's either that or the library.

SAM: So it's Grog's herd or the sphinx to get something.

LAURA: We'll remember.

SAM: On the way. And then, or, TBD, find something else to do. I guess Grog's thing is the most promising. We know that there's Knuckles there, we know that there's people we'll know there.

LAURA: Well, it's all actually around Westruun, right? Aren't your people around Westruun?

TRAVIS: You know, they roam.

LAURA: So we have to find them.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: Last time we ran into them, wasn't it on the way to Kraghammer?

TALIESIN: From Westruun.

MARISHA: Odessa's mate is south of the Frostweald.

LAURA: I think it was.

TRAVIS: Was it?

LIAM: Yeah, it was. On the way to Kraghammer, that's right.

SAM: Is Frostweald near Kraghammer as well?

LAURA: The Frostweald is–

MATT: South of Westruun.

LAURA: South of Westruun, yes.

TALIESIN: So let's make our way to Westruun, I suppose, then.

SAM: And that's in the direction of both Grog's herd and the Frostweald?

LAURA: Potentially? Well, Grog would know.

TRAVIS: What?

LAURA: Cool. Yes, I think Grog really wants to go.

SAM: Yeah, we should probably go there.

LAURA: Yeah.

SAM: Let's do that.

MATT: Your herd wanders all across the Silvercut Roadway, that whole area to the west of Westruun, south of Kraghammer, east of Emon, that vicinity.

TRAVIS: They wander there.

LAURA: Around there.

TRAVIS: Yep.

LAURA: Okay.

TRAVIS: But look, I was thinking. It might be a thing when we find them, right? So picture this. Me, and then a lot of other me's, and they're all really big and angry. So if we want to do anything else before that happens–

SAM: You think they'll attack us? But we're with you! You're our ally!

TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'm a super cool, awesome, fun guy, but we didn't really leave in the best terms.

LAURA: Oh, weren't you–

TRAVIS: Ass-kicked, yeah. All left for dead, pretty much.

MARISHA: You know what, Grog, it's been a while. Why exactly were you beat up and kicked out of your herd?

TRAVIS: Right, so I was a bit younger, and we were wandering through the woods, and we came upon this little old bearded thing, right? And he was carrying groceries, like food and stuff, and everybody was a little hammered from boozing, and they were like, hey, let's kill the little thing, and we'll string him up and see what his insides look like! And normally I'm like, yay, I'll wear him as a hat! But he looked really sweet, and I felt bad, so I said we shouldn't do that. And… They didn't like that answer. My uncle in particular, he didn't like that, so he made me fight my cousin, his son.

LAURA: And?

TRAVIS: That wasn't bad, I handled that. It was not a problem.

MARISHA: Okay. So they might have a grudge about that.

TRAVIS: No, there's no grudge. They pretty much think I'm dead, because after I whooped his son's ass, he whooped my ass.

LAURA: Oh.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

TALIESIN: We have a thing for that.

SAM: We do?

TALIESIN: Can I borrow your hat?

SAM: Of course you can borrow my hat.

LAURA: The Hat of Disguise?

TALIESIN: If you don't want to have an immediate confrontation with your family, there's no particular reason why they have to know you're alive yet at all.

SAM: You could wear this hat. Might not fit on your head, you could maybe put it on one of your knuckles.

TRAVIS: I'm not hiding from my herd.

TALIESIN: You were giving off the impression of one who is looking forward to putting something off.

TRAVIS: I was, was I?

TALIESIN: You were. You're not anymore, as if you've been dared, somehow.

LAURA: Very big.

SAM: If you're too scared to do it, we can go elsewhere. Sorry, I will never say that again.

TRAVIS: No, I'm excited to go. I want to go. We should go. You know, what we need is the wolf.

LAURA: The wolf?

TRAVIS: Yeah. We need–

LAURA: Oh, the wolf in Whitestone?

TRAVIS: Yeah. Don't they smell shit? He could help us find them.

LAURA: Well, Trinket can smell.

MARISHA: And I can also theoretically turn into a wolf to help us find things.

TRAVIS: I mean, if you want to. I don't know how long it's been since he's seen a she-wolf, so, you know.

LIAM: Grog.

MARISHA: I was talking as in–

TRAVIS: I mean, it's very generous.

LIAM: Just out of curiosity, we weren't going to walk in and negotiate with your uncle. He's not going to give us these Knuckles. He's a proud owner of them, yes?

TRAVIS: Yep.

LIAM: And how many are in the herd, roughly?

TRAVIS: What's a number bigger than five?

LAURA: Six?

TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like six.

MARISHA: You mean it's like at least six? Or possibly more than six? How fast actually is the reproduction process of goliaths?

TALIESIN: Are there more people in your herd or fingers on your hand?

LIAM: I hold up Scanlan's hands and then I hold up my hands behind them so that all 20 fingers are waggling. Grog, are there more than this many in your herd?

TRAVIS: Yeah, six.

LAURA: Okay.

TALIESIN: He's counting hands, not fingers.

LAURA: Oh. I hold up mine, too.

SAM: We all hold up our hands.

LAURA: How many hands is that?

LIAM: We're doing rakshasa hands. Grog, is there more of them than rakshasa hands?

TRAVIS: That's closer, yeah. It's been a long time.

MARISHA: Yeah, this could be bad. This could be bad.

TALIESIN: We could attempt to steal them.

LAURA: Steal from the goliaths? That could work.

MARISHA: How easy is that?

LAURA: Does he wear them all the time? Does he put them in a chest?

TRAVIS: I mean, they're pretty smart, they're like me.

LAURA: Yeah. You're right.

LIAM: I don't think it's going to be pretty no matter what we do, but I actually think trying to steal them might be a better angle than going toe-to-toe with “six” goliaths. I just did air quotes.

LAURA: If six is the right number.

TRAVIS: Here's the thing, though. Normally, if you try and steal something, or if you try and break the rules and you're like Keyleth and you get arrested every time, arrested ain't so bad. They don't really arrest you. They, like, open you up and use you as an appetizer.

LAURA: As a hat.

TRAVIS: Yeah. That was my thing, though. So I'm a little nervous about that.

LIAM: We just have to pick the least terrible option right now.

MARISHA: Well, we need these vestiges. We cannot do anything without these vestiges.

SAM: It seems to me that no matter where we go, we are putting ourselves in peril.

TRAVIS: Yep.

SAM: So it's really just a question of which peril do we want to face first.

MARISHA: And don't we theoretically need the vestiges before we go visit Odessa's boyfriend?

SAM: I thought Odessa's boyfriend had a vestige.

LAURA: No, he has locations of other vestiges.

TRAVIS: Odessa? Osysa.

MATT: Osysa.

MARISHA: Sorry.

TRAVIS: Shit, that's what I would call her. Odessa.

LAURA: I feel like Pike would want to come with us, Grog. You're very dear to her.

MARISHA: But wasn't Pike and her grandfather the reason?

TRAVIS: It was Pike's grandfather, yeah. And plus, she's a healer.

TALIESIN: At the very least, let's make our way to Westruun, then. Let's get that far and see what's–

MARISHA: Well, remember Westruun is under dragons right now.

SAM: We can instantly transport anywhere.

LAURA: You know of trees outside of Westruun?

MARISHA: I can, but it's under dragon reign. In fact, isn't that where Raishan stopped off?

MATT: No, the scrying that you saw was Umbrasyl, the black dragon, that took up residence, it seems, in Gatshadow, the mountain north of Westruun, at the base of the Cloudkeep mountain range.

LAURA: And Gatshadow is where Grog got his scar, right?

MATT: Yep, that's where you guys initially… that happened.

TRAVIS: All right. Fuck. Look, if there's a lot of them, and only a handful of us, it's not usually customary to have two sides go at each other. If we want those Knuckles, I'm pretty sure it might have to be one on one. Now, I know I can totally take my uncle. But I wouldn't mind if we found a few extra-credit items before we did that just in case I have the flu that morning, or it burns when I pee. Just something to take the edge off.

SAM: So sphinx first.

TRAVIS: If that's what you want to do, then yeah!

SAM: Say no more.

MARISHA: Okay. And did we also want to check out the Cobalt Reserve which was in Westruun, or did Allura already handle that and we're cool?

LAURA: Allura, I think, handled that, right? You saw her.

MARISHA: She was there and it looked pretty trashed. It looked like she grabbed a lot of the last of the good things.

SAM: All right. Let's go to the sphinx, then. Where's that? The Frostweald, we've been there.

LAURA: Yes, we have been to the Frostweald.

SAM: Do you remember any trees there?

LAURA: Frostweald is where Grog mugged down with the nymph, right?

LIAM: Allegedly.

LAURA: Allegedly.

SAM: We'll never know.

TRAVIS: Grog does not kiss and tell.

LAURA: Yes, you do.

TRAVIS: All the time.

LIAM: All the time. All the time.

MARISHA: Just not that one time that we want to actually know.

SAM: Let's go to the Frostweald.

LAURA: Let's do it!

SAM: Do you remember any trees?

MARISHA: Do I remember any trees?

MATT: At the time, because you were not specifically paying attention to this ability of yours, there is no specific tree that has caught your attention. You could attempt to make an intelligence roll.

MARISHA: Not my strong suit. A straight intelligence check? Nine.

MATT: Nine. Unfortunately, you can't recall the specific location of any trees in the Frostweald. It's been a long time since then, and you weren't being conscious of it at the time.

MARISHA: It's been a few years, you guys.

TALIESIN: All trees look the same, don't they?

MARISHA: After a while.

TALIESIN: Say it. All trees look the same.

LIAM: All right. Everybody hop on Vex's broom.

LAURA: I mean, we could try.

MARISHA: I could get us close, or I could scry and look for a tree.

MATT: If you would like to, yeah.

MARISHA: Can I take time to do that?

MATT: If you want to, yeah. The trees in the area that you would know, that you recall, there was a… There were trees based around the Crossroads, which is the middle point of the Silvercut roadway that's even further northwest, and west of Westruun. There's the Bramblewood Forest, which is just north of Westruun. Most of them would be further west from there. Those are the closest.

MARISHA: The closest destination. Would the Crossroads be good? Maybe get us to the Crossroads?

SAM: Or we could just go to Westruun. Is Westruun still there?

LAURA: Westruun's under dragon rule. There's an actual dragon on Westruun.

MATT: Not on. Up in the mountain, but watching down, probably.

MARISHA: But they've got wyverns policing, right, in Westruun?

MATT: You didn't notice in your scry.

MARISHA: I'm going to assume. Let's do the Crossroads.

LAURA: Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it!

MARISHA: We could theoretically run into your herd, though.

TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, I hope we do.

LAURA: Yeah.

MARISHA: To the Crossroads!

MATT: Okay. So you're going to the Crossroads. The Crossroads is about two days of travel northeast of the Frostweald, about three days' travel.

MARISHA: So I would be going northeast from the Crossroads? Or if I wanted to go in the Bramblewood I would have to southwest to get to the Frostweald?

MATT: Here we go. This is the Frostweald. This is Westruun. This is the Crossroads. This is Emon. This is Kraghammer.

LAURA: Oh shit.

MARISHA: Where's the Bramble forest?

MATT: It's right here. It's by Westruun. The Crossroads is over here. You can totally take the Crossroads, but it'll be–

LAURA: Go to the forest.

MARISHA: Let's go to the forest. Let's go to the Bramblewood forest.

MATT: Bramblewood forest? Okay, that's fine.

MARISHA: There's got to be some big trees there. I remember a few big trees. I remember admiring a few big trees in the Bramblewood forest.

MATT: Because you spent a lot of time in Westruun, specifically, you do recall various locations. You take a moment to concentrate on a few trees actually within Westruun. You recall there was one that was near a playground where you had once interrogated a small child if they had seen–

TALIESIN: Yeah! I remember that!

SAM: We spent a whole day in that park.

MATT: Yep. You begin to cast the spell and you concentrate on that tree in the park. There's no connection to the tree. You gather that the tree may not have survived the initial attack on Westruun. However, you do take a moment and you do recall at the entrance to the Bramblewood, when you guys were briefly attacked by that group of thieves that were pulling you off to the side, pretending to be a stranded caravan.

MARISHA: That was good.

MATT: There was a series of rather large trees that marked the roadway there, and you recall one that had distinct markings, and you do manage to find a point of concentration or connection there.

MARISHA: I guess it took me a moment to find signal. Okay. All right. We're good.

SAM: You need a signal boost.

MARISHA: I think I got one.

MATT: You complete the spell against one of the petrified trees on the outside of the Cindergrove. The doorway opens up, and you guys can see a thicket of Bramblewood trees on the opposite side. You all rush through one after the other, Trinket jumping behind. You all make it through, and you're now standing on the central pathway of the Bramblewood. Further south, you're probably about an hour and a half foot travel before you exit the southern portion of the forest.

MARISHA: All right, sorry, guys, this is as close as I could get us.

LAURA: No, this is great!

SAM: And how far are we now? A day's travel? Two days' travel, you said?

MATT: To the Frostweald? You're about a day and a half. On horseback you're about a day, under a day. On foot, you're looking at about two days' travel, a little over two days' travel.

SAM and LAURA: Ugh.

MATT: That's a rapid pace.

MARISHA: Mist form.

TRAVIS: Or we go where?

MARISHA: We could be clouds.

SAM: We're not very fast in mist form, are we?

LAURA: No, we are, we're super fast.

SAM: Are we?

MATT: You're fast in mist form.

MARISHA: How long would it take to get us in mist form?

MATT: It would be a little bit faster than a horse.

SAM: Like a day.

MARISHA: Should we turn into clouds and go?

SAM: I haven't done this before. Is it freaky?

LAURA: I pop Trinket back into his little crystal.

SAM: Is it super freaky?

TALIESIN: It's so super freaky.

SAM: All right.

LAURA: Percy, what if instead of a seat, what if it was like I was straddling it, and there were two little things like footholds?

TALIESIN: I'm sorry, do you want to design this?

LAURA: No, no, it's up to you. It's totally you.

TALIESIN: Are you sure?

LAURA: I was just coming up with ideas to help you out.

TALIESIN: You're welcome to design this, it's just going to be much more expensive.

LAURA: No, no, it's all you. It's all you.

MATT: So, Keyleth, what are you doing? Are you doing the–

MARISHA: Yeah. I'm picking my spells because I haven't done that yet, but yeah. We'll poof!

MATT: So Keyleth goes ahead and casts– Is it Wind Walk?

MARISHA: Wind Walk.

MATT: All of you guys take a moment to transform into a mist form, and you all begin to coast right around the top of the trees, making your way south to the back of the Bramblewood. As soon as you exit the top of the trees, you can see Westruun ahead of you, and there are a number of interesting things that catch your attention. First and foremost, you see, halfway between the treetops to the south end of the forest and the very north part of Westruun, there appears to be a large, green open field with thicker patches of grassland here and there. There is a section that is a grassless dirt mound, that has, as you start coasting over you can see, what looks like spikes of wood, a couple of things that glimmer in the light as you pass over, and what looks like large grooves dug in a haphazard pattern. This patch is about 15 or 20 feet across, and you see two people bringing a cart away from it.

LAURA: Can we mist down a little closer to get a better view of what it is?

MATT: Yeah. These wispy people-clouds (wind).

TALIESIN: Those clouds look like half-elves!

MATT: No one seems to pay mind. The two individuals that went away with the cart are a little far from what you can see at this point, but they both appear to be humanoid, in no particular rush but they're hauling this large cart away. As you look, you can see in this patch of dirt, the glimmers that you saw was a smattering of gold and silver coins that appear to have been tossed into this pile. It looks like there are pieces of wood that have been broken and crushed in the giant grooves. Who's taking the intense look at this one right now? Okay, so the two of you, I want you to roll investigation checks.

TALIESIN: 18.

LAURA: Wow. No, 16 for me.

MATT: You recognize, and you get a feel for it too, because of your specialty in this, you notice that the giant grooves that tear into this are actually sweeping claw marks, like something of a large size and a very fast speed came down, and has come down multiple times, to snatch up something that was placed in this location.

LAURA: Oh, this is where they make their offerings.

TALIESIN: This is where the offerings are made.

LAURA: That's good to know. I have advantage on anything having to do with dragons.

MATT: Right, which, as you're seeing this now, yeah, you would gather the information with him as you did. Do you guys continue southward?

MARISHA: Yeah.

MATT: Coasting on the outskirts of the city?

LAURA: It's good to know that that's there, though.

TRAVIS: We could set an ambush later.

LAURA: Yeah!

MATT: You guys begin to coast around the outside of Westruun, drifting up above as well, this wispy pattern of clouds. You get a view of the external farmlands that dot the north-northwestern side of Westruun. A number of them appear to have been burned. Not like forest fire or cataclysmic meteorite, like intentionally burned. The crops are charred and black, and there's a pattern to how that was set. A few farmhouses also appear to have burned as well. But there are farmlands that are also functional, and you can see people tilling the land. I want everyone to make a perception check.

TRAVIS: A what?

LAURA: Perception.

TRAVIS: 14.

MARISHA: 16.

TALIESIN: 18.

SAM: Three!

LAURA: 31.

LIAM: 22.

MATT: Okay, so people above 20 would be the twins. All right, so Vex and Vax, you guys look over these fields and two things you notice. One, each set of farmers that are working, there is a well-armed individual on the outskirts of each of these farms that is intently watching them work. As you're paying attention to this, one of them walks over and starts screaming at one and pushes them over, and then stands back and keeps guard. You also notice that the outside of the city, there appears to be some sort of construct or battlements, almost like another wall, a very thin wall, has been built around the various entrances to the city.

LAURA: They've imprisoned the people. We can't talk to each other.

MATT: Can't talk to each other, no, not in mist form.

TALIESIN: Just vape at each other.

TRAVIS: Do we keep going, or do we– Somebody make a choice. Down or keep going?

LAURA: I don't know what good we'll do right now.

MARISHA: Can't do anything right now.

TALIESIN: You're the only two that have noticed.

MATT: It's up to you guys. Do you guys want to go investigate, or do you want to keep going south?

LAURA: I mean, how many guards are there around there?

MATT: You only see two that are actually in the immediate farmland, and they're quite a walk away from the actual city. They don't appear to be on heavy lockdown.

LIAM: As wind, I'll pull in front of my sister and use windiness and wind hands and wind farts to put up a stop sign with my hands and point down if that's possible in this form.

MATT: Yeah, that's possible in the form. Vex, you see Vax, your brother, stop in front of you, put his hands up, and point downward with his hands.

LAURA: What do you want to do? What do you want? I noticed it too.

TALIESIN: I float on over to this.

LIAM: I'm going to go down and I'm going to motion for her to follow.

TALIESIN: All right, going down.

MATT: You guys all follow?

TALIESIN: I'll solidify on the ground.

SAM: I'm still thinking about, what were those big gashes in the ground back there?

MATT: Yeah, it was really confusing to you. All right, you guys all drift down towards the ground as you see Vax begin to take on physical form on the outskirts.

LAURA: Oh, shit. Can we stealth? As we come out of it, I want to cast Pass Without a Trace immediately.

MATT: Okay. Are you going down to the burnt farmland or one of the healthy farms?

LAURA: Can we go down in an area that there's shadow, to where we're hidden?

MATT: There are a few of the fields that are more high crop, corn-style stalks.

LAURA: Somewhere that when we take form, we'll be hidden.

TRAVIS: Just you two, right?

LAURA: I don't know.

TALIESIN: I'm going down, too.

TRAVIS: You three?

MATT: Okay. Percy, Vax, and Vex all take a moment to revert back to their physical form.

SAM: Oh, I'm reverting, too. I'm a follower.

MATT: All right, Scanlan. Keyleth?

MARISHA: I guess so.

TRAVIS: Wow, we're just going to make this super obvious, huh? There are dragons flying overhead.

TALIESIN: Well, we've landed.

MARISHA: We're in a corn field.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we've landed. Let's do it. We all want to die.

MATT: All right, so all of you, including Grog, or are you staying in your mist form?

TRAVIS: Fuck it. Let's do it. I'm changing.

MATT: You all take a moment to revert to your physical form. I would like everyone to make a stealth check.

LAURA: And I cast Pass Without a Trace, so it's extra ten.

MARISHA: Ooh! Natural 19.

TRAVIS: Hey, 18!

LAURA: 32.

LIAM: 25.

LAURA: Add ten!

LIAM: 35!

TALIESIN: 31.

SAM: 29.

MARISHA: 36.

SAM: We're all good.

TRAVIS: 28.

MATT: What did you get again?

LAURA: 32.

TALIESIN: You don't know we're here anymore.

MATT: Where'd the party go? You all begin to weave your way through the various lines of high-stalk crop. Where are you heading? Are you heading in towards the city, or are you heading towards the farmers?

LAURA: We just want to sit here for a minute and talk about it. Can we just say, so here's the thing. Those guards are attacking the farmers. I'm pretty sure they're using slave labor at this point. Kind of like you, Scanlan! Slave labor to provide food for the city. Vax really wanted to stop down, but the thing is, if we kill the guards and set the farmers free, everybody in the city might starve. It's a tough situation right now.

TALIESIN: Or they might just send more guards, once they know that one's been killed, and then kill everybody involved.

LAURA: I'm afraid right now I don't know what all we can do in this town until we can defeat the dragon, which unfortunately is rather close.

MARISHA: It's a bigger problem.

TALIESIN: We can't do anything for them right now until we actually know what's happening.

MATT: As you guys are having this conversation, you can see there's a slight rustle, and a farmer comes across, carrying a small satchel as he's picking things off of one of the nearby areas.

TRAVIS: Is he close to us?

MATT: About 15 feet from you.

MARISHA: Does he see us?

MATT: He doesn't seem to notice you guys.

LAURA: I mean, we can tell him to hold out hope.

TALIESIN: Maybe he knows what's going on.

LAURA: He could also be one of the assholes that's serving the dragon, just like people in Emon.

TRAVIS: I go (clicks).

MATT: The farmer turns. (gasps) You now see him. It's a man in his late 40s, early 50s, gray beard.

TRAVIS: Shh! Help me out. Shh.

MATT: “Yeah…”

TRAVIS: Shh!

LAURA: Act natural!

TRAVIS: Keep picking!

LAURA: Keep picking!

MATT: He keeps picking.

LAURA: Hey, you. Do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon?

TALIESIN: In the interest of the internet, we should probably do stage whispers.

LAURA: Do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon?

MATT: You can see there's some heavy bruising on his face and part of his cheek is swollen. He goes, “It would be hard around these parts to find someone who likes a dragon, let alone that one.”

LAURA: Good.

MATT: “Not the worst of the worries right now, though.”

LAURA: What's the worst?

MATT: “The ones who work for him.”

LAURA: Right. So you have to provide food for everybody living in the city? Is that how that goes?

MATT: “Every one of them. Otherwise they just go ahead and steal from whoever's nearby. Isn't a caravan that's made their way past Westruun in the past week.”

LAURA: Well, here's the thing. We're trying to help you. We're trying to find a way to (clicking) (choking) kill the fucks. You get me? Ill-kay the agons-dray.

MATT: Drops the fruit he has in his hand. “Please! Please help us, please!”

LAURA: Act natural! Keep picking, keep picking, keep picking! We want to help you. We really, really, really want to help you.

MATT: “They have my daughter.”

LAURA: Oh, shit.

TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

SAM: Who has your daughter?

TALIESIN: No daughters right now.

MATT: “Those beasts.”

SAM: Beasts? What beasts?

LAURA: The guards? They're keeping your daughter?

MATT: “Keeping a lot of people.”

TRAVIS: Do you know where they keep them?

MATT: He leans over, nudges towards the direction of the city.

TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

MATT: “I don't know his name.”

SAM: And that spot that we saw, just outside of town, that's where gold is given to the dragon? Do you know anything of that?

MATT: He looks a little confused. “I don't know. They just take what we have.”

LIAM: The guy, you don't know his name. What does he look like? Where have you seen him?

LAURA: Keep your voice down!

LIAM: I'm talking through Skype, so it's a little more difficult for me!

MATT: Who are you talking about?

LIAM: The guy who's got your child. You don't know his name. What does he look like? Where have you seen him?

MATT: “I don't know. They're all different types, I haven't seen the one who has them. They have them.”

LAURA: They, the guards? The people that serve the dragon?

MARISHA: What type of people are they interested in?

MATT: “Half-orcs– Interested in? Whoever keeps him at bay. I don't know, they take whoever seems useful. Sometimes they take them and slaughter them before us as a warning.”

MARISHA: Then why did they take your daughter?

MATT: “I don't want to think about it.”

LAURA: To keep him working!

TRAVIS: Look. Say we were really bored, and we wanted to get you your family back. Where would you go?

MATT: He points over to the city. “But there's one right out…” And you see him pointing angrily around the corner, probably to the one that you saw on the outskirts of the farm area you guys came down in.

TALIESIN: Let's go to the city then, I suppose.

SAM: Wait, what?

LAURA: There's a dragon!

SAM: To do what, to attack half-orcs that work for a dragon?

LAURA: Farmer. What's your name?

MATT: “Reginald.”

LAURA: Reginald. Reginald, we want to help. How often do you see the dragon flying around?

MATT: “Once every couple days, maybe.”

LAURA: Once every couple days. When was the last time you saw him?

MATT: “About half a day ago. Dusk yesterday. I don't know. We all stay inside around that time just in case.”

MARISHA: Does he have patrols? Does he have wyverns working for him as well, that fly around?

MATT: “I haven't seen anything flying but the dragon. There was a huge fight not more than a week ago between these people and that thing. They seem to have come to an accord.”

MARISHA: These people?

SAM: The orcs?

MATT: “The orcs, the whatever they are. The big strong angry ones that keep taking all of our stuff.”

MARISHA: Oh, no.

LAURA: (gasps)

SAM: What, what?

LAURA: What do they look like?

MARISHA: Do they look like him, maybe?

MATT: “Some do.”

TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me.

LAURA: Shit.

TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

MATT: “The dragon came in and tore everything down.”

TRAVIS: Damn it. Shit hammer.

MATT: “Burned, liquefied, dissolved portions of this city, people screaming. And then it left. Both of them.”

SAM: You'll be okay. We're going to keep going. Good luck.

TRAVIS: No, wait, wait.

LAURA: Scanlan!

SAM: No, we have to keep going. We can't face these goliaths and dragons and orc guards! This is craziness!

MARISHA: One of the dragons was green?

MATT: “From what we saw.”

LAURA: Green and a black.

MATT: “Green and a black. I think a white one, but that one kept going.

SAM: I mean, we'll be fine.

MARISHA: And the green one kept going?

MATT: "All of them kept going. We thought we were safe. We tried to re-gather. And then, within a day, a bunch of these bastards came and took what was left. Slaughtering, stealing.”

TRAVIS: We've got to go get his kid.

LAURA: I feel like we have to help them. We have to help them!

MARISHA: Oh man. I feel like you all are talking like I normally do, and I'm talking like Grog normally does. This is such a weird day.

SAM: No, you're using way too many prepositions.

TRAVIS: You said there are a lot of people that look like me.

MATT: “From what I've seen. I don't go too far into town, they keep me out here, but I've seen a few.”

LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for the guard. I want to keep an eye out for the guard, make sure he's not noticing.

MATT: Perception check.

TRAVIS: They're in the city?

MATT: “Most of them are, yeah.”

SAM: Were there six of them?

LAURA: 17.

MATT: 17, okay. You don't see the guard nearby.

TRAVIS: We need that guard.

MARISHA: What are we going to do right now?

TRAVIS: We're going to ask him some questions.

MARISHA: This is a coup on a grander scale than Whitestone that we're talking about.

TRAVIS: I just want the guard.

SAM: Where's the guard? Can we see him?

MATT: You guys want to try and find him?

LAURA: Well, I saw him on the other side of the thingie.

MATT: Okay. You guys begin making your way towards the direction that Vex saw the guard. You start pushing through the crop, making your way to the edge, and at the point where these high crops end, it opens up into what looks like a heavy root-based field. Potatoes, carrots, things that are beneath the ground. You guys see across the way the two other farmers that were out there, the one that you saw being loosely beaten, they're both filling satchels and emptying them into two larger carts that are put up to horses, one of them a larger pony. You see what appears to be another hulking humanoid, taller than an average person, skin slightly gray, a smattering of tattoos across the body. You recognize–

LIAM: And best we can tell, he's the only guard? The only one?

TRAVIS: No, there's two. There's two.

LAURA: I have an idea!

SAM: Wait, he was about to tell us who it is.

MATT: From what you can see, you actually recognize this individual.

TRAVIS: Fucking nipple tassels!

MATT: This is an individual that you knew quite a ways ago, a young goliath who was still about a half a foot shorter than you when you knew him. He was named Horace, because he hated it, and Kevdak gave him this name and you actually, at some point in the past, recall even giving Horace a good beating. A little of the smaller of the goliaths you've encountered. This is years later. This punk kid, and he was kind of a punk, has grown up now, and is still smaller than you by a size, but still seems to be every bit of an agitating little bitch you remember, from the way that he's treating these people.

TRAVIS: Is he holding anything?

MATT: Not in his hand at the moment, no, but he does have across the back what looks to be some sort of large blade sheathed.

LAURA: Can I give my idea?

TRAVIS: Yep.

LAURA: What if we ask Reginald to call for help, like he needs this fuck's help, and then he comes over, and then we spring a trap on him.

MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

LAURA: I can use Hide in Plain Sight on us, and hide us, and make us look like we're part of the crops.

TRAVIS: I love it.

LAURA: To set an ambush.

TRAVIS: I love it.

LIAM: And the goal is to question this guy or to take him out? To question, yeah?

TRAVIS: We're going to ask him questions, and if he makes a peep– Hold on, before we do that. Can you see the other guard that was out here?

MATT: Glancing about, because it is a pretty open area, you can see the secondary guard is walking away, looking to check one of the other homesteads. There is a farmhouse.

TRAVIS: It's like Kansas, right, it's flat?

MATT: Yep, it's flat farmland on the outside of Westruun. As soon as you break the south side of the Bramblewood, it's just plain.

TRAVIS: What distance would you put him at? How far away would you put him? 100 yards?

LAURA: The other guard?

MATT: I'd say the other guard's probably a good 400 feet.

TRAVIS: Do it.

LAURA: Yeah?

TRAVIS: Do it.

LAURA: Can I take a minute to camouflage us and then tell Reginald to call him over?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: When he comes over, I grab him. Nobody do anything that's loud.

LAURA: Got it.

MATT: Okay. So, as you all take a moment, stepping into parts of the stalks of the edge of this land, Vex, you go ahead and start taking up leaves, patches of dirt, mud from freshly watered ground, and you start smattering the rest of the group with it. You guys are going full Arnold from Predator. You begin to blend into the vicinity.

MARISHA: Question. Could I work with Percy?

TALIESIN: Yes?

MARISHA: I have Entangle learned today. Could we fashion a quick Entangle trap, where when the guy steps into it he'll be entangled? Or I could maybe just be prepared for it?

MATT: You can be prepared for it when it happens.

MARISHA: I'll be prepared for it.

TALIESIN: I'm going to draw her a little sketch of something that would spring, that you can make out of wood.

MATT: The spell expends when cast, so it's more of waiting to release it. To make it as part of a set trap, that would be a consumable trap you would have to construct.

MARISHA: All right. I'll just be prepped with it.

MATT: Okay. So you guys all have hidden.

LAURA: Reginald.

MATT: He's behind you guys, watching all of this happen. “Yes?”

LAURA: Act like you're still picking and act like you hurt your ankle, and call for help from that guard over there. We'll protect you.

MATT: “Promise?”

TRAVIS: Yeah, I promise.

MARISHA: And try and maybe keep a bit of a distance, because I'm going to be doing a trap here. It's going to be 20 feet. You don't want to be in it.

LAURA: Just step back and call for help.

MARISHA: Just step back, all right?

MATT: So you guys are all working on the very edge of where these crop fields begin. Reginald pushes through a little bit, and goes, “Ow! Ow! Ow!” You hear in the distance a voice go, “Hey you! What's your problem?” He goes, “My ankle!” And he starts hobbling into the crop. “You shut your trap! It's your fucking ankle! What's that stupid– Oh, you–” (grunts) He starts lumbering up. “I'm going to teach you about letting a peep out of that stupid maw of yours! I'm going to beat that face so hard it can't make a noise ever again! Stupid git!”

TALIESIN: And now.

MARISHA: (whoosh)

LAURA: The minute he's in the high crops so he's out of visual from the other guard.

MATT: Okay. So as soon as he steps into the high crop area.

MARISHA: I'm waiting for Percy's cue.

TALIESIN: Now!

MATT: All right. So what are the specifics of the Entanglement spell?

MARISHA: 20 feet.

SAM: It always works and it catches whoever you want!

MARISHA: It always works…

MATT: All of a sudden all of the crops, all of the large stalks and vines start (whoosh) wrapping around his body.

LAURA: Shit, mother bitch!

SAM: What's wrong?

LAURA: That's a bit obvious.

MARISHA: Is it obvious?

MATT: It's once he's inside the area, so it's not like the wall on the outside.

LAURA: Okay. I was picturing all the plants suddenly losing their shit.

MATT: No, just the ones in the immediate vicinity.

SAM: Like a used car lot?

MATT: Okay, so he's going to attempt to make a strength saving throw.

LIAM: I'm going to squat at the edge of the high crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was walking off just to make sure he's oblivious.

MATT: Make a perception check, if you could, Vax. Surprised so he has disadvantage on the saving throw. What's the DC?

MARISHA: Me? 19.

MATT: 19? That's a failure. All right, and what?

LIAM: 28.

MATT: 28! Yeah, Vax, keeping an eye, the guard doesn't seem to have kept notice and continues walking off towards the distant farmhouse. The plants all wrap around his body and he: “What's this? Stupid– ”

TRAVIS: I run over and I tackle him, knock him to the ground, put my hand over his mouth, punch him in the forehead. Punch him again. Punch him a third time. And I barely lift my hand.

MATT: “You motherfucker– ”

TRAVIS: Punch him again.

MATT: At this point, now he's got blood pouring out of the corner of the eye. One eye has gone a little red from burst vessels. You can see it starting to swell up already. Blood's now pouring out the side of the nose where you've hit it, and he's still fighting even though the plants have kept him entangled. As soon as the calm comes to him (heavy breathing).

TRAVIS: (sing-song) Horace.

MATT: The eyes go wide and all the tension in the body loosens. “Fucking hell.”

TRAVIS: (muffled) Fucking hell.

MATT: You're still holding his face? (muffled) “Fucking hell.”

TRAVIS: I'm going to move my hand. If you make a sound, wash, rinse, repeat, yeah? Nod. Shut the fuck up.

MATT: He spits a couple teeth out the side of his mouth.

TRAVIS: You're looking big.

MATT: “You're supposed to be dead. You're supposed to be fucking dead. I watched you beaten to death. "Why the fuck are you still alive?”

TRAVIS: Yeah, right. Funny thing about me. So look, who else is out in this field with you right now?

MATT: “No one. It's me and Cole, but Cole's heading back to the city. We have other ones passed out around, but most of them stay in town, especially during the day. That's where the festivities are.”

LAURA: Festivities?

MATT: “Do you want back in? You're alive, man. Now's the time. It's a good time for the herd.”

TRAVIS: Yeah, no I want back in, for sure. That's what I've come here for: to come back in. But here's the thing. It's a bit of a surprise, right? Other people haven't seen me. You like a good surprise, right, Horace?

MATT: “Yeah?”

TRAVIS: Yeah. I thought you might. Here's my question: have you seen my cousin Zanror? Is he in the city?

MATT: “Probably, aye.”

TRAVIS: Right. And what about Kevdak?

MATT: “Kevdak stays in the city, as well. Up at the old Margrave's place, actually. Turned it into his palace. Want me to take you?”

TALIESIN: Before we go any further, what do I roll if I want to find out if Horace really does like surprises? I'm not kidding.

MATT: Make an insight check. All of you guys are still hidden, by the way, unless you want to do something.

TALIESIN: No, I'm just watching.

LAURA: And we gained another plus ten, so now we have plus 20 to all of our stealth, by the way, from that Hide in Plain Sight.

SAM: Wait, what?

LAURA: We have Pass Without a Trace, which adds plus ten, Hide in Plain Sight adds plus ten. That's what I camouflaged us fucking for.

SAM: How do you have all these things?

MATT: All of you guys make another stealth check with plus 20.

MARISHA: Natural 20, so 40. Actually, I have a stealth of seven.

LAURA: 46.

TALIESIN: 43.

MARISHA: 47.

MATT: You guys have never been seen. Retroactively, no one's ever seen you in your entire lives.

TALIESIN: I could fire my gun, at this point, and they'd be like, oh, rain's coming.

MATT: If it was Bad News, it would still probably break stealth.

TALIESIN: Well, if it was Bad News, yeah.

MATT: Okay, unless you rolled a one. Yeah, no. (laughs) Horace hasn't seen anyone. “I could take you in.”

TRAVIS: Right, listen. I was going to pounce on this poor farmer over here, but I saw you were obviously keeping your eye on him. Why are you doing that?

MATT: “Which one are you talking about? Reggie?”

TRAVIS: Yeah. Old Broken Foot over here.

MATT: (laughs) “He's a little bitch, that one is. No, but you know what? I caught him sniffing around. I think he's keeping some gold hidden.”

TRAVIS: Really? Gold? This poor farmer?

MATT: “Twisted his arm a couple of times.”

TRAVIS: Have you?

MATT: “We could do this for old times' sake. Each take an arm, pull until he tells us.”

TRAVIS: Oh, like wishbone?

MATT: “Yeah.”

TRAVIS: Yeah, that does sound like a good idea. Here's my thing. Why are you guys in this city? It's not really our thing to be in civilized places.

MATT: “Here's the thing. Let me get loose here for a minute. I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable.”

TRAVIS: No, I don't think I will, Horace.

MATT: “Okay. We were heading up north. We took out a small caravan just south of the road cuts, near the Silvercut Way, and all of a sudden out of the sky, we saw these streaking dragons come through. Largest I've ever seen. Dangerous as the day's long. So we fled. We watched them come here and tear into this city. Rend it, destroy it, smoke and flames and ice and all sorts of craziness. And they kept going. We figured, dragons come, didn't take the spoils, there's plenty of spoils for us. More than we could ever dream of. Most of it's pretty well-guarded, but there couldn't be much left over there. So we gathered up who we had, and mind you, the herd's swelled a bit since you left, my friend. We conquered another wandering tribe last year. Zanror took the head of their leader and commanded them to join. We're about a hundred strong these days.”

TRAVIS: Jesus.

MARISHA: Fuck.

MATT: “Pecking order. Still us goliaths at the top. We got all sorts of other piddly men.”

TRAVIS: Really?

MATT: “Half-men, half-orcs. A few brutalized elves here and there. They make cooking easy. Anyway, we took that moment and we rushed into the town. Took it before the day was over. Killed all who didn't bow before Kevdak himself. Days of revelry ensued, my friend. Oh, you missed out. Wine, women, gold. We took what we wanted until one of them dragons came back. Black one. Scary. Killed a lot of us. We weren't so much a hundred strong then, but by the end of that we had 50 or 60 to our name before the anger finally stopped. Kevdak bent a knee and made an offering to this dragon.”

TRAVIS: Kevdak did?

MATT: “I know. But trust me, you see a beast this size… it was survival through a mutual discussion, if you will. Promised our might to its worship, gathered our spoils, deliver it every now and then. We got to have the leftovers. We rule the city in its stead. Not a bad deal. Doesn't watch. We leave it what we find– most of it, at least, we keep a little on the side– and we live like kings here. Westruun is now property of the herd.”

TRAVIS: Well, it sounds really good.

MATT: “You've missed out, and there's quite a few openings now, since we've lost a few of the less than strong folk. You look strapping. I'm sure Kevdak would be more than happy to have you back.”

TRAVIS: I do. I've actually brought a few gifts.

LAURA: (whispering) I notch an arrow.

TRAVIS: I unsheathe Craven Edge.

MATT: “That's a good blade.”

TRAVIS: Isn't it. And I ask out loud, are you hungry?

MATT: “It's been probably half a day since breakfast. Aye. Why?” His expression begins to shift as realization begins to dawn on his face.

TRAVIS: I pull it back. I stick the point in between his ribcage, and I drive it up through him.

(shocked noises)

MATT: Before he can say a word– he tries to speak through the pain, but it's met with the gurgle as various bodily fluids fill the inside of his lungs and throat.

TRAVIS: Oh, more?

MATT: The blade, now, you can see (choking noise) peeks through the back of the mouth as his eyes go ever so dull, the rest of the blood flow pouring out the sides of his mouth.

TRAVIS: Pity that, acid reflux.

LAURA: Grog! Oh shit. Good job, there.

MARISHA: Vex?

MATT: As this is happening, the blood that has filled the mouth begins to seep back into the mouth. The trails are still there, but what was once filled to the brim has been slowly recessed, swallowed. Not by the unmoving body of Horace, but the dark blade itself now drawing from the inside.

LAURA: What the fuck is that sword, Grog?

TRAVIS: What?

LAURA: What is your sword doing?

TRAVIS: Nothing. It takes in the strength of who it slays.

LAURA: It takes in the blood?

TRAVIS: Did it do that?

LAURA: Grog.

TRAVIS: What?

SAM: You killed him. Was he related to you in some way?

TRAVIS: I don't know. I remember him. He was always a little shit.

MARISHA: Grog, do you remember killing him five seconds ago?

TRAVIS: Who?

MARISHA: Oh no. You guys.

LAURA: The little dude. Your little friend?

TRAVIS: Horace?

LAURA: You killed him. On purpose?

TRAVIS: Sure.

LAURA: You wanted to?

TRAVIS: Yeah, he was going to go tell about us.

MARISHA: You were conscious of that?

TRAVIS: What?

MARISHA: Is it me?

SAM: You're using too-big words.

TRAVIS: So listen, right? Either we stay and do some recon, or we take out the other guy that's walking back to the city. Really shouldn't be a problem. But if they're all in there, 50 strong, I don't think we're quite ready for that. The sneaky fucks in our group could go take a look, if you're feeling randy.

SAM: What would be our mission?

TRAVIS: Info only.

SAM: You killed this one quite easily.

MARISHA: Very easily.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but that's because we did it as a group.

MARISHA: Did we?

LAURA: Could we wait until nightfall?

SAM: I'm going to check out his body. See if there's any booty on his body.

LAURA: Well, as soon as we move, we won't be camouflaged in this crop anymore. We'll lose that.

MARISHA: Yeah, we won't look like crops.

MATT: As the stalks unwind, leaving his defiled body and you draw the blade free, Scanlan, you find, across the body, there is a simple, slightly chipped-but-still-functional greatsword that was sheathed in the back, wrapped in a haphazard hide that functioned as a scabbard. Mostly just leather pants, a few furs, looks to be a bone necklace and a bone bracelet around the wrist which looks to be teeth, human teeth. About 27 gold pieces in total change.

TRAVIS: How far are we from the city here?

MATT: About a five-minute walk.

TRAVIS: Five-minute walk. That's not far.

LAURA: Keyleth, can you use your powers to suck him into the ground so that nobody sees him?

TALIESIN: I honestly don't think they're going to find him, anyway.

LAURA: I use my abilities and try to camouflage the body so that nobody finds him.

MATT: You pull him up into one of the walls of the plant stalks and set him in there, mounding up whatever bits of fallen leaves and dirt you can. He's pretty well-hidden.

MARISHA: I use my Druidcraft to grow some flowers on top of the dirt.

MATT: Some flowers come up there. Some of the local leaves from the stalks bend down and help cover him up.

TALIESIN: Leave a couple of his human teeth that he's collected–

SAM: I'll leave all his human teeth, I'm not gonna take that shit.

MARISHA: Great, so very successful trip. Stopping down.

LAURA: Reggie?

LIAM: His partner's still long-gone.

TRAVIS: That guard?

LAURA: The other guard, yeah?

MATT: The guard's gone. Reggie's still sitting there, watched this whole thing happen. Looking at you and goes, “You did good. You did good.”

TRAVIS: I know I did. Just imagine what we'll do to the rest of them.

MATT: “Thank you. Thank you.”

SAM: Are we going to do anything to the rest of them?

LAURA: Right now?

TALIESIN: I think we're going to go take a look.

TRAVIS: I don't mind you taking a look, but be careful.

TALIESIN: We can also still turn into mist.

MARISHA: We can.

LAURA: They can't hurt us when we're mist.

SAM: We can all mist and go into the city and check it out.

LAURA: See what we see.

TALIESIN: Be fast and stealthy.

LAURA: Can we stealth while we're misting?

SAM: It doesn't matter if they see us, they can't do anything to us.

MATT: Yeah, it would be being conscious of the cloud patterns in the sky, moving with the wind in a way where you become less noticeable as something strange. So it's possible.

LAURA: Let's try that, so we can spy on the city! Get closer in.

TRAVIS: It feels kind of cheap.

LAURA: Why?

TRAVIS: I don't know.

LAURA: At least if we go in, Grog, we can see what we're up against.

TRAVIS: Yeah, but can't we use our eyes? Just as they are. Do we have to turn to smoke this time?

MARISHA: Why would we not?

TRAVIS: It feels a little cowardly.

LAURA: It's not cowardly, Grog, it's safe.

SAM: You can stay behind.

LIAM: What if Vex and I went as mist, just the two of us, quickly? Just the two of us.

TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fine.

TALIESIN: I may join you two for this as well.

LAURA: All right.

MARISHA: And what are the rest of us going to do? Just wait? Me, Scanlan, and Grog?

TRAVIS: You can turn into a cloud, and float in there, and see what you want to see, but I'm not turning into mist when my herd is inside that city. If I go in, I'm going in.

SAM: As Grog.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MARISHA: So why don't we just not go in right now?

SAM: Why don't you all go in, I'll stay back with Grog.

TRAVIS: Thank you.

LAURA: All right.

TALIESIN: Not crazy-ish.

MATT: All right, the four of you convert into mist form, crest up over the edge and start drifting your way over the top of Westruun, leaving Scanlan, Grog, and Reginald amongst the crops.

TRAVIS: Reginald, you want some ale?

MATT: “Do you have some?”

TRAVIS: No, I do, yeah, hold on. Get the cask out, pour him a cup.

MATT: He drinks thirstily, both because he seems genuinely thirsty, and second, it seems like he could use a long, hard drink.

TRAVIS: Pace yourself, son, there's a lot that's here.

MATT: “I've been drinking longer than you've been alive, friend.” Just (guzzles).

TRAVIS: Wow. Another?

MATT: “Yeah.”

TRAVIS: I'll keep them coming.

MATT: And, for that, we'll take a quick break, come back here. See you guys here in a few minutes, and we'll continue this story. See you in a minute!
Break

[break]
Part II

TALIESIN: Cock goblin.

MATT: Welcome back! Ha ha, they got it on stream! Sorry, Liam, we're not as good as you are at it. So, guys, quick note before we get back into the game. Apparently, the shirt link wasn't working earlier, it is working now. They got it functional, so go ahead and hop on now while you can. Returning from the break, as Grog and Scanlan sit, waiting to hear back from the rest of the team, traversing over towards Westruun, seeking information in their mist forms. The two of you remain behind. The four of you guys who are in mist form, where are you going?

LAURA: Can we stealthily head towards a pocket of people? Do we see a crowd of people being held?

MATT: This is your mist form?

LAURA: This is my mist form.

MATT: Ocean. I like it. I'd like you guys to make stealth checks.

LAURA: Stealth checks!

MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

LAURA: Yes! 39.

LIAM: 42.

TALIESIN: 33.

MARISHA: 24.

MATT: You guys make your way across the rest of the fields. You head over Cole, you can see walking his way to the outside of the western side of the city. You come towards the bottom of the gate. You can see the rigid, small fence structure you noticed when you were far away from the city becomes more clearly visible. It is a series of spears and pikes that are set up as a barrier or a barricade to the outside world to Westruun. You do see adorned atop a number of them a few heads, varying sizes, various people, various ages.

MARISHA: Does this appear to be goliath-built?

MATT: It's hard to say. It looks built.

LAURA: And the spikes are facing inward towards the city, or outward?

MATT: Outwards. There are breaks in it, but essentially it's partially a pseudo-defense mechanism, it's more as a warning, it's a point of intimidation.

MARISHA: So does it look pretty jerry-rigged?

MATT: Yeah. It's not anything too classically designed.

LIAM: No flying buttresses?

MATT: Not quite, no.

TALIESIN: Doric columns, oh my god! Awful! Tacky!

MATT: You coast over the outside wall and glance down within. You can see there are people wandering the town, townsfolk that are out in the streets. Many of them are in pairs or groups, two to four people, appear to be traveling from one place to another. Most of them are accompanied by one or two armed individuals. Some of the people have chains around their neck. You do see a number of these buildings are in ruins, patchwork places. Some are just crushed. Some appear to have been melted down, like the wood or stonework itself has been dissolved into a pile of matter. You see places where fires have broken out and some places have burned into a giant cluster of ash and broken wood. A quick memory glance at this height, you start looking for specific areas that you recall from memory. One: you glance over and see where you first came to meet Pike, where she and Wilhand lived. That area is the area of town that was, apparently, salvaged from the battle. It still stands, there appears to be very minimal impact. As you give yourself enough closeness to check in, the red brick homestead of Wilhand does appear to be standing.

LAURA: Can we see Wilhand anywhere?

MATT: At this distance, no. You also note, towards the shopping district of Westruun, there is the shop of Abjurist Noja, one of your first enchanter friends who protected you during your first Winter's Crest.

MARISHA: Yeah! He cast the protection spell on us!

TALIESIN: This is making me feel very old.

MATT: His structure is still standing as well. A few buildings around did not fare so well, but his shop and a number of other ones adjacent to it seem to still be standing. You can't really tell if they're functional, or how busy they are, or if anyone's doing anything with them, but that's still there. You do notice, though, at numerous parts of the street, there are just piles and piles of burnt wood and ash, like they're large burn piles that were set at different periods of time and have long since burned. Little bits of white, post-burning plumes that still smolder over the past few days. You're not quite sure what these piles contained at the time they were set ablaze. There is still the worship district here. You have the various temples. Best you can glance, a few of them have been partially toppled. There is damage to some of the buildings. Still too far away to make out any specific details beyond that, some of the structures having taken a hit in previous conflicts. You're not sure from which source.

LAURA: What about the mayor's house where we heard Horace–?

MATT: The Margrave's. Towards the southern central portion of Westruun, south of the main town square where the bulk of your first Winter's Crest festival here in Westruun took place. The Margrave's house is at the very southernmost portion of that. That entire square is lined with row after row of sharpened wood sticks and various other weapons, tridents, broken swords that have been, with ropes, strapped together to form a military barricade. If anything were to attempt to attack from the ground, it would be difficult to do so if this area was filled with prepared soldiers, using these as protective guard. The actual Margrave's home is intact, although at this glance, you can see a lot of it has been defiled, elements of the outside walls are strewn with dark burgundy paint slapped over. You can see what looks to be some sort of strings adorning edges of it, like decoration. You see, walking through this area, what looks to be 12 or 13 or so armed individuals of varying heights. Probably a good six or seven goliaths among them. Others appear to be human, half-orc, it's hard to make out the full details from this distance. They're all on the outskirts surrounding what was previously the Margrave's home. Now the homestead of Kevdak, seemingly.

LAURA: Can we see Kevdak anywhere?

MATT: You have no idea what Kevdak looks like.

LAURA: I look for a bigger goliath than the rest, or one that looks older and bigger.

MATT: Make a perception check.

LAURA: 16.

MATT: 16. At this distance, it's hard to make out any specific details. You can barely make out the fact that they're goliath. It's only because you've traveled with Grog so long you can pick out the details, the hairless form, the tattoos, the general tone of skin. They're male and female, it's a smattering of all different types of goliaths. Some of different thickness, some that are a little more barrel-chested and wide, some that are a little shorter. There are other similarly dressed individuals that are not goliaths as well, but they seem to be more of a subservient role within the herd than the goliaths that would be the ruling class within this self-contained society. But no one stands out to you as matching the descriptions of Kevdak that Grog gave you.

TALIESIN: The mansion seems to be where they've based their operations, though.

MATT: Seemingly.

LAURA: We don't see a cluster of prisoners anywhere out in the open?

TALIESIN: Where's the prison I was being held in?

MATT: The prison you were being held in was in the Umbra Hills. That's far north of Westruun.

LIAM: That's when we fought the Nightmare.

LAURA: Yeah!

TALIESIN: (laughs) (imitates Laura) Yeah!

LAURA: Do we see a cluster?

MATT: Do you see a what?

LAURA: A cluster of prisoners out in the open at all, or is it just out around–?

MATT: It's hard to tell because most everyone who lives here is, in some, way, shape, or form a prisoner. You do see at the various gates of the city as you went through, there's about three, four individuals average stationed there. Nobody seems to be entering or exiting. And the pace of those that are not of the herd that you see walking through the city has a feel of hopelessness, or at least their presence outdoors is more of function. They do what they're told, and if they're not, you've already seen what happens to them.

MARISHA: Now what?

TALIESIN: Maybe stealth isn't– maybe Grog's right– we can't talk, can we?

MARISHA: No, we're fucking clouds.

LAURA: Can we say go back to the–

LIAM: Yeah, I'm gesturing to go. Get out.

LAURA: Yeah, let's go back.

MATT: Make a stealth check, guys, on the way out.

SAM: 93.

TRAVIS: Scanlan and I have been alone.

LAURA: 39.

MARISHA: 32.

LIAM: 44.

TALIESIN: 26.

MATT: Okay! You guys make your way westward. Is there anything you guys wanted to accomplish while they were gone?

SAM: Just massage each other.

TRAVIS: Right, so I turn to Scanlan. And I say: you and I are mates, right?

SAM: Yes, the best of mates.

TRAVIS: Right. Could I confide something in you?

SAM: I wasn't aware that you knew what that word meant.

TRAVIS: (clears throat) Right. Well, I'm full of surprises. One of which is– so, I had this horrible dream recently, and in the dream, I was killing all these people with this amazing sword that I have.

SAM: Yes?

TRAVIS: But there were a lot of people, and some of the people that got killed I knew. And I feel it has something to do with this sword that I have. And the secret is: I can hear the sword talking to me.

SAM: Like, talking-talking, or you just–

TRAVIS: Yeah, look, so I'm telling you because you and I have such a history, right? And I feel like you won't judge me, but, like, I'm afraid the rest of the group won't quite understand. I don't know if I'm crazy or if this sword is talking to me.

SAM: Do you see a mouth on it or anything?

TRAVIS: No, I just hear a voice and I was wondering if maybe I take it out–

SAM: All the time?

TRAVIS: No, only when I'm holding it. So, like, I could take it out now and we could see maybe if you hear it.

SAM: Okay.

TRAVIS: So I take out Craven Edge.

MATT: You take out Craven Edge, you hold it out in front of you.

TRAVIS: Craven Edge. How did you enjoy your snack?

MATT: “It was a good snack. A snack it was. If there's more where that came from, I would be so thankful.”

TRAVIS: Are you getting that?!

SAM: No, Grog, I'm not.

TRAVIS: You're not hearing anything? No, like, super sexy (low-pitched growl) voice? Nothing?

SAM: Try one more time.

TRAVIS: No, it's not worth it. Look, do you want to hold the sword?

SAM: Sure! That's a good idea, actually! Can I hold the sword? How big is it?

MATT: It's a greatsword. It's almost twice the length of your whole body and probably weighs close to as much as you do.

SAM: Can you hold the top part and I'll just hold it by the handle, the hilty-part?

TRAVIS: I hold the blade, and I hand the hilt towards Scanlan.

MATT: As you hand the hilt over towards him, there's hesitation in the voice, “Only you are worthy of holding me. You will hand me to no one.”

TRAVIS: (grunts) See, now, now, now, Craven, I'm starting to feel like I'm doubting myself. I'm seeing things– he's talking to me.

SAM: Okay.

TRAVIS: I'm going to take it right back, I just want him to experience your glory.

MATT: Make a charisma check.

TRAVIS: Shit. Fuck. That's bad.

LAURA: No.

TRAVIS: (gulp) Seven.

MATT: Seven? Okay. You can't give the sword up. It means too much, and the voice in your head says, “Only those proven worthy to feed me can carry me. And you, Grog–”

SAM: Grog, hand me the sword.

TRAVIS: (pained) No. On second thought, don't worry about it. It's clearly– and I take it back– it's not, it's just– maybe I just need to see someone or talk to somebody. Clearly, I mean, you don't– it's talking, you don't hear it, right?

SAM: I don't hear it, but maybe if you handed it to me, I could.

TRAVIS: No, it's really heavy, too. And I sheathe it.

SAM: Do I believe him?

MATT: Make an insight check.

SAM: Not good.

MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

SAM: Not good! Seven!

TRAVIS: Three!

(laughing)

MATT: Grog's not the most able liar, you glean. You're pretty good at seeing past the deceit of others. This definitely falls under the line of deceit, as adorable as it is to see him try.

SAM: Grog, you want to give me the sword. And I will cast Suggestion on him.

LAURA: Ooh!

MATT: Is it a wisdom saving throw?

SAM: I haven't used it in a while, and I don't have my thing.

MATT: I'll pull it up real fast, just to make sure. I'm pretty sure it is.

TALIESIN: I think it is.

MATT: Yep, make a wisdom saving throw.

TRAVIS: Giant modifier on this one. 16. With a modifier of zero.

SAM: Well, 18, if I'm not using my thing.

MATT: Not using the cone, so no, it still fails. So you feel compelled now to give this sword. You're like, no, that's a great idea.

TRAVIS: You know what? That's a great idea! I feel like you should hold this sword. And I hold on to the blade, but I still hand the hilt to him.

MATT: As he holds up the sword towards you, you grasp the handle. As his hand touches it, the voice goes, “No! Only you can wield me!” Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw again.

TRAVIS: 18.

MATT: I'm sorry, that's a charisma saving throw.

TRAVIS: 19.

MATT: 19?

TRAVIS: Yeah, plus one.

MATT: All right. You feel the influence of the blade begin into creep into your mind, but the bond you have with Scanlan and the time you've traveled together, you manage to shrug it off. Fighting that impulse, you still hand the blade over. You take the handle. You let go of the weapon. You hold it in your hand now. It's a (heavy thud).

TALIESIN: You ruin everything good! You take everything good away from all of us!

SAM: Well, it's heavy.

TALIESIN: Throw it into acid, why don't you?!

TRAVIS: Ask it a question!

SAM: Oh! I talk to it?

TRAVIS: Yeah! And it'll talk right back, it's like that!

SAM: Oi, Craven Edge. Have you been talking to my friend Grog?

MATT: There's a long beat of silence. And then a barely audible (annoyed sigh).

LIAM: Sing to it!

MATT: All of a sudden, you hear this tiny voice creep up in the back of your head: “If you truly wish to hold me in your grasp, I require you to prove to me your worthiness.”

TRAVIS: Is it saying something?

SAM: No.

TRAVIS: No?! It's not saying anything?!

SAM: Craven Edge? How do I prove I'm worthy?

TRAVIS: What?

(laughing)

MATT: The blade, all of a sudden, it almost seems to have a slight shift of its own, like a divining rod, and it moves. And the blade shifts away from the direction of you and Grog and gently shifts down the way to an older gentleman who's now returned to picking a few crops and it points in his direction and says, “Prove to me.”

LAURA: Is it Reggie?

MATT: Pointing to Reginald.

LAURA: No!

MARISHA: Not Reggie!

TRAVIS: Why are you pointing it at Reggie?

SAM: I don't think I can. I don't think I want to. So I think I'll try to give the sword back to Grog.

MATT: Make a charisma check.

SAM: Is this magic?

MATT: It's not a spell. Let me double-check, if you're referring to the gnomish racial capability. Let me go ahead and check the rules here, because this could make a difference here.

SAM: Well, it's fine.

MATT: Against magic? I'll say yes, because it's technically a magical entity.

SAM: Natural 20.

TALIESIN: Witchcraft!

MATT: The sheer force of personality that begins to exude from this weapon, you sense that it is old, it has seen many a hand, and has probably taken far many more a life. But it's not met a gnome like you before, Scanlan Shorthalt.

TALIESIN: (singing) Never known a gnome like you before!

SAM: Take this back, will you?

TRAVIS: Yeah! I take it back. It talked to you, then, yeah?

SAM: Yes, it did.

TRAVIS: Right, it's creepy as shit.

SAM: It's very compelling. I don't know if you should have this, Grog.

TRAVIS: (confused sputtering) Now, hold on! I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't fucking, you know, batshit crazy, which I'm not! And I'm really glad that we're sharing in this now. But hey! Hey! Don't tell anyone. Promise me.

SAM: All right. I won't tell anyone. But I might have to ask some questions about this.

TRAVIS: No, that's why I brought you in! You're all smart, right? And I always want to ask questions like, what's the first thing it remembers, what was it doing with Lord Briarwood–?

SAM: Does it tell you to kill things?

TRAVIS: No!

SAM: A lot? I know it does, it just told me to kill something.

TRAVIS: You must be a dark wizard.

SAM: Does it tell you to kill things?

TRAVIS: No! It just says it's hungry.

MATT: At which point, you both hear a voice simultaneously go, “Always hungry.”

SAM: Yeah!

TRAVIS: You heard it that time! Holy shit! I feel like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams and you're James Earl Jones! I've got a friend in this now!

(laughing)

TALIESIN: Oh boy.

TRAVIS: Right, so, look, you know.

SAM: We should not tell the others about this. This is very strange.

TRAVIS: Yeah!

SAM: They might freak out.

TRAVIS: Right!

SAM: I'm going to ask about this. When next we see Pike, I'll ask her about it.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

SAM: Find out if it's good or bad or neutral. Because I don't know anything about this. Right, I don't know anything about this?

MATT: Make an arcana check.

TRAVIS: It could be good; there's nothing wrong with being hungry.

SAM: 12.

MATT: 12. It seems magical.

SAM: Yeah, I don't know. Don't know anything about this.

MATT: As a bard, you understand that there are certain artifacts, weapons that either upon their creation, upon their development, had the essence of a creature or soul put into it. Or, conversely, the weapon came into being as its own personality. You're not sure of the nature of this, and you're unable to ascertain which side of the spectrum it lies on as far as morality goes.

SAM: I'll do some investigating. In the meantime, try not to kill anyone in our party. If it tells you to.

TRAVIS: I would never!

SAM: Well.

TRAVIS: Never!

SAM: Okay.

TRAVIS: No, yeah there's never even, like–

SAM: Let's just keep this between us.

TRAVIS: Yeah, totes.

SAM: Just like that time in Emon when we–

TRAVIS: Yep!

SAM: –double-teamed–

TRAVIS: The Eiffel Tower!

SAM: Yep!

TRAVIS: Yep! All right!

SAM: It was a–

TALIESIN: Oh, that went up my nose!

LAURA: Ugh!

MATT: At which point, a few clusters of wind come landing out of the sky.

MARISHA: What? Green lights?

LAURA: That's us.

MATT: You guys, you're the mist!

MARISHA: (panicked yelling) Oh! It's just me!

TALIESIN: You're literally just scared of your hands.

MARISHA: (relieved) Oh!

TRAVIS: What did–

SAM: Nothing happened here. How was your trip?

TRAVIS: Yeah, boring here.

LAURA: Totally boring?

TRAVIS: Yep. No action.

LAURA: You know, not a lot to see there. There's a lot of goliaths and a lot of other bad guys walking around, oppressing very nice-looking people.

TRAVIS: A lot of goliaths?

MARISHA: They've made really poky fences everywhere.

TRAVIS: That's what I'd do.

LAURA: It looks like if we barged in, straight in, they'd probably have very good fortifications.

TRAVIS: Right.

MARISHA: I also think they're trying to be scary.

TRAVIS: Trying to be scary?

MARISHA: Not that you're not scary all the time, Grog. I just think they're like, ooh.

LAURA: They really want to look scary.

MARISHA: They really want to look tough, yeah.

LAURA: So, here's the thing. Do we barge in, totally risk our lives? Or try to find a way around this situation?

SAM: There's a central stronghold of some sort?

TALIESIN: Yes.

SAM: Is it a fortress?

LAURA: It's where the mayor lived before.

SAM: It's a house?

LAURA: Yeah, it's like a big house.

TALIESIN and MARISHA: It's a nice house.

SAM: And if we were to make our way into it, somehow, what would our mission be?

LIAM: Well, let's put on the table what we're doing here. Right? Kevdak has the Knuckles. We don't know where he is. He's probably pretty formidable on his own. And in a day or two, a dragon is going to be swinging by, so it's not one problem, it's a very large problem and a massive problem.

TRAVIS: Agreed.

LAURA: I wonder if Kevdak goes to the sacrificial area where they leave the hoard for the dragon.

TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

MARISHA: Or if he does rounds to check in on people.

TALIESIN: I'll also say I think it's more than likely that, in the end, I doubt the dragons would care who is filling the sacrificial plate.

LAURA: As long as someone is.

TALIESIN: As long as the plate's full.

TRAVIS: As far as this city goes, correct me if I'm wrong, but we have two options. Either we stealth in with the stealthy people, not me included, and we try and pickpocket Kevdak for the Knuckles. Or I challenge Kevdak for the Knuckles.

MARISHA: Is Kevdak known to ever wander off by himself? Does he take interest in his subjects to where we could corner him alone?

LAURA: Or is it a walk in and try to challenge him?

SAM: We could take out that guard, what was his name, Cole or something?

TRAVIS: Yeah, Cole was heading back to the city, though.

SAM: Well, we could find one of your goliath friends, hold them hostage, and draw out Kevdak that way.

TRAVIS: They won't care about a hostage.

MARISHA: There also could be the issue of are they going to go looking for Horace?

TRAVIS: Maybe. Not that hard, though.

SAM: We could do some sort of a diversion, set a fire or something that would draw them out. Or set a fire to the house they live in.

MARISHA: That's not a bad idea. What would bring Kevdak out?

TALIESIN: Grog. Grog would bring Kevdak out.

MARISHA: Grog?

SAM: Do you want to march in there, solo, while we stealth–

LAURA: No!

SAM: No, no, while we all stealth around in the rooftops watching, ready to act.

LIAM: Grog, I'm curious how tied you feel to the ways of your people now, or if you do. Do you feel the need, yourself, to face him on your own, or would you be amenable, would you be friendly to the idea of my sister and I softening him up for a moment, and then letting you have at it? What do you want to do here?

TRAVIS: So my fear is this: that if it's anyone but me and him, everyone gets involved. Not just us, but all 60 of them in that stronghold. I don't think we walk out of that very well. I'm not opposed to facing him head-on and seeing what fate has in store for me while you free any prisoners that might be around, or ransacking his house for any fun bits, but I think he's going to have the Knuckles on him.

MARISHA: Question. Is your herd and Kevdak the type where, if you start getting the upper hand in this fight, will the herd move to protect Kevdak?

TRAVIS: No.

MARISHA: So they'll honor a one-on-one fight? They'll honor that? They won't pull a fast one and swarm in when he's on his last leg?

SAM: Tell us this. If we walk in with you into town, is that not good? Should you walk into town alone and we lurk in the shadows?

MARISHA: Do you want to be on a hilltop, like standing on a hilltop? Because we could arrange that.

TRAVIS: I would need to think about it. Regardless, I think now is not the time. Perhaps we go look for Osysa's mate.

SAM: You don't want to do this now? It seems like now or never!

MARISHA: We know where Kevdak is, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

SAM: We may not know where he is after this.

TRAVIS: He seems pretty fortified. And we don't have Pike. And this is her hometown.

MARISHA: Judging by the– no, I didn't hear any of that.

LIAM: I want to throw something in here as well. And I don't know what to do in this situation, I'm looking to you all for guidance. But I do know two things. One is that I don't want you to fall, Grog. We need you. And I do not want you to fall to Kevdak. And second: if you do fall, I'm not willing to walk away without those Knuckles, not for me to use, but for us to use. We need those Knuckles. So if you are to fall at his hand, which I do not want, I don't know that I can honorably walk away.

TRAVIS: Well, yeah, speaking from a selfish position, if I fall, you can really do whatever the fuck you want. I think honor is bupkis at that point. So I don't mind what you do after that.

LAURA: You're not going to fall, Grog.

TRAVIS: No, no, no.

LIAM: My first point, Grog, I need you, we all do.

TRAVIS: That's very sweet. Uh. Emotion. I would like it if Pike was here.

TALIESIN: We know.

LAURA: We wait.

MARISHA: Look, could we hear Horace when he was interrogating him?

MATT: Yeah.

MARISHA: Judging by the way Horace was speaking, it sounds like they're pretty settled in for right now.

TRAVIS: They're not nomadic any more.

LIAM: Sitting pretty.

TRAVIS: Yeah, they ain't going anywhere.

MARISHA: So we know where he is now. It'll give us a little bit more time to formulate our plan? This is your fight, Grog, we'll follow you in this one.

LAURA: You want to go in there with Pike?

TRAVIS: Yeah.

MARISHA: Let's wait for Pike.

LAURA: We wait for Pike. We wait until Gilmore's up and standing and we bring Pike here with us.

MARISHA: Pike might even be an emotional trigger.

LAURA: For what?

MARISHA: The herd if they see her, maybe.

LAURA: They never met her.

MARISHA: That's true. They probably don't give any shits.

TRAVIS: Let's just do this. Let's go after Osysa's mate. If we don't learn or find anything incredibly valuable, we're at the same place we are now.

MARISHA: Good point.

TRAVIS: And then we can kick the tires.

SAM: Do we still have mist possibilities?

MARISHA: We do, we can float on.

LAURA: Is Reginald still around?

MATT: You notice that Reginald's sitting there, clutching his full stachel.

LAURA: Hi, Reggie!

MATT: “Hi!”

LAURA: So we're going to help you.

MATT: “Right.”

TALIESIN: We're going to go get some reinforcements.

LAURA: You might have to wait a little while.

MATT: “That's okay, but you're coming back, right?”

LAURA: We most definitely are. Spread the word that hope is alive. We will find a way to beat this.

MATT: “All right. I'll be careful. You be careful, too. Come back as soon as you think you can, when you're ready.”

LAURA: Don't tell anyone what you saw here, though, right?

MATT: “Good luck.”

MARISHA: If anyone asks where Horace is, what happened to Horace?

MATT: “I haven't seen him for days.”

LAURA: That's a good answer.

MATT: Spits on the pile where his corpse is. “All right. Hope to see you soon, then.” He turns around and begins walking back.

MARISHA: Reginald.

MATT: You guys all take a moment, collect yourselves, revert back to your mist form, coast out of the farmland, heading southward in the direction of the Frostweald. And there, we're going to finish our campaign for the evening.

MARISHA: Ooh, shit!

LAURA: Man, Grog!

MARISHA: Grog!

TALIESIN: Feeling the pressure now? Feel it?

LIAM: Grog showing restraint and caution!

LAURA: I like it! I want Pike here, too.

LIAM: Yeah, so do I.

TRAVIS: It's too big for Grog.

SAM: Could have taken them.

LAURA: You could totally have taken them.

TRAVIS: Could have. But it's where Pike and her family raised Grog.

LAURA: Seems appropriate.

TRAVIS: Her schedule's so busy, but if we can get her next week…

TALIESIN: Well, next week we do the sphinx, and then the week after.

MATT: We'll figure it out. We'll get her back sometime soon, right?

TRAVIS: We do.

LIAM: If it takes 17 episodes, we will.

MARISHA: You're in New York. Can you stuff her in your suitcase while you're there, bring her back?

LAURA: Good call!

MARISHA: Just commandeer her, she's tiny!

LAURA: She's little!

MARISHA: She might be a little loud.

LIAM: Skype is rough, guys, it makes me feel bad for Pike.

MATT: We'll have you back soon, buddy.

LIAM: I'm fine.

MATT: No, you're not! You need to be here!

LIAM: (fake crying)

MATT: I know. Hopefully we'll be having Ashley back when Blindspot releases her between seasons, we'll have her back for a few months.

MARISHA: Season break!

MATT: Whenever that happens soon. We'll see you guys back here next week for the next length of the journey of Vox Machina. Until then, is it Thursday yet? See you guys soon. 

Part I

MATT: Now, we bring it back. I will ask if we could turn that speaker down a little bit. A little bit more. That's good. Great. All right, guys. Let's plug in to the world of Exandria, as we begin tonight's episode of Critical Role. So, last we left off, the adventuring party of Vox Machina, traversing the lands in search of lost artifacts of wars of old, referred to as the Vestiges of Divergence, in hopes of eventually tearing down and defeating a conclave of chromatic dragons called the Chroma Conclave that have destroyed society all across the continent of Tal'Dorei and beyond, you returned to the outskirts of a city named Westruun that was very important in your early adventures, to find it, from a distance, partially destroyed by the dragon attack but a couple weeks before, and since taken over by what seems to be the remnants, now swelling in power and size, of Grog's old herd of wandering barbarians and various savages. Having taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron hand, it was also deemed not the right time to face this foe, and as such the party continued venturing southward in the direction of the Frostweald, where somewhere at the base of the Stormpeak Mountains, the mate of Osysa, the gynosphinx you had met in Vasselheim– her mate resides somewhere in this vicinity. That's all the information you have to go on as you head down towards the frozen forest. So. That's where we begin. As you guys continue pushing south from Westruun, seeing the distant pillars of dark smoke that slowly drift into the atmosphere disappear as the town itself vanishes over the horizon, you continue to push southward through the open grass fields. You continue traveling for the better part of a day, eventually coming up along the side of the Silvercut Channel, which is the river that comes down and cuts through near Kraghammer to the west of Westruun. It goes past Kymal and then eventually heads down in this direction, towards the Foramere Basin. You guys, travelling fairly quickly, as you're in your mist forms, which is making up a lot of the normal travel time you would have to worry about here, by the time the sun finally begins to set across the mountains– pay attention, please.

SAM: Yes!

MATT: Sorry.

LIAM: It's another beholder!

MATT: I've got plenty of things I could throw in here if you guys aren't paying attention!

TALIESIN: That's not funny.

MATT: No, it's really funny for me. As you guys continue pushing southward, as the sun slowly begins to set in the distance, you glance over towards the Foramere Basin. You can see, just over to the right, the city of Kymal, which has lights glimmering in the far distance. But what you see by the basin itself is this large lake that is centered in this region just north of the Frostweald. You can see where the two main rivers diverge before heading southward towards the ocean. There's a smattering of various tents that are clustered right towards the side of the riverbank and the edge of the lake itself. As you continue coasting overhead in your mist forms, you see small trails of smoke from smoldering campfires, clusters of people and families wandering the shore in this small group. You continue going forward?

SAM: I mean, we should check it out.

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: You don't have to, you can keep going.

SAM: It's a tent city?

MATT: It looks like it, yeah.

LAURA: They're refugees, probably.

SAM: Hundreds, thousands?

MATT: There's probably a few dozen, close to maybe 50, 60.

MARISHA: What do the tents look like? Do they look like military encampment tents, or refugee tents?

MATT: You can't really tell from this distance, especially as the light is beginning to slowly diminish.

TRAVIS: Can we float closer?

LAURA: We float down, we float down.

SAM: Oh, are we still mists?

LAURA: Yeah.

SAM: Oh my God.

TRAVIS: That whole description, and yes, we're still mists.

MATT: As you coast down closer, you get a better look, and yeah, there are about 50, 60 or so people on the outside. You don't have an idea of how many are inside the tents. Even more, most likely. But these tents are fairly ramshackle, barely standing, the people look destitute. They look like they're holding onto survival here on the outside of the city. You see a few boats that are going in and out on the shore, probably fishermen. There are a few bonfires that are now starting to kick up as the night's cold begins to swell in. It looks like this is a fairly “thriving,” a fairly functional refugee camp.

TRAVIS: Well, those that give a fuck, speak up.

LAURA: We can't, we're in mist form.

TRAVIS: Then like (hissing) in a direction.

LAURA: (hissing) I think we should help them. Maybe we can –

TALIESIN: (buzzing fart sound)

SAM: Good point.

LAURA: Maybe we can send them back to Whitestone.

TALIESIN: Maybe, if we could talk, which we can't right now.

LAURA: I float down. Into the trees, outside of the camp.

TALIESIN: I follow.

MATT: Okay. These are open grasslands, there aren't a lot of trees, and they're spotted around. There are a few rock formations and small hills, you might be able to get out of sight.

LAURA: Around there.

MATT: So you coast around there and you go back into your physical form. The rest of you follow?

TRAVIS: Tall grass? Low grass?

MATT: It's probably thigh-length.

LIAM: Following.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we go.

MATT: For you, close to the knee.

LAURA: Near the rocks, so that we're in camouflage.

MATT: So you guys set down maybe 300 feet from the outside of the nearest part of the camp, reconstitute into your physical forms. At this point, the sun has now disappeared over the horizon and the blues have now gone to orange, to purple, and you can see in the distance the darkness of night is starting to crest over the sky. What do you want to do?

TRAVIS: What are we stopped for? Are we here?

LAURA: No, it looks like a refugee camp, Grog.

TALIESIN: They may have information.

LAURA: People that escaped from Westruun, potentially.

TRAVIS: Oh, really?

LAURA: Yeah. I mean, it's a large group of people, I'm assuming they came from a city of some sort.

TRAVIS: Hey, Scanlan.

SAM: Oi.

TRAVIS: If we go over there and it gets a little hairy, you've still got old magic door, right?

SAM: Old magic doll?

TRAVIS: Hugh Hefner house!

SAM: Oh, yeah, magic door. Yes.

TRAVIS: Magic doll if you have it, too, for later, but yeah.

SAM: I mean, I have a little Pike figurine that I keep with me.

TALIESIN: Oh.

SAM: What, no, it's a keepsake!

TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it is.

SAM: Why is everything I say creepy?

LIAM: I don't know, why is it?

LAURA: Maybe we should pop them back to Whitestone. I feel like it might be good, if we find out if they're hurting. That's where we're putting our survivors.

LIAM: They look like they're hurting.

MARISHA: I couldn't help with that today.

LAURA: Oh. We could rest overnight, and you could pop them in in the morning?

MARISHA: What time is it?

LIAM: It's late. Sun's gone down.

TRAVIS: Super late. Yeah, and if they're from Westruun–

LAURA: Are you out of all your– oh, mist form.

MARISHA: Mist form got us here.

TALIESIN: It's worth talking to them at the very least.

TRAVIS: Yeah, Pike and I are from Westruun. If they're of that village, or that city, I'd like to make sure they're all right.

MARISHA: Maybe they're friends.

LAURA: Maybe we'd find Pike's grandfather.

TRAVIS: Grandfather Wilhelm.

LAURA: Percy, would Whitestone be able to sustain this many more people?

TALIESIN: I think at some point we're going to have to have that conversation, but for now I think we'll probably be all right.

TRAVIS: Yeah!

LAURA: All right.

TRAVIS: You're good for it. You're rich.

TALIESIN: For now.

LIAM: Here's an idea. Scanlan, you said that a lot of people can go into your house, yeah?

SAM: I can fit many people into my hole.

LIAM: Could you– (laughs)

MARISHA: I wonder why everything he says is creepy.

LIAM: Could you invite the folk in, and then they live in your hole for a little while, and then when we get to Whitestone, you open your hole and out they come?

SAM: No, not quite.

MARISHA: That's some cartel shit right there.

TRAVIS: Yeah. We become “Vox Machina: Coyotes.”

LIAM: Scanlan is the mule.

SAM: No, the house is mainly for us and a few guests, for one night at a time.

LAURA: You can't, like, leave them there.

LIAM: Didn't you say 100 people, the other day?

SAM: 100 servants are in there. I don't quite– I haven't jammed people in there. I don't know how many it can totally hold.

MARISHA: You mean, you've never thrown a party?

MATT: Go ahead and roll an intelligence check

SAM: First roll of the night: Natural 20!

(cheering)

SAM: Wasted it on an intelligence check.

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Smile upon us, dice gods!

MATT: Though the magic is new to you, you've spent in your first time casting it and a large part of the evening, especially since you realized you weren't going to have as fun a night as you thought, after the broom had been taken and Vex left your room, learning the intricacies of the spell itself and the pocket dimension that is created. You can fit quite a few people in there. However, it is stationary in its entrance and exit and then once the spell comes to completion after a 24-hour period, it expels anyone and anything that was brought into it, on the spot where it was originally cast.

LIAM: I see.

LAURA: Oh.

TRAVIS: Like gently, or like–

SAM: Like a flush.

TRAVIS: Like (sweetly) “Please leave.” or like (angry) “Get the fuck out!”

LIAM: Is that a yes or a no?

SAM: It's not a transporting-type spell. It is a temporary shelter, at best.

LIAM: You just don't want to bring them in.

SAM: I have a cold, cold heart.

(laughter)

SAM: Listen, I'll consider taking the females in.

TRAVIS: That is very noble of you.

LAURA: So noble, Scanlan.

TRAVIS: I will join him in this charity.

LAURA: Oh, yes.

MARISHA: Well, all right, why don't we just walk around and talk to these people? Maybe they're not even interested in being transported. Let's just find some citizens around.

LAURA: Should we make sure they're actually innocent, nice people?

MARISHA: We should probably do that as well, not like a band of thieves. Bandits.

LAURA: Stealth ahead.

TRAVIS: That could be fun.

LAURA: Can I sneak ahead and just listen to them?

SAM: Yes, sneaking up on them will definitely put them on our side.

LAURA: Hey, like 100 yards out. I just want to hear what they're saying.

SAM: All right, all right.

LIAM: She can read lips so she doesn't even get that close.

LAURA: It's pretty dark, though. But I do have good darkvision.

MATT: This is true. As the night takes over, it's still quite a distance to be able to make out a lot of detail. You'd probably have to get closer. But you're going alone?

TRAVIS: No, twins.

MATT: Twins going together?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Why don't you both roll a stealth check?

LIAM: Oh, I guess I'm going then.

TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye also, to see if anything– From a great distance, I'm just keeping an eye out.

LAURA: We're in the woods, right?

MATT: No. You are in the plains.

SAM: There are no woods, tall grasses

LAURA: Just kidding, we're in the grasslands.

LIAM: Grass, grass. 32.

TRAVIS: I'll roll this big bastard.

TALIESIN: White manna, not green manna.

LAURA: 18.

MATT: All right.

SAM: I'm hiding in a tree.

MATT: There's no– (annoyed hmm)

LAURA: There's no–

(laughter)

TRAVIS: “There's no (grumbles)”

SAM: The grass to me is like a tree

MATT: This is true, actually. It's more of a rose bush. So as you guys push forward, pushing and stalking through the grass, you come to about 40, 50 feet outside. And there's a little bit of chatter, it's hard to make out at this distance but the people seem to, not necessarily be jovial. Almost like they've accepted the circumstances and are just surviving it for the time being. There are a few individuals that are armed, though the armor itself seems patchwork, or you know, not the best or most trained of individuals currently guarding this group of survivors. But there are patrols going around, people keeping a close look, there are torches being lit now as people begin walking–

LAURA: Do we see anyone that we recognize from Westruun?

MATT: Not from this distance.

LAURA: No.

MATT: With your darkvision you can make out the outline of the very, very nearest individuals, the guards in particular. But at this distance, nobody catches your eye that you'd be able to make out much detail on, that you would recognize.

LIAM: Can we just sit for five or ten minutes?

LAURA: Well, the guards are coming through with torches, I don't want them to find us and think we're spies.

LIAM: But we are.

LAURA: Yeah, but I don't want them to think that.

LIAM: But we are.

LAURA: Yeah. I think you can stay 'cause you're more hidden than I am. I'm going to go back to the group.

LIAM: All right.

LAURA: I feel like they're going to see me.

LIAM: All right.

MATT: (chuckling) You don't know that. As far as you know, you're so hidden.

LAURA: “I'm so hidden.” Shit.

TRAVIS: Come on.

LAURA: All right, all right, all right. Just a second.

LIAM: I'm just going to stay here for a couple of minutes longer. Wait, you said they were coming our direction or they're just– ?

MATT: No, they're just wandering. Just patrolling

LAURA: Oh all right.

LIAM: You're paranoid!

LAURA: Okay, fine fine fine fine.

LIAM: Let me listen for a bit.

MATT: Okay. I'll have you both roll perception checks, if you could.

LIAM: All right. 22.

LAURA: 23.

MATT: Okay. You two, at about the same time, focus best you can. You have to scoot a little bit closer once the guard that's nearest to you passes by. You wait for your moment, scoot up close, get by one of the tents, and look off to the side. There are a few folks that catch your attention a little bit. There's one that was Elowen Brist, who was the mother of the first child that went missing in Westruun. You see her, with her daughter who's a little bit older now that you guys helped save her.

MARISHA: Oh my god.

LIAM: All these throwbacks are blowing my mind.

MATT: A little dirty but alive. They wander off. You scan through the crowd, keeping an eye out for the guard as well. No one really catches your attention. You see one older gentleman that walks by, 60s, not completely withered away. But, you know, older but carries himself with much importance. Very expensive clothing, reds and blues. It seems like he's attempting to hold a social station, even though in his current location, society has crumbled. He doesn't really catch your attention as anyone you recognize, but the person to the left of him is a very familiar-looking elven man, with long brown hair slicked over and behind his ears. This is Drez Vina, who originally contacted you when you arrived in Westruun.

LAURA: Holy– (whispers) That's Drez Vina!

LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

MATT: He's looking a little rough, too. This has not been the kindest time to any of these people.

LAURA: Well, should we go back to the group or tell them to come on in?

LIAM: Do we have to go back to tell them to come on in?

LAURA: We have earrings.

LIAM: Well, yeah, that's true

LAURA: (whispering) Hey, you guys.

TRAVIS: What?

SAM: What, what what what what?

LAURA: You guys! Hey Percy, pay attention.

TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, yes. Hello. What?

LAURA: Hey, guess who I'm looking at right now?

TALIESIN: Your brother.

LAURA: Well–

SAM: God, you're so good at that.

LAURA: Drez fucking Vina

MARISHA: (gasps) Drez!

SAM: Wait, remind us, who– ?

LAURA: Drez Vina was that dude that sent us on our very first mission together, you guys.

TALIESIN: Ooh.

MARISHA: Yeah! He protected us, he's a magic user.

SAM: Oh. I was mostly drunk that time.

LAURA: Yeah, Percy you weren't there yet.

TALIESIN: Oh, at the Winter's Crest festival, I remember.

MATT: (laughing) That's not him at all.

LIAM: No. He was– Drez Vina.

TRAVIS: “That's not it at all.” (chuckles)

LAURA: Percy, you weren't there–

MATT: That's Abjurist Noja.

MARISHA and TALIESIN: (in unison) Oh. Abjurist Noja.

LIAM: Drez Vina was the dick. Drez Vina's a dick.

LAURA: Drez Vina's the guy. Drez Vina was the asshole.

SAM: Doesn't he work for someone else?

MATT: He had a Master.

MARISHA: Wait, was he the guy that we stole from, kind of?

LAURA: Hey, keep it down. I don't know who all can hear over these earrings!

TRAVIS: Oh, did he have the tower with the magical items?

MATT: Here, I should step in here and clarify–

(laughter)

MARISHA: It's been like three years.

LIAM: This was only three years ago.

MATT: No, I know. Drez Vina came to you under the pretense that he was working for an individual called the Master, he called him his Master, who was interested in hiring your services. Originally sent you into the mage tower of Eskil Ryndarien, the Realmseer, to steal the brass box with the pearl top. However, you did not steal it and instead you ended up befriending the Archmage.

TRAVIS: He let us pick something.

MATT: Yes, he let you pick something from his array of items.

SAM: That's right!

MATT: Drez then found you guys at your inn, a number of weeks later. And Drez was very unhappy that you both didn't return with the item, and used a very powerful and expensive object that was part of this endeavor, and never paid it back. So, to pay back your debt, he sent you guys to the Druid Barrow where you had to retrieve this cortex, this magical gem that was embedded in the center of–

MARISHA: And that was where we fought the golem!

MATT: Yep. Where you fought the golem. And you retrieved the cortex successfully, and that's the last you've seen of him.

LAURA: See? He likes us now! We totally helped him.

SAM: But he has magical items–

LAURA: Well, maybe not anymore.

SAM: Had. Well, we should–

LIAM: What was, DM, can you remind me the name of the mother that we spoke to all that time ago?

LAURA: The one you just mentioned.

MATT: Elowen.

LIAM: Elowen? Elowen. I'd rather go talk to her.

MATT: I'm pretty sure, let me check my notes. Yeah, Elowen. Elowen Brist.

LAURA: Do you guys want to just come on in?

SAM: Yes, let's go in.

TALIESIN: I don't see what the harm is.

TRAVIS: We go in.

LAURA: Make a nice, pleasant chattering– maybe you should sing, Scanlan, as you approach so that people know we're nice

SAM: I would love to sing. Oh. Right now? (singing) Sunny days, chasing the dragons away, On our way to where the air is clean, Can you tell me how to kill, How to kill some drag-eens?

MATT: Go ahead and roll a performance check.

SAM: Performance check.

MATT: Yes.

LAURA: What is it? What is it?

SAM: It fell off the table. And it is– a six. But plus 13.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: Wait– plus 14.

MATT: Plus 14? Okay. Okay, so, as you guys begin strolling up, immediately you see torches (fire sounds).

LIAM: Hands up. No weapons.

MATT: You see guards come forward, two of them with nocked crossbows. “Who goes there?

LAURA: Hey, you guys!

MATT: And they don't really recognize– they're all looking at this source of singing. Crossbows–

SAM: (singing) It's a magic carpet ride. Except we burned our magic carpet so we can't–

(laughter)

MATT: The guards slowly drop their crossbows. “What's your business?”

TRAVIS: Hey, hey, that's not necessary. We're friends.

MATT: “We've already got enough mouths to feed. Move along.”

TRAVIS: No, we're not looking for food. We're here to provide aid if we can, if it's in need, if people need our help.

MATT: Make a persuasion check.

TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

SAM: Persuasion? You?

LAURA: Grog–

TRAVIS: Ten.

MATT: While their crossbows are notched, they haven't lowered them completely, they're still on guard and still nervous of your approach.

LIAM: We also think there's a woman with you named Elowen. She knows us. We'd like to speak to her. We'll wait here.

MATT: One of them glances over at the other one. One of the guards who was paying attention walks away and they all raise their crossbows again and just train them on you guys for the next few minutes.

TRAVIS: I mean, it's really not necessary. Even if you were to loose those, it would just be a tickle. I mean, trust me, we come from Westruun, all right?

LAURA: Don't you remember us? In Westruun?

TRAVIS: Yeah. Winter's Crest festival?

LAURA: Vox Machina?

TRAVIS: Grog? Pike? Wilhelm?

MATT: One of the guards takes a moment and gives you an eye and just goes– “I remember seeing you around town. You were– Oh man, jeez, it's good to see you.”

TRAVIS: Right? I'm as psyched about all this–

MATT: “Sorry if I gave you any trouble back in the day. I was young and stupid.”

SAM: Why don't you all lower your crossbows, for a second?

MATT: “I mean no offense, but we're very guarded with your kind at the moment.”

TRAVIS: (inhales) Right. Yeah, yeah, understandable. Right. We just actually came from Westruun. It seems to be a bit occupied at the moment.

MARISHA: And he's with us. So– He's not with them.

LAURA: He's different than the other guys, see? He's got a beard.

TRAVIS: No, I, listen. It came about my own. I just got the genetics for it. (stage-whispers) Would you shut up?

MATT: At which point the guard that had left comes back with Elowen. She walks up with her tightly braided reddish hair with a little bit of grey on the sides, that probably has come since the last time you've seen her and the experience of having her child gone so long. It's taken a physical toll on her. But there is a smile on her face. Now she looks over and focuses her eyes–

LIAM: Elowen!

MATT: “That's them! That's them! Let them in, let them in.” And she runs forward immediately and gives a big hug to you, Vex.

LAURA: Oh.

MATT: And starts moving through, and, you know, just this big smile and surprise. And you can see her little boy Simon come up to the side.

ALL: Oh! Simon!

MATT: Simon, who last time you saw, you were retrieving him from the pocket dimension that the Dread Emperor had called his domain. At which point, there's a few quick pleasantries, as she says hello again. She says: “Please, please come in. Please. It's fine. They're trustworthy.” And the guards nod. And they follow behind, not in an aggressive way but just in a being-careful kind of way. So you have two people, two armed individuals flanking you the entire walk that you guys are doing, but it's at ease.

MARISHA: Keyleth goes up to Simon.

MATT: “Hi!”

MARISHA: How old are you now?

MATT: “This many– ” He puts up nine fingers.

MARISHA: You've grown up so well.

MATT: “Thank you.”

MARISHA: And I just give him a big hug.

MATT: He freezes up. He's gotten a little shy at the interaction.

LIAM: I kneel down next to him and I say: do you want to see something cool? Look at this. And I take off the serpent belt. And– (snake hisses)

SAM: Oh, Jesus.

LIAM: And I put him around my neck. I named him after you.

(laughter)

MATT: “Really?”

LIAM: He's my pet. Do you want to, he's gentle as a lamb. Do you want to tickle his neck?

MATT: “Yes.”

(laughter)

LIAM: Yeah. Here, you hold him. I set it down around his neck. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen. It's fine.

MATT: He locks up again. Snakes and women have the same reaction to this poor little boy.

LIAM: Simon, fart in his ear. Go ahead and fart in his ear.

MATT: He gives you a stern look. And the snake just wraps around him for a second.

MARISHA: Keyleth does a little wind gust and goes (poof).

MATT: He goes (giggles) and starts laughing. Reaches up and rubs his ear from the tickle.

LIAM: It's good to see you again, kiddo. Come here, Simon Jr. I'll put him back, now.

MATT: He has a big smile on his face now. “That's so cool.”

LAURA: While that was happening, I pulled aside his mother. Is this everyone that made it out of Westruun?

MATT: (sighs) “Well, we're one group. Many went to Kymal, but they're at capacity now, and based on many of the farming fields that were destroyed or burned by the dragon ransacking, there's only so much food to go around, so they had to turn us away. But there were some small farming communities along the river that were kind enough to take us in and we're… we're getting by.”

LAURA: But you're searching for a home?

MATT: “Hoping to find out if anything takes care of the problems in Westruun. You should probably talk to Cornelius. I don't know the details of everything happening.”

LAURA: Cornelius. Is he the man I saw in the finer robes?

MATT: “No, no. Cornelius is rather– he's not very well-dressed. He–” And she scratches her head. “He used to be the bookbinder in Westruun but when everything fell apart, he rose up and took the lead in keeping everyone safe and so, I mean, he won't say it, but we kind of look to him as a leader for now.”

LAURA: Did he work in the Cobalt Reserve?

MATT: “I think he did business with them, but I don't think he worked directly with.”

LAURA: Oh, okay.

MATT: “Here. Let me take you.”

LAURA: Oh, wonderful.

MATT: She walks over and, as you guys are talking to Simon, she scoops Simon up and pulls him to her side and gives you guys a smile of acknowledgement. “Come,” and leads you guys–

LAURA: We're meeting Cornelius.

SAM: Okay.

TRAVIS: (softly) Who's Cornelius?

LAURA: He's a bookbinder.

TRAVIS: Never heard of him.

MATT: You guys are led through. Most of the folks stop what they're doing and pay attention. Some look wary and guarded. Others, you see their faces brighten up as they begin to connect the dots between the whispers they've heard of Vox Machina throughout the landscape and the individuals walking through. Most everyone seems to have a somewhat visceral emotional reaction once Grog passes by. It does catch you. You know, as a person who has always stuck out against the society as it was, and you've worked hard to a degree to get some respect, especially in that city. Having so many eyes on you, and you can feel the, while unearned from your standpoint, the heaps of hatred that are thrust upon you by how you look right now is uncomfortable. Eventually, the guards and Elowen bring you guys up to a central tent around what looks like a larger bonfire in the center where a lot of people are starting to bring their big nets of fish over and starting to divvy it out and set up small cooking arrangements so that people for the evening can have their dinner. She walks up to the edge of tent, speaks to one of the guards, mentions you guys and your wanting to talk to Cornelius. The guard leans in, shouts off to the side, “Cornelius, you've got some visitors. Is "that okay?” A voice muffles through, “That's fine. Go ahead and let them in.” The guard pulls open the tent, and at this point Elowen says, “I'm going to go get my son some food. If you need anything, just ask around.”

LIAM: We'll see you again.

MATT: “Thank you guys, again.” She rubs Simon's head and walks off. And as she walks off with him, he keeps looking over his shoulder at you the whole time, with a big smile on his face. You guys walk into the tent, and it smells like a tent that's been lived in for a couple weeks. The interior's not fancy by any means. It's blankets and burlap, and whatever functions to guard against the relatively muddy shores of the river. And you get a sense that most places here, just because of the landscape and how close it is to the river, mud is tracked everywhere. So it's mostly caked ground. There is a small cot on the far edge and there is a table set up and some elements of dried fish that are just being pulled from a sack on the side. And there are two guards, and you can see what appears to be Cornelius coming to greet you, as you enter. A man in his mid-40's, blondish hair with a scruffy, unkempt beard. You get the sense that he's a working man. His hands look calloused. He's got a layer of just dirt and grime across his brow that tells you he's definitely one who gets in the thick of it when it's needed. And you can see why in this circumstance people put trust into a person that can rise up amongst all the chaos from simple means and prove themselves to want to help everybody. And in the moment he smiles, you immediately see also why people follow him. He's got this bright, toothy, white smile, and he puts his hand out immediately to each of you. “Pleasure to meet you. I'm Cornelius.”

LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

MATT: “So, I'm told that you all are here to talk to me? What's this about?”

SAM: We know that you've been driven out of your homes by an attack of dragon or dragons. How many have menaced your city?

MATT: “Well, counts all say that we have upwards of three dragons that came through here and tore into this city and– They were gone for a while, and we'd hoped they weren't going to return, but that's when–” He kinda looks over to you, Grog. “That's when the savages came in and took what was left. And I mean no offense to that. I recognize you; I've seen you around the town before. You seem like you're not like your ilk.”

TRAVIS: No. No, I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

MATT: “That's okay. No one really knows who I am and I want to keep it that way, when all this blows over.”

TRAVIS: Understandable.

MATT: “Don't like all the attention.”

TALIESIN: How long have you been nomadic for?

MATT: “We're going into our second week now, I think. We sent a few of our most able-bodied up north in hopes of trying to figure out if the city was safe to return to, and, well, only a few made it back, and those that did said it was a bloodbath.”

LAURA: It's quite dangerous there right now.

MATT: “Yeah.”

TRAVIS: How many do you have here, in your encampment with you?

MATT: “Let's see.” He kind of takes a moment to think and does couple marks on the dirt in front of him to do a count. You can see he's not a very numbers-guided person.

TRAVIS: I like him.

(laughter)

MATT: “I'd say we got probably about close to 60, 70 people left. We used to have more. Then we lost the scouting parties up north and, well, these past four days we've had a few of these orcish fuckers been raiding the outskirts of our camp every night and taking goods, people–”

MARISHA: What's your current destination?

MATT: “Hah, we got none. We're just staying here and staying alive.”

MARISHA: And what made you camp out here?

MATT: “Fish, mainly. I mean, all the farming grounds are destroyed or they're being guarded currently, and there's no space for us in Kymal. We can keep going east, but–”

TRAVIS: If I could be selfish for a moment. Have you seen Wilhand? Pike, Pike Trickfoot. Her grandfather.

LAURA: A small, older gnome?

MATT: “We got a few older gnomes from the city. I don't think we have any among us though, no.”

TRAVIS: Fine. Thought I'd ask.

LIAM: If we could help you relocate quite a ways away, would you be open to that?

MATT: “How do you mean?”

LAURA: There's a city. A lot of the refugees from other cities that have been destroyed by the dragons are finding their way there and–

MARISHA: Percy actually has family who's in charge there.

LAURA: We could give you safe passage.

TALIESIN: Possibly find you someplace to work.

LAURA: Very quick, safe passage.

MARISHA: Can they account for 70 extra people in Whitestone?

TALIESIN: We lost a lot during the attack with the Briarwoods.

MARISHA: Right.

TALIESIN: There's room, but there's only– We can maybe make room for a few more.

LAURA: There's farmland, there are some empty buildings.

MATT: “I appreciate the offer, and–”

MARISHA: It hasn't been touched by dragons yet.

MATT: “Hah. 'Yet.'”

MARISHA: Yet.

MATT: “I tell you what. We greatly appreciate the offer, and we're liable to take you up on that at some point in the near future. But right now, we have too many of our people that are unaccounted for to the south. We got a couple scouting groups who're trying to find out where these orcs are, where they've taken them. See if we can retrieve our own before we go ahead and find a new place to live.”

SAM: How many are missing right now?

MATT: “Well, we lost 11 in the last few nights of exchange, to blade, and we've lost about nine to the actual bands themselves, so. There's nine unaccounted for. We're hoping–”

SAM: If we found them, would you be more likely to take your people to somewhere safe?

MARISHA: And what is necessarily stopping you from at least sending a handful of women and children ahead? Families that don't need to be nomadic.

MATT: “Do you have the means to keep them safe for that kind of travel? That's a long way, up to Whitestone. We don't have the guards to keep them up on that.”

LAURA: We have very safe means of travel.

TALIESIN: A shortcut, one would say.

MARISHA: They'd be there in an instant.

MATT: “I don't know anything about any of that weird magic stuff, but you seem like a reliable group.”

LIAM: You can tell we're a motley bunch of assholes. We've seen shit and we've done shit and we can do shit.

MATT: “Ain't that the truth. Well–”

TALIESIN: We'd also like to talk to you, perhaps, to see if you've seen some shit. We're actually looking for something out here.

LAURA: Oh.

LIAM: Are we?

TALIESIN: We are. Well, you've been traveling, we're looking for a creature who may have what we need to help defeat these dragons.

LAURA: Possibly a bit deeper into the Frostweald.

MATT: “Into the Frostweald?”

TALIESIN: Yes.

MATT: “That's where we're thinking our scouts are saying these orcs are holed up, anyway.”

LAURA: Really?

TALIESIN: That's useful.

MATT: “At least, that's where we've been sending our folk. And follow them out there. Only one group went in after them and they never came back, so–”

MARISHA: No one's returned who's come back?

MATT: “Oh, we've gotten one group that came back. That's how we know they're there. But they were just a scouting party. They got to the outskirts and came back.”

MARISHA: Can we speak to them?

MATT: “I think they're out right now, actually. Going to get more information. Sorry.”

TALIESIN: Well, that works out well, then. We can go up that direction, perhaps take care of this problem, possibly.

LAURA: Yes.

TALIESIN: It's on the way.

TRAVIS: I wouldn't mind a good stretch.

LAURA: Kill some orc.

TALIESIN: I could use some breathing.

MARISHA: Do you know your way around the Frostweald at all?

MATT: “Can't say I do. But I do have some stake in this personally, if you don't mind me asking. We don't have much to offer you, at all, really, other than my gratitude. Tell of a few friends of ours that've found their way wherever these savage creatures are stationed. One of the individuals that was taken in a raid two nights ago was my brother, Cyrus. Don't know if he's still amongst the living, but if you are indeed planning on taking a look at where these orcs are and bring folks back safe, if you could just keep an eye out for him?”

LIAM: Well, I'll tell you, in times like these, it will feel good to be able to do a bit of good.

TALIESIN: Hear, hear.

LAURA: What does your brother look like?

MATT: “He's about 15 years younger than me. Shaggy brown hair, bit of a puffy goatee. He looks like a lazy man. He is a lazy man, but I love him. If you're looking for someone who's hiding in the corner, shaking in their boots, it's probably him.”

LAURA: Understood.

TRAVIS: Check the corners.

MATT: “It's his defense mechanism.”

LAURA: (laughs) A very safe one.

MATT: “I hope.” His eyes go a little colder at that moment. “I hope.”

LAURA: Well, we've been to the Frostweald before. I'm not afraid to go in there again.

MARISHA: No.

TALIESIN: I say we take the evening to rest, and first thing in the morning, head out.

LAURA: Would there be any injured members of your camp that would want to head out in the morning to Whitestone? Somebody that needs any medical attention?

MATT: “We've got plenty of folks who aren't feeling too well. Illness and disease, unfortunately, tend to go hand-in-hand with these type of nomadic lifestyles. We can probably– about seven or eight people that could use some relatively immediate attention. Couple survivors of the recent raids. If you can indeed do this, you might be saving some lives, here.”

MARISHA: Are we camping the rest of the night?

TALIESIN: Yes.

LIAM: That's wise.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we promise you no one will bother you tonight.

MARISHA: Question. Question. Can I do my Transport via Plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot level?

MATT: Nope.

MARISHA: That's what I thought.

MATT: It would say it next to the spell. Ritual.

MARISHA: That's what I thought. Okay. Keyleth spends the rest of the evening burning up my remainder spell slots to do curing on those who need it.

MATT: Okay. You guys are given a relatively ramshackle tent in which you can sleep for the evening, cooked fish– that's about all they have to offer– with a few leftover potatoes that appear to have been recently either located amongst their remaining crates, you have no idea, but a passable meal is presented if you'd like, and a place that has cloth over your head.

TRAVIS: No, I don't need to sleep tonight. I'll be on the watch.

SAM: Boy.

(laughter)

LAURA: Should we scour the camp for her grandfather?

TALIESIN: I'm sleeping tonight. I don't know what's wrong with him.

LAURA: I know he said there were no gnomes, but–

TRAVIS: There's only 60 people. I feel like he'd know with 60.

LAURA: Yeah.

TRAVIS: That's like this many, like–

LIAM: And it's not a lot of gnomes. I'm assuming it's a handful of gnomes.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: Right. I just, I don't know. I wish Pike were here.

TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

LIAM: Always wish Pike was here.

MATT: You do recall, last time you were in Whitestone, you left the other half of your gatestone with Pike.

TALIESIN: I'll write a letter.

MARISHA: We'll write a letter.

TALIESIN: I'll write a letter that will travel with them to Whitestone and–

SAM: Oh.

MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea.

LAURA: That's wonderful, and she can pop over.

TALIESIN: Mm-hm. Take about a minute.

TRAVIS: Really?

MARISHA: Yeah.

SAM: Wait, we'd have to send them tonight, though.

TALIESIN: No, in the morning.

LAURA: They could go in the morning and just go find her immediately.

MARISHA: Yeah, could task someone to find her immediately and then, as soon as she gets the message, she'll beam to us.

SAM: All right.

LIAM: I've still got the other one. Right here.

TRAVIS: Great. We take the night, then.

LAURA: All right.

TALIESIN: I write a letter to my sister, letting her know that I do apologize that we're sending more people, but it's necessary, and I write her a letter insisting that Pike be sent here by stone immediately.

MATT: Okay.

LIAM: (singing) D-E-A-R C-A-S-S, how are you? I'm fine.

LAURA: What the fuck are you singing?

TALIESIN: (singing) Everybody else is too!

LIAM: Wow! You know what I'm doing!

TRAVIS: Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?

LAURA: What was that?

TALIESIN: You are a nerd!

LIAM: A theatre nerd, yeah.

TALIESIN: Yeah, you are a theatre nerd.

LAURA: Wow.

LIAM: Secret Garden, ladies and gentlemen.

TALIESIN: Secret Garden: The Musical. It's magical.

LIAM: Can we have the break so Taliesin and I can go make out in the other room?

MATT: Don't go on break for that! Just move your seating arrangement.

TALIESIN: And suddenly the YouTube hits just go through the roof.

(laughter)

SAM: What injured people are going back? Have we met these people yet? Can we meet them?

MATT: You haven't met them, no.

LAURA: Let's go find the injured.

MATT: You guys are led with Keyleth as well. There are two armed guards that are hobbling their way through their patrols tonight as they've been wounded in the previous orc raid that happened the couple nights beforehand. There are a number of just relatively sick people. Couple of children. Whether it be having to eat whatever was around to stay alive but some of the food had spoiled in travel, or just catching disease as when you have clusters of people in cold environments, especially cold, wet environments like this tonight. It does tend to happen. Nothing seriously life-threatening, but, you know, definitely worrisome.

SAM: I try to find the one who's the most able-bodied. Right? We're going to need someone to go find Pike or deliver a message, right?

LAURA: Yes.

TALIESIN: It's going to be whoever's organizing it.

SAM: Is someone going who's not injured to transport these people?

MATT: Possibly. And you can organize whoever you'd like. Someone you know, you could bring along.

MARISHA: Well, I start attending to the children first.

MATT: Okay. So you tend to the children, helping them feel comfortable, deal with any wounds, scrapes, relative inconveniences, and it's easy enough for you to take a moment to cure disease if need be.

LAURA: Can we find any families with children and maybe see if there's able bodies in there that we could send through?

MATT: Okay. Yeah, you manage to– and with Elowen and her son Simon as well–

LAURA: Yes. Maybe Elowen could go?

TALIESIN: Elowen would be perfect.

MARISHA: Well, remember, we were able to get about 25 or so people through last time with the spell.

LAURA: How many sick people are there?

MATT: You see about seven or eight people that could use it.

LAURA: Perfect.

MATT: So you can get a bunch of other folks through as well.

MARISHA: Okay.

LAURA: I talk to Elowen and ask if she can go find Pike in the morning, if she wants to go through, and all that kind of stuff.

MATT: “I'd be happy to, I–”

SAM: You remember what Pike looks like?

MATT: “Yeah. About your size, lightish hair–”

SAM: Hair the color of the sunset, eyes like waves that crash in the night, breasts, supple, firm–

TRAVIS: Okay, Scanlan. Scanlan.

ASHLEY: True, true, true.

(laughter)

MATT: “Right. Yes, I remember. I'll find her, yes.”

SAM: Smell of morning dew as it touches–

MATT: She begins to cover Simon's ears.

(laughter)

MATT: “All right, I think we should turn in for the evening, but yes, I'll be happy to take care of it.”

LIAM: Also of note, you're going to be going through a tree.

MATT: “What?”

LIAM: Just go with it. You're going to be–

MARISHA: Well, you know, you didn't have to tell them that now. Could've just let it be a surprise.

LAURA: It's really fun, actually.

LIAM: It's kind of frightening, though, if you don't know it's coming.

LAURA: You'll pop right out in Whitestone. It's amazing.

LIAM: It's still a little weird for me, to be honest.

MARISHA: Is it? Okay, that's good to know.

MATT: “All right. All right.” So, as the evening comes to completion, you're taking guard for the course of the evening.

LAURA: I pop Trinket out and I sleep on him.

TRAVIS: Very attentive.

MATT: (bear sound) He curls up.

LAURA: Hugs and hugs.

MATT: Yeah. Warm, fuzzy. Trinket makes for a very good bed for one.

LAURA: Yes.

LIAM: I'm going to curl into the butt end, which is all I get. All I ever got while we were traveling.

LAURA: Yeah. He farts on you all the time.

LIAM: I fart on him all the time.

MATT: It's just a fart exchange. Back and forth, forever.

LIAM: Bada-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang.

MATT: (laughs) That got weird. Did you want to do anything for the evening?

TRAVIS: No.

MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

SAM: Oh boy.

LIAM: Oh crud. Big two!

TRAVIS: Big watch, big watch. Nine!

LAURA: Ey-oh!

LIAM: Ey-oh! (exploding sounds)

MATT: Okay. All right. The evening goes by without a hitch.

(groans)

LAURA: What would you have seen? What would you have seen?

MATT: You all come to consciousness. You eventually get your rest as well for the evening.

MARISHA: What didn't you see? Tell me what you didn't see.

MATT: At this point, the tent city is back to a bustling sound of folks going about their business for the day, what kind of business that can be done. The people that you've requested be sent over to Whitestone have been gathered on the outside, the western side of this small city area, and some of the guards there are prepared to greet you in preparation for sending these people over.

SAM: Keyleth, before we do this, there are no trees here.

MARISHA: What? What do you mean? Are there trees here?

MATT: No. It's a plain. I mean, there are the occasional small tree, scattered in clusters around, but you're in the grasslands.

MARISHA: I thought we were on the edge of a forest.

SAM: There's no forest here.

MATT: The forest is south of you guys.

LAURA: We've got to walk them to the forest.

MARISHA: How fucking far are trees?

MATT: I'd say, probably–

SAM: Four days' journey.

MATT: No, from this area, it's most of a day's travel. There are trees closer, but the forest is that far.

MARISHA: I just need a tree to fit people through. I need a person-width tree.

SAM: A giant tree.

MATT: To find a tree large enough to do this is probably going to be about two hours' walking distance.

LAURA: Okay, we can walk for two hours.

MARISHA: That's a nice morning hike.

LAURA: You know what, I'm going to fly up. I'm going to (hacking spit) and fly up and find a fucking tree.

SAM: Oh, you're going to scout?

LAURA: I'm going to scout for a tree.

MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a perception check.

TRAVIS: Why did you pick that as the word?

LAURA: I didn't think about it. I forgot.

TALIESIN: That was a great decision.

LAURA: 23.

MATT: 23. You find, actually, hiding just around the bend of a series of small hills that butt up against the southwestern side of the Foramere Basin, there is a small cluster of trees, one of which is the largest of the group, that may function as a function of this that is only about a 30-minute walk from these.

MARISHA: That's doable. There we go.

LAURA: Fly back down and I tell them. I look along the path, though, and make sure it's safe, the walking back. Is it okay?

MATT: Yeah.

LIAM: Hopefully nobody saw the comely half-elf flying through the bright blue sky.

LAURA: I wear turquoise to blend in with the blue surroundings.

MATT: You didn't blend in too well, as when you crested over, a number of the families and kids that were prepared were pointing up. “Mom, she's flying!” People were excited to see you take off into the distance. It was quite a display. Well done.

LAURA: I do some circles around and wave.

LIAM: Maybe you can join Dr. Dranzel in the circus.

LAURA: I hang off of it as I come down, like woo! And then come back up.

MATT: Go ahead and roll a dexterity check.

LAURA: Dexterity or acrobatics?

MATT: Dexterity.

LAURA: Damn it.

TRAVIS: Outstanding.

LAURA: I said as I come down. It was low. I was low.

MATT: So as Vex takes a moment to do some unique tricks with her elaborate and long-running experience directing brooms across the sky, she gets a bit cocky and does a “look, ma, no hands” moment. However, in doing so, the broom sputters out from under the grasp of her legs, and suddenly goes limp as it begins to fall almost as fast as you are, as you both begin to plummet.

LAURA: I grab for it! And (hacking spit) as I'm grabbing for it.

LIAM: You can't fight the power of the one.

MATT: Unfortunately, you don't have any momentum to go forward, and it's already coasted about 15, 20 feet away from you, and there's nowhere to swim. All the kids are like, “Yay!” Cheering, and all of a sudden you start falling, and they go (screaming). And starts yelling.

TALIESIN: Which child in the crowd is going to become Robin? I'm so excited.

MATT: I want you to go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.

TALIESIN: This is how we make a vigilante.

LAURA: Okay, okay. 25.

MATT: 25, okay. So you only suffer nine points of falling damage as you hit the ground and do a tumble, land arms out and catch the broom, smiling amongst the serious pain in your legs and back.

LAURA: I'll bet you thought I was really falling!

MATT: All the kids are like, “Yay!” And start cheering, clapping. Even the parents start clapping. The guards start clapping, like, “That was genuinely impressive.” Played it off.

TRAVIS: Blood trickles out of the ear from the brain trauma.

(laughter)

SAM: Does the broom just fall, or does it shoot off like a missile?

MATT: It shoots off for a second, carrying the momentum of the propulsion, and then it falls limp as it no longer has the immediate connection with the person. But she did catch it after she tumbled.

SAM: Oh, okay, that's cool.

TALIESIN: Working on it.

LAURA: I'm going to work on that trick, you guys, and it's going to be amazing.

TALIESIN: I think it's perfect.

LIAM: Blood for the blood gods.

MATT: All right. Finding the tree, you guys walk, and bringing the families and the children and the people that were chosen to go to Whitestone, Keyleth, you create your Transport via Plants spell. (whoosh) The doorway opens, and it barely fits onto this one half-dead willow that's cresting the side there. Everyone (gasps).

MARISHA: We form the line, the ranks.

LIAM: Climb through, climb through, you have to move quickly.

MARISHA: Go, go, go, go!

MATT: At the very end, Elowen's the last one through, and she's holding the letter and she looks back and says, “Promise,” and leaps through right as it closes in the tree. You look toward the guards that were with you guys, who are just watching this whole thing with their eyes wide open.

TRAVIS: Glad you let us in, aren't you?

MATT: “Yeah.”

MARISHA: I turn to him and I go, high five! Okay.

MATT: At this point, you see two figures walking towards you at this southern forest.

SAM: Two figures walking towards us?

MATT: Towards you guys, rather hastily.

SAM: I draw my whip.

MATT: Okay. Whip's out. You glance over and, easy enough to see, it is Drez Vina and this older individual, both rushing up. Drez has his hand up. “Excuse me, I'm sorry, pardon me!”

TALIESIN: Yes, hello? Hello?

MATT: “It has been some time, everyone. Pleasure to see you again.”

LAURA: We remember, dear.

MATT: “Wondrous, wondrous. I'm here with–” And as he gestures, the old man puts his hand in front and goes, “Would you please just let me talk for once? Hello. I am–” And he looks over. “Has he been giving you my– I am Master Quall. Pleasure to meet all of you.”

SAM: Quall?

MATT: “I was the collector that had hired you in previous times as Drez has recently made me aware, and while our track record has been spotty, you seem to be rather able-bodied, and whispers this morning that have come to my ears mention that you have interest in returning to Westruun. Is that correct?”

SAM: To set it free, yes.

MATT: “Wondrous, wondrous.” He looks over to Drez. Drez goes, “Yes, well, you see, the master here lives within Westruun, and– ” “I'm talking, I've got this. My abode, which is a relatively humble structure, two stories, bricks and dark wood, southeast of the town square, right by the fountain crossroads, I'm sure you've seen it before. Since this whole endeavor has happened, it has usurped a bit of progress in my experimentation, and I would be remiss if I didn't request your assistance in perhaps retrieving a very important piece of my collection so I might continue this research in this desolate place.”

LIAM: What are the subjects of your experimentation?

MATT: “Various things. I enjoy finding out the base elements of existence and life.”

LAURA: Insight check.

MATT: Insight check.

LAURA: He's lying. 18.

MATT: 18.

TALIESIN: God damn it.

TRAVIS: Whispers!

SAM: Dagger Dagger Dagger is one of the shirts that's available. There's Strongjaw Ale. Strongjaw Ale available for sale. Check it out. Geek and Sundry.

TALIESIN: That's very interesting. Did you know that I'm a collector as well, actually?

MATT: “Really? Oh, quaint.”

TALIESIN: Of specifics.

MATT: “Of what?”

TALIESIN: Specifics. I see that you have not really handed any over.

MATT: “It may be a bit beyond your understanding.”

LAURA: Very few things are beyond his understanding.

MATT: “Very well. I appreciate the synergies between various elements and the ability to link the essence with that of a living organic entity, or the transition of such living essence into what is normally non-living matter.”

MARISHA: So you're a necromancer.

MATT: “No! I don't deal with that ridiculous stuff.”

TALIESIN: He's talking about transmutation of some kind.

MATT: “Yes, yes! Thank you. The transitioning of essences or sparking essence within what was once non-living matter. I'm talking about elements, I'm not talking about flesh.”

MARISHA: Like natural elements?

LAURA: Like golems.

TALIESIN: It's the veganism of necromancy. It's just kind of dull.

MATT: “What was that?”

TALIESIN: Nothing.

MATT: “Now, I had previously asked you to retrieve an item in the past. That was part of this research and I was nearing a breakthrough, I believe. However, if you could find your way into this abode and retrieve for me– It's in the basement, amongst my work desk area. It's a simple dark iron and cobalt circlet. A band, if you will. If you could retrieve that for me, I would make it quite worth your while and be ever-grateful and in your service.”

LIAM: What are we talking about, a pile of coin, or something else?

MATT: “As I said before, I am quite the collector, and while I do hate to relinquish my grasp on various parts of this collection, for someone who does me a grand favor, I am willing to look the other way as one might disappear.”

LAURA: What does the circlet do?

MATT: “It's more of an experimental piece.”

LIAM: Come on. Don't treat us like a bunch of fucking assholes. It's in the middle of shit right now. We're not going to go in there for a trinket. It's obviously something very worthwhile. You would have a better chance with us if you're honest.

MATT: Drez at this point steps forward and goes, “I would appreciate if you respected the master for his research. He is going to offer you a great guide.”

MARISHA: Oh, shut up, Drez.

LIAM: Yeah, you're an asshole. You're the biggest asshole. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.

MATT: “Sir, perhaps we need to–” At which point he looks over and the master's like (cackling). “About time someone called you on it.”

SAM: Master Quall. We're looking for the Vestiges of Divergence.

LAURA: Scanlan, what the fuck?

SAM: Oh, am I not supposed to say that? Do you know where those are? That's what we want. If you can offer us one of those, we'll do business with you. Otherwise, we're going to fuck off.

MARISHA: Wait, he might. Look, Master Quall. Finish what you were saying first.

MATT: “Yes. I've heard of this title before. You say you're seeking them, are you?”

SAM: I am. Not them.

MATT: “Where are you seeking these? Whereabouts are you off to?”

MARISHA: Well, we were headed towards–

SAM: We don't know where they are.

LAURA: They're all sorts of different places. We're trying to figure that out right now. We're not exactly sure. We're not exactly sure, Keyleth.

SAM: We thought you might know.

MARISHA: How is what we're seeking less important than where we're seeking it? I'm really confused.

TRAVIS: Oh, you know, just in case we mention where we might be looking for them, in front of these people.

LAURA: Because what if he goes to find them?

MATT: “Don't worry.”

MARISHA: Does he look like the man capable of going and finding things? He's trying to send us back into his own god damn basement to get his own shit.

MATT: “See, there is a woman who speaks both her mind and a mind of quite acute truth.”

SAM: She is cute.

LAURA: Is it morning yet? Can Pike come join us yet?

SAM: She is being sought.

MATT: As you guys are having this conversation, there's a little (crackling) flash of divine energy before you, and a slight popping sound as out of the middle of the air next to you, there comes, jogging in, a freshly winded, fully armored Pike.

SAM: What an entrance!

TALIESIN: See, you start arguing and you just make a gnome. This is what happens.

TRAVIS: I run over and I pick up Pike and I spin her around in a big bear hug.

ASHLEY: Hey, Grog!

TRAVIS: Oh, my little buddy Pike. We missed you.

ASHLEY: Oh, I missed you guys.

MARISHA: Hi, Pike!

ASHLEY: Hey guys! Oh, who are these two?

MATT: At this point, Master Quall is going through a series of notes. He goes, “I'm very certain this gnome was not created.”

MARISHA: And you remember Drez.

ASHLEY: Oh, yes. Mr. Vina. Drez Vina.

MATT: “Yes. It is a delight to see you as well, small one.”

ASHLEY: Hi!

MATT: “Well, this grew very complicated.”

TALIESIN: Master Quall.

MATT: “Yes.”

TALIESIN: Let's lay the cards on the table. If we find this thing of yours in your basement, and if we go to your home, we are certainly going to go into the basement and find it now regardless, we're going to figure out what it is before we give it to you anyway. The world is dangerous right now, and it is not appropriate to just be handing mystical artifacts of great strength willy-nilly to anybody who asks. The world is dangerous and we need to make sure that power is flowing in the correct direction. Now, you can either be forthright with that and get your property, or we can find it in your basement and experiment on it until we know what it is.

MATT: “Good luck even attempting such an endeavor.”

TALIESIN: I have very good luck attempting these endeavors.

MATT: “Well. Let's just say that it's a device that, when completed, to the specialty of my own training and studies, would enable me the means of personal defense to get me through these rather difficult and dangerous times. As I am not getting any younger and it seems that we're having entities of great power and mischief intent on destruction continuously tearing down my very doorways–” He looks off in the direction of Westruun. “I would feel more comfortable if I could keep myself well guarded. And that is what this circlet is intended to provide.”

LAURA: Tell you what, Master Quall.

MATT: “Yes?”

LAURA: We're not heading there now, but we'll be going back, and when we do, we will find your home, and we will search out this circlet.

SAM: Well, hold on, before we just say no, what's the reward? Do we know what you're paying for this?

TALIESIN: Well, he's got a collection.

MATT: “A simple trade of my collection. You bring me one of my items, and I gift you one of mine as well.”

TALIESIN: I personally feel this is reasonable.

MARISHA: I'm curious if you could be more beneficial in paying us with information. With knowledge.

LAURA: As well as something from your collection.

MATT: “I am more than willing to offer information for trade. It is quite a grand trade indeed. If that is acceptable.”

LAURA: No, we would want something as well, physically.

TALIESIN: This is a deposit of information.

MATT: “All right. Then, as part of the deposit, what do you require of me?”

MARISHA: Are you familiar with a sphinx named Osysa?

MATT: “Can't say that I am.”

MARISHA: Resides up– No?

TALIESIN: What does he know, perhaps, of the– no?

MARISHA: Are you familiar with any other sphinxes that reside in this area? Do you know the address?

MATT: “I'm sorry, but they don't really wander in open daylight.”

LAURA: Do you know where they wander?

TALIESIN: In darkness, if they don't wander in open daylight.

MATT: He gives a curious look at both of you. “I am not a master of mythology. I do not know of such entities and where they might reside or exist. I apologize.”

MARISHA: Well, you do seem to be a master of items. We are looking for certain special Vestiges.

MATT: “So you say. And you're saying this sphinx may want to help you in this endeavor?”

MARISHA: We're not sure yet.

TALIESIN: It's a long walk.

MARISHA: We thought maybe he could help us find them, but maybe you could be of a similar service.

MATT: “Well. What I do have–” And he turns around. “Come with me to my tent, please. I may have something that can be of service to you.”

MARISHA: Sure.

LAURA: I give Pike a hug as we walk to his tent.

SAM: Actually, I pull Pike aside and say– Well, not aside. I just ask her, how's Whitestone? What's going on there?

ASHLEY: Well, it's okay. I think I got to the point where I couldn't build anymore, heal any more people. I needed a little adventure. But everything is as you would think it would be.

SAM: No dragon attacks?

ASHLEY: None at the moment. We've been trying to hold down the place as much as we can, and getting there seems to be okay.

LIAM: I did not go up to Pike. I hung way the fuck back.

MATT: All right. You guys eventually make your way back to the small outpost, at this point, to the tent of Drez Vina and Master Quall. Master Quall steps inside. You hear him rummaging through some things. Something rolls and breaks, and you hear, “Oh, damn it!” from the inside. He comes back out and goes, “All right, so, this.” And he holds up this small glass bauble. The inside has a spinning, looks like a brass gyroscope-type interior. He goes, “This item, when clasped and concentrated on, should light up any sort of nearby magical incantations or enchantments. This, if you are in the presence of such objects as you are seeking, should be quite helpful in locating their presence. It does not have an incredibly long range, but it should, at the very least, be somewhat helpful.”

LAURA: That's pretty cool.

SAM: You're giving this to us?

MATT: “I'm lending it to you. Should you wish this to be part of the trade instead of something from my collection…”

LAURA: No no no. Lending is–

TALIESIN: Lending is perfectly agreeable.

MATT: “Now I have lent you something in the past, and not only did it not return to me, but I had to extract the funds by forcing another contract on you. Can I trust you to complete this endeavor?”

SAM: You can trust us, as far as Grog can throw me.

TRAVIS: Pretty fucking far.

TALIESIN: You can trust her.

MATT: “Deal.” And he hands it out.

TRAVIS: We will make our way into the city, and when we do, we will look for your items.

MATT: “Thank you. I appreciate that.”

SAM: Or we could just send Vex on a broom right now to get it solo–

MARISHA: Wait, what? What?

TALIESIN: We are not flying a half-elf into the city on a broom that she has already fallen off of in the last 24 hours.

LIAM: Archers!

LAURA: I am recovering a bit right now, but thank you for the wonderful, wonderful idea, Scanlan!

SAM: I think you can do it. I think you can do it.

LAURA: Thank you! I appreciate the vote of confidence.

LIAM: He is a tactician.

MARISHA: Hey, what might this item be called, Sir Quall?

MATT: “I haven't named it, actually. I made it for myself. Call it what you like.”

SAM: How about “The Hunk of Quall”?

MARISHA: The Hunk of Quall.

MATT: “Should you wish, certainly.”

TALIESIN: Didn't we had a conversation about letting him name things? I feel like we had this conversation.

TRAVIS: Always do it, right?

MATT: “Enjoy carrying among yourselves The Hunk of Quall.”

TRAVIS: Thank you. Drez Vina, it hasn't been a pleasure, nice to see you.

MATT: Drez crosses his arms, “Indeed. All right, good luck.”

TRAVIS: And can I take Pike around the shoulder and lead her out of the tent?

MATT: Yeah.

TRAVIS: Hey, hey… hey, Pike?

ASHLEY: Yeah?

TRAVIS: So I'm glad things have been good at Whitestone. They've been good, yeah?

ASHLEY: Yeah, they've been all right, I mean, it's okay, I've been missing you guys, though.

TRAVIS: Yeah, we miss you a whole lot. Listen, I've got some rough news, actually. We made it back to Westruun, and the city has kind of been ransacked and overtaken. It was attacked by a bunch of dragons, and what's worse is that after it was attacked– you know that herd of wandering goliaths that left me for dead in the woods?

ASHLEY: Of course.

TRAVIS: Yeah, they've kind of taken control of the city, and I think that's my family that's in there.

ASHLEY: Oh no.

TRAVIS: Yeah. Look, we wanted to go in, I wanted to look for Wilhand, but we haven't done it yet, and–

ASHLEY: Have you heard anything else? Do you think they are okay?

TRAVIS: I don't know. Some of us went in via mist and they haven't seen him, but they don't really know what he looks like. The place looks pretty rough, he's not here in this little encampment. I'm not really sure where he is.

ASHLEY: Okay. Well, I wonder if we should go look for him

TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to, but like, listen. I'm afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy. They're going to be there, in the city, and I was wondering what you might think about going to look for a few other more Vestiges, trying to find Osysa's mate and seeing if we can find anything that can help us, because it's going to be a fight, right? And you know me: I fucking love a fight, but–

ASHLEY: That's a lot of them.

TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a lot.

ASHLEY: I think we should wait until we're fully prepared.

TRAVIS: Yeah, you think so?

ASHLEY: I think so. I don't think it's safe any other way.

TRAVIS: I missed you so much!

ASHLEY: Oh Grog, I missed you too!

TRAVIS: And I cry a little bit into my beard, and I wipe it away I'm like: Oh! The pollen out in these fields is awful!

(laughter)

ASHLEY: It's okay, Grog! I give him a hug, and I take my blue scarf and I pat his eyes.

ALL: Oh!

TRAVIS: (crying) It's raining!

(laughter)

TRAVIS: As soon as we find this out, if we find nothing– I promise, I pledge to you that we will find Wilhand.

ASHLEY: Okay.

TRAVIS: All right.

MATT: All right.

SAM: So, is the task then to go find the orcs that are keeping their people hostage up in the Frostweald?

LAURA: We head into the Frostweald, we find the orcs and send them back and keep going and find this Sphinx-y mate.

MARISHA: Did we have any other information of where he is in the Frostweald or do we just know Frostweald?

LAURA: We just know Frostweald. Pike?

MATT: The information that you received was, somewhere in the base of the Stormcrest Mountains, past the Frostweald.

MARISHA: Past the Frostweald?

LIAM: Through it to the base of the mountain.

LAURA: Of the what mountain?

MATT: Stormcrest Mountains.

LIAM: That's a real place.

TRAVIS: Actually, Pike.

ASHLEY: Yeah?

TRAVIS: I've been holding on to something, and I think you might like it. I have these Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and I can't wear them anymore, because I got some new stuff, and if you wear it, your strength score goes up to 19.

ASHLEY: What!

TRAVIS: Do you want them? You have to attune to them.

ASHLEY: Do you think they'll fit?

TRAVIS: I think they might shrink. I don't know, though.

TALIESIN: Do you know what 19 means?

TRAVIS: Isn't it like a French dish?

LAURA: Yes.

ASHLEY: I would love to wear those.

TRAVIS: All right, and I give Pike the Gauntlets of Ogre Power.

MATT: As you guys take a short rest to prepare for this, Ashley, you take some time with the gauntlets, and while you're looking them over and taking your own armored gauntlets off and replacing them with these, your hand goes– It's like placing a baseball into a bucket. It's so big around your arm. But then as you take a moment to see the metal and reflect upon it, you can feel the hum of magical energy that begins to invisibly intertwine with your forearm as the metal begins to creak almost, and it shrinks down, encases itself to your forearm. While it doesn't match the metal of your armor, the silver-gold theme that goes on along it with this weird ogreish face that's built into the plate there, you feel suddenly this surge of strength begin to spill through your body, and you're pretty confident that this may be useful in the near future.

LAURA: You're stronger than Grog now!

MATT: You are technically now stronger than Grog.

ASHLEY: I let out a little battle cry. (battle cry)

TRAVIS: Yeah, and I go to give her a fist bump.

ASHLEY: I fist bump him!

MATT: And it hurts you a little bit.

LAURA: Oh, shit! Pike is so strong!

TRAVIS: Holy shit. Nice, Pike!

MATT: Pike, what was your strength before?

ASHLEY: 13.

MATT: Okay. At a 19, you're now at a plus four as opposed to a plus one to all your hit and damage with your physical weapons.

LIAM: You just Tyler Durden-ed out, son!

MATT: So on your sheet, where it has your attack bonus with your mace, or with your morningstar, and the damage, add a plus three to both the attack bonus and damage.

ASHLEY: All right, because right now my attack bonus is plus seven, so I add three to that.

MATT: It's now plus ten.

LAURA: Holy moley!

MARISHA: That's so cool! You're a beast!

LIAM: Little golden bullet.

ASHLEY: I can't find a pencil! That's okay, I'll make a note. I can do it later. I am unprepared. Yes, I am unprepared for all this strength!

TRAVIS: Right, so now we have all our stuff. Should we make our way towards that area they said that the orc raiders were coming from?

SAM: Yeah, it's a couple days from here?

MATT: On foot travel, it's about a day and a half.

SAM: For mist form?

MATT: Mist form, you'll get there by nightfall.

LAURA: But we can't use it, because she already used the travel through the trees.

MARISHA: Sorry.

LAURA: But we saved all those people, Scanlan.

SAM: Pike, can you make us mist?

ASHLEY: No, I can't do anything like that.

SAM: All right.

LAURA: Let's walk.

ASHLEY: I feel like I haven't spent any time with Vax.

SAM: With Vax? Oh, he's around. You know, he's probably just sulking.

LIAM: I walk away.

MATT: You glance back and see Vax towards the back of the group. Noticing this conversation, Vax immediately turns around and walks away and dodges around one of the nearby tents.

LIAM: Big nope to that one.

TRAVIS: What is the weather like outside?

MATT: Actually, today it's spotty clouds, but blue sky. It's actually pretty good weather, versus a lot of the rain that you had over in Vasselheim.

TRAVIS: Cold, snowy on the ground?

MATT: No. Because you're getting a little further south than the northern area of it, the temperature is probably around high 70s, low 80s.

LAURA: It is going to get cold, though, once we head into the Frostweald. We had all those fancy cloaks. I had winter's cloaks for all of us before.

TRAVIS: I still have mine.

LAURA: Does everyone still have their winter's cloaks from a long time ago?

MARISHA: I do.

TALIESIN: Oh, wow, yes, look at that.

SAM: I didn't burn it.

TRAVIS: Let's go.

SAM: We're just going to walk? Do these refugees have any horses or anything?

LAURA: They're refugees.

MATT: The few horses they do have are currently quartered to wagons and look to be more beasts of burden for, if they have to move, to carry most of their goods with them, as opposed to riding horses.

TRAVIS: Come on, man, let's just hoof it.

SAM: All right, we'll walk.

MARISHA: Oh my gosh, are we walking? We haven't walked anywhere in so long.

LIAM: It's like we're back in New York again.

MARISHA: It's like we're level three again.

MATT: And those horses will survive, because you didn't take them.

TRAVIS: Oh, that's fucked up.

LAURA: That's really sad.

TRAVIS: Take a walk. Save a horse.

MATT: That's a good Vox Machina bumper sticker.

TALIESIN: My other horse is walking.

TRAVIS: Coming to the Geek and Sundry store.

MATT: All right. You guys make your Fellowship trek southward with the sweeping camera drone shot.

LAURA: I constantly keep an eye out for anything in the front of us and behind us.

MATT: Thankfully, most of these fields, of varying degrees of grass height, but for the most part it's pretty wide vision of where you're heading.

MARISHA: I paint pictures in the clouds as we go.

LAURA: Oh, that's good. That'll definitely not let anyone know magical people are on their way.

TALIESIN: Just point arrows in the opposite direction.

TRAVIS: Graffiti as we go.

ASHLEY: Can I insight-check Vax?

MATT: Sure. Roll an insight check.

ASHLEY: Natural 20.

MATT: I believe you.

MARISHA: This never happens.

SAM: You just saw all of his dirty dreams.

MATT: What does she see and read on your face and body language, Vax?

LIAM: I got to say this?

MATT: I can say it, if you want to.

LIAM: I don't want these assholes to know what I'm thinking. I don't know. Can't whisper it to her.

MATT: You can text it to her real fast, if you want.

LIAM: Yeah, I'll text it to you.

LAURA: But put it on Twitter so that everybody else knows what it is.

LIAM: No.

ASHLEY: I'll post it.

MATT: Okay, so you'll have an incoming text of information. As you guys continue walking, these are the observations you make of Vax as you travel southward. You travel for the better part of a day. You get quite a bit south. You do see in the distance a few times what appear to be some pack animals, some larger beasts that roam the land, none that are necessarily aggressive unless you encroach upon their territory, and Keyleth, you have experience with some of these beasts, so you manage to keep people at bay and traverse around what they claim as their own landscape. No terrible detriment to your traveling speed. You make your way to the point where the sun goes down. You can stop and camp for the night or you can push through the evening. What do you wish to do?

MARISHA: Are there any trees nearby?

MATT: Little periods here, little tiny groves that might be spotty along your journey, but for the most part it's open fields.

MARISHA: How much further do we have, do you think?

MATT: One more day. One more eight-hour period of travel.

LAURA: We should probably rest, then, right? We'll be hitting the Frostweald at night tomorrow.

TALIESIN: We're not in a rush.

LAURA: Not anymore. The dragons are bunkered down, I believe.

TALIESIN: Everything we do now is measured in weeks and months and not days.

LAURA: And I still have a little dried blood on the outside of my ear. I could use a bit of rest.

TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, do you have a concussion? Is that something that we can– how many fingers am I holding up?

LAURA: You're really blurry, Percy, I have no idea.

TRAVIS: Nine!

MATT: Save versus brain swelling. Are you guys setting up camp?

LAURA: I want to pull my brother aside when we set up camp.

SAM: Do we want camp, or do you want to sleep in a mansion?

LAURA: Pike hasn't seen your beautiful mansion!

MARISHA: Oh, you have to show her the marble floors.

TALIESIN: Do we want to do it now, or do we want to do it tomorrow night, is the question?

SAM: We can do it both.

LAURA: Oh, that's right– We can do it both nights?

SAM: I can do it every day, right?

ASHLEY: Where do you have a mansion?

LAURA: Scanlan has a mansion, Pike!

SAM: I inherited some money. It's a long story. There was a great-uncle Vesuvius.

TALIESIN: Also known as Uncle Touchy. Uncle No-No.

LIAM: Canon, that's canon.

SAM: The court said that he had to give me– No. We'll sleep in the mansion tonight, and they all know where they're sleeping, but I'll personally show Pike to her chambers, which are right next door to mine at the end of the long hallway. My room, obviously, the biggest, tallest. Pike's a close second. Beautiful, covered in yellow rose petals as far as you can see.

MATT: So, Pike, as Scanlan creates this somewhat shimmering door of mystical energy in the middle of the air off of the path you guys have been walking, in the middle of this field. It's just the open grass that's blowing with this gentle night breeze, a little bit of the moonlight is coming through the clouds, giving enough of a visual of this change in the air space. He pushes open the shimmering door, and on the inside is this beautiful mansion. Tall foyer with marble floors, pillars that raise to the ceiling with gold trim. There's a giant portrait in the center of the main stairway now that has both Scanlan and you on horseback over a beautiful landscape. There are a number of mystical servants that are somewhat transparent and spiritual, arcane energy in form, that take your coats and offer food. A delicious meal is presented for all of you.

SAM: Mostly chicken.

MATT: It's mostly chicken. It's a lot of chicken.

LAURA: I'm having a lot of talk with the servants about different ways to prepare food.

SAM: Please do.

TALIESIN: They keep clucking it up.

MATT: Protein, bro! Scanlan does lead you to your room, which is right next to his, and covered in yellow rose petals, a beautiful interior. The color scheme is marked tailored specifically to your tastes that he's been able to glean from conversations with you over the past couple years.

SAM: Blues, silvers. There's a little mini prayer area for her to pray to Sarenrae, and there's a little statue of Sarenrae, and if you pull it, a little secret door opens to my room. But it's a small door that only a gnome could fit through.

ASHLEY: Oh, great! Is there a lock on that, maybe?

(laughter)

SAM: Only on my side.

ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, this is beautiful, Scanlan!

SAM: I did it for you. And, hey, while we have a moment alone, can I just mention something to you? Listen, I'm not really concerned with other people's vices or bad behaviors, but Grog has this sword, and it's sort of not good. It could be used for good, possibly, but I'm just worried about it. Just keep an eye on it. I don't know what it is, and maybe you could just check it out next time you're friending it up with him.

ASHLEY: Okay. When they had that fight with Percy, up in the house, I felt like there was something weird with that sword. I'll check it out.

SAM: I don't want to judge him or what he does, but just make sure that it won't kill any of us. That's all I care about.

ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a good plan. Okay, I will. Thanks, Scanlan.

SAM: Sleep tight. And if you hear any footsteps in your room, it's not me. It's the servants, I assure you.

LAURA: Can I find– Is there a library in the mansion, Scanlan?

SAM: Of course.

LAURA: Can I pull my brother into a library or something? I just want to talk to you.

LIAM: What? What?

LAURA: Okay, weirdo. I couldn't help but notice, anywhere Pike was, you were not, all day today, and I have a feeling it's because–

LIAM: You want to talk?

LAURA: Yes. I do. Don't walk away from me, please. I have a feeling it's because of this Raven Queen situation. I don't know. I know that you offered yourself to her to save me, and I can't put into words how much that means to me. I'm worried that she took you up on the offer, and I know you're worried about it, too. And I'm afraid that's why you're avoiding Pike. You're afraid she's going to see something in you. But I wanted to tell you, I've been looking through this book. It's the best 35 gold I've ever spent. Maybe it was 30 gold, I don't even remember anymore.

LIAM: It was 30.

LAURA: It was 30! It would have been worth 35 for all the things that I found in it! Look, it's got all this information about the Raven Queen, and I've been looking at it all the time. I don't think she's as horrible as you're afraid she is. Can I tell you what I found?

LIAM: Yes, please.

LAURA: It says that those that follow her must hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life. That's not bad. Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it. Bring down those who try to cast off the chains of fate. The Raven Queen represents death, right? Therefore she hates those that live an immortal life. She hates vampires! We hate vampires! They're terrible people, right? That's not bad! Watch for the cult of Orcus, and stamp them out whenever they arise. Orcus is bad. If she hates him, then she must not be that terrible.

LIAM: She's already speaking to me.

LAURA: Oh. And?

LIAM: I don't know, Vex'ahlia. I don't know what this means. I know that she's not a force for evil. Neither are funeral homes. I don't want to bed down in one.

LAURA: Well, that's understandable.

LIAM: But it doesn't matter. And I'd do it again, because I did it for you, and I am trying to come to terms with it, not knowing the terms.

LAURA: Well. We've lived half our life in the shadows. You've made them your home. Am I right?

LIAM: Maybe so.

LAURA: This is a time you can either let those shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a hole, or you can use them to your advantage. You can become a champion. It's pretty fucking badass, if you ask me.

LIAM: Do you know how bad this armor smells?

LAURA: I can smell it, actually. Pretty terrible.

LIAM: It's several centuries old. It's not pleasant.

LAURA: Maybe we can get you some oils or something to put on it.

LIAM: Maybe.

LAURA: What I'm saying is, brother, I'm proud of you, and I'm happy for you, and I'm so, so thankful for you. And you don't need to be frightened! This is a wonderful thing. Not many fucking people can say they're a champion of a fucking god.

LIAM: Listen. I'll take what you say under consideration. Again, none of us, you and I don't know what this means. I'm waiting to see.

LAURA: All right. But as someone who's seen the other side and has come back thanks to you, there's no use living your life in fear. I love my reckless brother, as much as he hurts my heart. I love you for that, and don't be afraid to be that.

LIAM: I have no clever answer to give you.

LAURA: That's wonderful. I love you. And I walk away!

(laughter)

LIAM: I go to bed.

TALIESIN: Before Scanlan disappears, I grab him as he's leaving.

SAM: I'm just making the rounds, make sure everyone's tucked in for the night.

LIAM: Scanlan's like, wasn't looking in on Pike. Wasn't looking in on Pike.

TALIESIN: Have you, perhaps, installed some sort of workspace in this wonderful home of yours for me? I've got a few little projects I want to poke at.

SAM: You mean the all-purpose room?

LAURA: The Room of Requirement?

TALIESIN: I'm a little worried by what all-purpose necessarily means.

SAM: Don't look in there with a black light.

TALIESIN: It's not really a work table, is it?

LIAM: It is the danger room.

SAM: It's all purposes, Percy. All purposes. But yes, it is a private room. No one can hear you scream in there. It's the farthest wing we have. I can give you some servants to help you set something up, bring in some tables, whatever. We don't have much in here, we're not prepared for chemical reactions.

TALIESIN: Nothing complicated, just some very basic blacksmithing and a little bit of leatherwork.

SAM: Do I have that stuff? Anything to help him?

MATT: Yeah. If it was prepared within the house.

SAM: I tried to make enough stuff for all of us to have our basic needs met.

TALIESIN: I can think of some very sexy things that can be done with an anvil. Think about it.

SAM: All my anvils are gnome-sized.

TALIESIN: That's comical.

MARISHA: Keyleth pops her head out into the hallway. Did I hear something about working? Are you working?

TALIESIN: Yes. Scanlan's helping me find a room that apparently is so sound-proof we don't actually have to hear anyone else's drama.

MARISHA: Oh, that's fantastic.

TALIESIN: I know. Grab a book. It'll be fun.

MARISHA: I might join you.

SAM: Are you going to have a working dinner? I'll send some chickens down.

MARISHA: I can't sleep, so, yes.

TRAVIS: What about cows?

TALIESIN: No cows in my room either, please.

MARISHA: I join Percy and help him.

MATT: Okay. You guys find the all-purpose room, which does have the basics required for smithing. The smithing gear that is brought to you by the servants in itself is very, very finely crafted and nearly weightless. It's really impressive, and you look at the label, and it has a small timer on it before it becomes immaterial.

TALIESIN: I can work with materials that are in the Bag of Holding, that are real materials, as long as I put them back in the Bag of Holding and take them with me? I can't leave anything, obviously.

MATT: Yeah. Anything you leave in here will just be spat out.

TALIESIN: Oh, it'll just be spat out. That's lovely.

MATT: Yeah, onto the ground where it was.

TALIESIN: For the moment, because I don't have everything I need for the broom yet, I want to work on a piece of jewelry, if that's okay. I want to work on the thing.

MATT: Work on jewelry?

TALIESIN: I want to construct a little piece of jewelry if that's okay. Not magical.

MATT: Do you have a jeweler's kit?

TALIESIN: Do I have a jeweler's kit?

MATT: It's a whole different skill set, man.

TALIESIN: I can't tinker something?

MATT: You can tinker something, but jewelry is different from tinkering.

TALIESIN: No, well, this is a piece that has purpose. It actually is going to be a functional object.

MATT: What is the function of this object? You need to tell me these things.

TALIESIN: I know. This is something that I– I'm so sorry.

MATT: I'm going to make something! Make me roll for it! I got to know what you're doing.

TALIESIN: I want to make a– I'm so sorry, I'm losing the word.

MARISHA: Hey, Percy, what are you trying to make?

TALIESIN: Something that's too complicated to explain to you. I'm blanking on it. I may have to just give you the name at the break. A little herb pouch, like one of those cages that close up to put herbs in them?

SAM: Oh, like you make tea with?

MATT: Okay. It won't be pretty, but you can make it functional. Yeah, go ahead and make a tinkering check.

TALIESIN: All right, I'll make it pretty later.

LIAM: Like a Shoprite bag with a bunch of shit in it?

MATT: This will be a dexterity mod, because it's not a very complicated piece based on what you've constructed in the past. It's more about your ability to make it work.

TALIESIN: Dexterity? Thank god, because that's a terrible roll. 14.

MATT: 14. Okay, it takes you the better part of the night.

MARISHA: Do I assist him at all?

MATT: With a job this small, there's not a whole lot you can assist with except handing him tools.

TALIESIN: I'm not going to run the whole night. At some point I'm going to be like, I don't have the design yet. This is something I want to get right, so this is going to be working towards it.

MATT: Okay, so you get the first stage of that set and ready to go.

TALIESIN: I can't think of the name of what it is. I'm so embarrassed.

MATT: You all eventually find yourselves to rest, tasks completed to the extent of which you wanted to, conversations finished. You find yourselves at breakfast, a delightful spread of breakfast chickens prepared for you.

MARISHA: I pick one up off the table and I say, hey Vex! (whoosh)

LAURA: Shit! I'm not even on my– (grunt)

MATT: All of you duck instinctively as the chicken has enough time to arc and begin to plummet down before she gets her arrow out, and you see her aiming downward as it falls. As she releases the arrow, it manages to catch it. Go ahead and roll for an attack, see how well it hits.

LAURA: Oh, that's good. 30?

MATT: (arrow impact)

LAURA: Oh, wait, 28, 28.

MATT: (slightly quieter arrow impact) It pins the chicken to the wall, and then it just sags. The wooden shaft slowly snaps under the weight of the chicken before it hits the ground. One of the servants scoops it up and sets it back on the table in front of Keyleth with the broken arrow shaft sticking out.

MARISHA: I like that game. It's my new favorite game.

LIAM: Do you want some more broom target practice?

LAURA: I need to practice with this broom.

LIAM: You do need to practice, seriously.

MARISHA: We have more chickens.

TRAVIS: We've got stuff to do.

LAURA: Yeah, we have stuff to do.

LIAM: I'm still eating. I would love to see you, for five minutes, get up on that broom and fly around and fucking put some arrows in some chickens.

LAURA: All right, fine, I'll fucking practice. Does it help me at all to practice on this broom?

LIAM: It helps me.

SAM: I will command seven servants to each have a loaded chicken at the ready.

LIAM: Pull!

LAURA: I start flying.

SAM: Vax, you can do the honors and say the pulls.

LAURA: I clench really hard with my thighs to try to hold on to this broom.

MATT: As the rest of you enjoy what is the strangest of Medieval Times experiences you've had, glancing upward to the raised ceiling of this dining room area, you watch Vex spiral around on her broom before, Scanlan?

SAM: Vax is saying pull.

LIAM: Pull!

TALIESIN: (chicken clucking)

MATT: Roll, with disadvantage.

LAURA: Oh, Jesus. Okay.

TRAVIS: Say it. Say it!

LAURA: One!

TALIESIN: Easiest number to count to.

MATT: So as the first chicken goes in the air, she reaches and goes to aim. However, she catches herself. The broom throws her off, and she stops just in time and haphazardly focuses on just the chicken, not realizing where the chicken had now fallen past. Releases it. Scanlan, I want you to make a dexterity saving throw.

SAM: Nine.

MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

LAURA: Okay, that's not that bad. Damage? Oh, it's automatic hit?

MATT: Yeah.

LAURA: Okay. Oh, no.

LIAM: Full damage.

LAURA: That's 17.

MATT: So, Scanlan, as you're watching this, chewing, suddenly, (impact).

SAM: (screaming)

LAURA: Shit! Scanlan, Scanlan, I'm so sorry! I land, I land. I land and I instantly cast Cure Wounds on him. Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

MATT: A big old chicken dangling at the end of the arrow.

LAURA: Pike! Pike, help, help, help, help!

TRAVIS: I'm just applauding. Again! Again! I pick up my chicken and I throw it at Scanlan.

TALIESIN: Does this mean when the night's over there's going to be a little pool of blood where the door was?

MATT: You'll find out. Go ahead and roll for healing.

LAURA: Oh, God, okay.

MATT: As Vex reaches out and grasps you and manages to heal some of your wounds.

LAURA: Oh, good, that's good. It's just 1d8, do I add anything?

MATT: 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

LAURA: 11.

MATT: So you heal 11 hit points.

SAM: Can I pull out the arrow?

MATT: Sure. A gout of blood sprays out.

LAURA: I hold my hand there. Pike, can you help?

ASHLEY: I'll help, I'll help. That broom is amazing!

MARISHA: Isn't it, Pike?

ASHLEY: Yes! And there are too many chickens in here, anyway. Healing Scanlan.

MATT: Pike, you're just casting a Cure Wounds?

ASHLEY: Yes, I'll cast Cure Wounds.

MATT: The wound closes as Pike reaches out and, with a small chuckle, heals how many hit points?

LIAM: The chicken comes back to life!

ASHLEY: What did you say, Matt?

MATT: How much do you heal? Roll 1d8 plus five, I'm pretty sure. That was amazing.

LAURA: Sorry, Scanlan. You can blame my brother.

ASHLEY: Nine.

SAM: I'm back.

MATT: You're back to full. The wounds close. Pike's there holding her hands on your shoulders, closing the wound.

SAM: Thank you, Pike.

ASHLEY: You're welcome.

SAM: All right. Well, let's say breakfast is over.

LAURA: I'm going to practice a bit more, you guys.

MATT: The other servants are holding their chickens at the ready.

SAM: Pull.

MARISHA: Go, go, go!

ASHLEY: Can I try punching one in the air with my new gauntlets?

MATT: Okay. As he's about to throw it up, Pike runs over and grabs the chicken and throws it and (boom) punches it in the air. Pike, roll a strength check. Roll a d20 and add plus four to it.

LIAM: 20 chicken McNuggets fly through the air.

ASHLEY: This is so dumb, why am I doing this? What am I doing?

MATT: Roll a d20, add four to it.

LIAM: For the greater good.

ASHLEY: Okay, it's not that high. 11.

MATT: 11, okay. You (boom) bat it up with a Pike punch. We'll say for the sake of brevity on this, go ahead and roll one more attack, and this will count for the rest of the shots. With disadvantage.

LAURA: Oh, come on. 16.

MATT: 16, okay. You do manage to recover your sense of self-esteem as you manage to pin a couple more chickens against the walls and the table in here, but each arrow is just a reminder of the one stray that began this whole breakfast excursion.

LAURA: Sorry about that, Scanlan.

SAM: Great job, Vex.

MARISHA: Guys, this is the best brunch we've ever done.

LIAM: I will never forget it.

MARISHA: That was great. Thank you for that, Scanlan.

SAM: Sure, sure.

LAURA: We should probably get a start on a walk.

MARISHA: Yeah, so, question, before we leave, you guys–

TALIESIN: This is going to make the archery booth at Ren Faire hilarious. Sorry, okay. Carry on.

MARISHA: Do we want to travel via Wind Walk, or are we okay?

SAM: We're only eight hours away?

TALIESIN: It's only eight hours. Save your strength.

MARISHA: Because I can save my strength.

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, save it.

MARISHA: Okay. All right. Thank you.

LAURA: We might come across some orcs.

MARISHA: That's true.

TRAVIS: Hopefully. Shit.

LAURA: I know, right? I could use some.

SAM: All right, let's set out.

MATT: You guys say good-bye to your servants, gather yourselves as you step out and the door closes behind you. Do you choose to leave the spell up, or are you going to fade it as you walk along?

SAM: If I leave it up, can anyone go in there?

MATT: Anyone that you allow into it.

TALIESIN: I want to see if the blood comes out.

SAM: No, I'll shut the door and hide the key under a rock.

MATT: Okay. You guys continue walking southward towards the Frostweald. About another seven to eight hours of travel along that way, you begin to see the Stormcrest Mountains in the distance get closer and loom larger and larger, and you get the feel of the Stormcrest Mountains especially because there is a very large storm surge that seems to rise from the ocean to the east of it that has caused a very heavy thunderstorm that's blasting through. You can't see the peaks of the mountains from this distance. There are clusters of trees and forest areas along, but ahead of you, you can see, coated in a very, very bright, visibly white forest, this is the Frostweald itself, with snowfall. Once again, you've been here before, and there is an essence, and you don't recall the specific reason for it, but there is a purpose, an ancient purpose, as to why this one area is perpetually sitting in the heart of winter. Amongst what is a relatively temperate, in some places almost tropical temperature layer, it is very strange, and part of the mystical calling to the Frostweald is that it is perpetually locked in a winter state. You– don't worry, I'm working on it.

MARISHA: Keyleth takes a second to meditate on the previous time that we were here in the Frostweald, and I cast Find the Path. 6th-level spell. Which gives me the most direct, shortest route as long as I'm on the same plane existence of where I'm going, if I have a vague idea of where I'm going.

MATT: Where are you going?

SAM: We're going to the Stormcrest Mountains, right?

MARISHA: We're trying to get to the Stormcrest Mountains through, but we're also looking for the band of orcs travelling.

MATT: If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves, or a destination that isn't specific, such as a green dragon's lair, the spell fails.

MARISHA: But we're in the Frostweald, right?

MATT: Yes. You're approaching it now.

MARISHA: Is the Frostweald considered on a different plane?

MATT: No. But do you have a specific location that you're familiar with that you want to go to?

MARISHA: Well, I can find us the shortest, most direct route to the Stormcrest Mountains.

SAM: Have we been there?

MATT: Yeah, you can see them. I'm trying to figure out. For the spell to work, you have to choose a specific location that you're already familiar with to lead you to it.

MARISHA: Right.

MATT: So what are you saying?

MARISHA: Stormcrest Mountains. But just because I can see them doesn't necessarily mean we're going to find the most direct path, shortest direct path towards it.

MATT: That's true.

MARISHA: Right? Or is this a waste of a spell and I should just do something else?

MATT: I will give you the benefit to say that you can see the mountain range. This is more useful if it's trying to find a place that you're very familiar with, seen a picture of, or you had a very specific bit of information for it. For a general location or a location that you're unaware of, the spell wouldn't have an effect.

LAURA: Maybe you could think of the location of her mate, the sphinx's mate.

MARISHA: I don't know it, so it fails. That's why I was trying to do Stormcrest Mountains, but apparently that's not specific enough.

LAURA: Well, is it specific? It's just we can see them.

LIAM: Yeah, it's right there.

MATT: It's a large range that's very visible.

LIAM: Let's move on, let's move on.

MARISHA: I'll do something else.

TALIESIN: Save it for something special.

MATT: So as you guys press forward to the outside of the Frostweald, the snow- and ice-covered treeline is a very familiar sight from your last time traveling here. There are canopies of pine-like trees that interlock with windless snowfall, that leave a fairly dark interior set from the frozen-over canopy. Slick surfaces and knee-deep snowbanks permeate this entire forest region. Your breath is immediately visible as you step past that threshold, and the temperature drops about 40 degrees from what it was before, getting steadily colder the further in you travel.

LAURA: Bet you're glad you have that beard now, huh? Keeps you warm? No?

TRAVIS: It's actually quite nice out here. This is like spring for me.

LIAM: Are your people– Did you grow up in the cold?

TRAVIS: Yeah, we're pretty cool.

LIAM: Wow.

MATT: Pressing in, as the temperature drops further and further, you occasionally come across a broken sunbeam that manages to penetrate aspects, different places in the canopy, and even stepping into those, they don't lend any change in temperature or warmth. The enchantment that surrounds this entire forest doesn't seem to be moved by such natural incursions. Everyone go ahead and roll a perception check.

LAURA: 25. Are we in the woods? 29.

TRAVIS: Two.

MARISHA: 18.

TALIESIN: 15.

SAM: 20.

ASHLEY: 25.

MATT: As you guys are walking through, keeping your eyes peeled, Vax, you're so lost in thought that your eyes glaze over for a second and you forget where you are. Pike and Vex, the two of you get a little bit ahead of the rest of the group, pushing through the snow. You come around from a tree and you can see, this is about an hour or so into your entrance to the Frostweald, you see a small clearing with a few patchy trees outside of the heavy canopy, and what appears to be a couple of small stone ruins and a single obelisk, a monolith-like pillar of stone that juts out of the snow. It's about 200 feet away from you guys, 250 feet.

LAURA: Can we see anything around it? Any people, any trace of tracks in the snow?

MATT: From this distance, no. You don't see any, there are no figures, there is no movement. There is just that stone piece that, at a slight angle, stands out amongst the rest of the treeline.

TRAVIS: What do you see?

LAURA: There's a, look. There's a fucking obelisk. It's a tall stone thing, Grog.

TRAVIS: Yeah? So?

SAM: Let's go over.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

TALIESIN: Vex, you and I should hang back, but we'll let everyone else.

MARISHA: It's a big obelisk? Are there any birds or anything like that around?

MATT: Listening, that's what's interesting. Usually forests, because they're teeming with so much life, there's a perpetual sound of things that live amongst the boughs and the treeline. Because it's so cold here, it's eerily silent. Every footfall that hits the snow, you can hear the crunch resounding and echoing through the nearby vicinity. It is just a still, silent atmosphere in this forest.

LAURA: (clanging) Pike!

TRAVIS: Let me check if it's safe to move on. And I reach down and scoop up a handful of snow, right? Just snow? How's it taste?

MATT: It's the clearest snow you've tasted in a long time.

TRAVIS: Shit's crazy pure, yo.

SAM: So then we're safe to move ahead?

TRAVIS: Yeah, we're good. Let's go check out the scary obelisk.

LIAM: Everybody starts inhaling snow.

MATT: Are you moving ahead, Grog?

TRAVIS: I'm moving ahead. Who wants to come with me to the obelisk?

LAURA: I'm going to hide behind a tree and watch.

LIAM: To the what? What obelisk?

TRAVIS: For what? Why are you hiding?

LAURA: I'm just going to keep guard!

MARISHA: I'll come with you, Grog.

TRAVIS: There's nobody out here.

TALIESIN: I've had bad luck touching things lately. I'm letting other people touch things.

MATT: Grog, Keyleth.

SAM: Pike's coming.

MATT: So Grog, Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan are all going forward. Looks like Vex, Vax, and Percy are staying.

TALIESIN: I'm getting another angle so that we have two different vantage points of what may happen.

LAURA: Getting a little closer, but keeping.

MATT: Are you going with Percy?

LIAM: I'm brainfarting, so I'm just following Percy.

MATT: Okay. Percy and Vax splinter off to the left, Vex you go ahead and take the right, and you head around this clearing while the rest of you walk into the center of it.

TALIESIN: We're keeping an eye on that thing in the–

LIAM: Look at that!

TALIESIN: I know, it's a thing. We're going to let Grog touch it and see what happens.

MATT: You guys approach, and as you're stepping through the snowfall, which right now is, for you, up to just past your knees, like the grass was. For Keyleth it's just up to your waist. Scanlan, you and Pike are both (grunting) like the dogs jumping through the snow that vanish with each leap as you're having to find your way through this heavy snowfall.

TRAVIS: Do you guys want a ride?

SAM: Yes, please.

TRAVIS: I pick up each gnome on my shoulders.

ASHLEY: Thanks, Grog!

TRAVIS: No problem!

MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check as you guys approach this obelisk.

SAM: 25.

TRAVIS: It's a two, minus three.

MARISHA: 11.

MATT: What did you get, Pike?

ASHLEY: 14.

MATT: 14, okay. So as you guys approach, from this vantage point, it's carved, definitely, and the carving is very old. Weathered somewhat, but not too heavily, so it's either not very old or there's not a whole lot of weather that comes through here, and by the stillness of the wind since you've entered, you get the feeling that's probably more the case. It's hard to gauge how old or how long it's been here. But there are various carvings amongst it. There is a big symbol. I want to have you guys roll a religion check real fast.

TRAVIS: Awesome. What the fuck. Natural one.

LAURA: You need to not use that dice right now.

SAM: 12.

MARISHA: Religion? Nine.

MATT: Pike?

ASHLEY: 15.

MATT: 15, okay. It looks familiar, but you're having a hard time really getting the essence. Pike, you recognize this. This is not the largely understood or most commonly utilized symbol of Ioun, but it is a very ancient, the basis of the religion of Ioun, which is the same goddess of knowledge that Osysa was overseeing the temple beneath.

ASHLEY: Wait, how do you spell it?

MATT: Ioun. I-O-U-N. You actually carry a stone, enchanted with the essence of Ioun's knowledge.

SAM: Oh, that's my Ion Stone! Ioun Stone!

TRAVIS: Is it made of, it's stone?

MATT: It's solid, solid stone, and goes up about 35 feet or so.

TRAVIS: Hey, Scanlan, I heard if you touch your tongue to something like this, it'll stick.

SAM: Wow. Wow, we should probably try that out. Keyleth?

MARISHA: What?

SAM: Can you go lick that obelisk?

MARISHA: Hell no.

TRAVIS: Why not?

MARISHA: I know that one. But you should do it, Grog. I can't do it, just because of my elven abilities. It's our saliva, it doesn't work the same way. But you should try it, it's crazy.

TALIESIN: Keyleth, that was very clever.

SAM: How far are we?

MATT: You guys are about ten feet from it.

SAM: I'm going to just look around it for any traps.

MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

SAM: 18.

MATT: 18, okay. You have to leap off Grog and start wading through. You're finding pieces of broken stone, smaller chunks about that big and bits of stone dust that are scattered amongst the snow. You push around, because you see the ruined walls around. You do find a larger piece of stone that looks like a broken statue, like there must have been some sort of a statue here that had lost the hand, and it's stumbled there on the ground.

MARISHA: Upon him seeing that, I pull out my Hunk of Quall and see if it lights up.

SAM: Oh, you have to concentrate on it.

TALIESIN: Are there orcs present?

MATT: (laughs)

TALIESIN: I knew someone would laugh at that.

MATT: You hold it aloft. It has a small vibration of energy, as part of the crystal sliver itself, but it doesn't seem to change in the environment.

MARISHA: Can I move a little bit closer to the obelisk?

MATT: As you're stepping closer to the obelisk, you also notice there is some writing or some sort of scripture that is carved towards the base, that is partially buried by the snow that has gathered at its base. You find more pieces of statues. Arms, part of a torso, like somebody had knocked over a series of statues. A lot of them have deep grooves in them, like these statues were either carved to pieces, like they were physically torn down–

TALIESIN: Are you describing what you're seeing at all?

SAM: Sure.

TALIESIN: I can't have a reaction to this unless I'm actually hearing anything.

MARISHA: I do Control Water. Can I do Control Water and clear away all the snow from around it?

MATT: It takes you a little bit of concentration because it's in a different state than liquid, but you begin to focus, and as you guys are watching, Keyleth focusing, a lot of the ice begins to rapidly melt into a water form and it begins to melt away, leaving the wet, muddy ground around it.

SAM: These statues that have been broken. They have gashes and slashes in them?

MATT: Yes, around the areas where they're broken.

SAM: Okay.

TALIESIN: Can I see the statues at this point?

MATT: From this distance? You can't, unfortunately.

TALIESIN: I want to get a little closer, just so I can make out the statues.

MATT: Okay. As the snowfall begins to melt away, you guys see around the base of this obelisk it is a garden of statue-pieces.

SAM: Hey, hey guys!

TALIESIN: Are they classical statues or are they people in weird poses? Are the poses weird?

MATT: Some poses look aggressive, some poses look surprised–

SAM: Okay, everybody hey hey hey.

TALIESIN: Back up, everybody. Back up now.

MATT: And we're going to go ahead and take a break on that note.

LAURA: We fought basilisks in the Frostweald before.

LIAM: Basilisks here, yes.

MATT: So. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break here for the restroom and–

MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

ASHLEY: Son of a bitch.

MATT: See you guys here in a few minutes.

TRAVIS: I don't see what the problem is.
Break

[break]
Part II

MATT: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. So. As the snow is melted away, revealing this garden of statues in various states of– some of them are still solid, some of them are just missing pieces, some of them are entirely shattered, many of them crushed or torn, thick, heavy grooves visible on the pieces of them that have been torn asunder– the party begins to gather their thoughts and figure out what this might be. You did notice as well that there was writing or script among the bottom of the obelisk, and as the snow melts away, there is another large shape that is carved into it.

TRAVIS: Can I hold my hand up to the obelisk and just feel if there's any, like, heat radiating off of it?

MATT: Sure. As you walk up to the edge of the obelisk and put your hand to it, no heat being radiated.

MARISHA: I pull out the hunk of Quall again. Anything? Hold it closer to the symbol.

MATT: It does not seem to be reacting to anything in the immediate vicinity.

TRAVIS: Man, somebody does not like sculptures.

SAM: That–

TALIESIN: Those aren't sculptures.

MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

TRAVIS: No, it's art, I get it.

MATT: What languages do you know?

TRAVIS: It's like, interpretations and it seems whimsical–

LAURA: Can I hop on the broom and fly up and see if I could spot some basilisks around?

MATT: Sure.

ASHLEY: Well, Percy, what do you think they are?

TRAVIS: Where is she going?

MARISHA: Sorry. Elven, Sylvan, Druidic, Primordial.

MATT: As you walk up and begin to hold the Hunk of Quall towards it, you see that the language– the script that is beneath the initial symbol of Ioun that Scanlan had seen is Elvish.

MARISHA: Oh, okay.

MATT: The rough translation is of old, old, old text, it reads, “A name is earned.”

MARISHA: A name is earned?

MATT: A name is earned.

TALIESIN: Oh, no.

MATT: And beneath it, there is what appears to be– the other large carving you saw on it– it looks like a triangle. A dark, recessed triangle that is just built beneath the text that tapers internally into a point. It is almost like a reverse pyramid on the inside. It is just an empty space that comes to a point.

TALIESIN: Oh, no. I think that there are basilisks nearby.

LAURA: Do I see any?

TALIESIN: I think these statues are victims.

MARISHA: Can I do a nature check? To see if I can see any signs of basilisks?

MATT: Sure. Make a nature check and you make perception check.

SAM: Are we having a short– is this a short rest?

MATT: No.

MARISHA: 21.

MATT: 21.

LAURA: 26.

MATT: 26. You glance up above, and you do not see any basilisks. What you can see, this clearing itself is visible from your height, but once you get above the tree-line, you can see the trees are pretty thick. You don't see any signs of basilisks in the vicinity. You, upon looking around the ground, you can see– it's very muddy now from all the snow that had melted down, and you see that some of the mud is slicking into holes in the ground. Like four-foot-wide cavernous holes that were dug, like little burrows that now have all this water and mud seeping into them.

MARISHA: Oh, it was made by a creature, it looks like?

MATT: It looks like. Which one of them (bubbling), expels a bunch of the mud and water, it just comes bubbling outward. At which point, you see something burst out and emerge onto the ground nearby. More of these holes start bursting forth, all the mud and liquid that has seeped into it is now being forced outward, and these creatures, now covered in mud, you can see long, lizard-like bodies with a toothy snout, multiple legs, rows of them down the spine, and its tail flickering about.

LIAM: I'm closing my eyes.

LAURA: Don't look at them!

MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

MARISHA: Fuck. Shit. I'm standing right in the middle of them.

TRAVIS: Fuck you.

MARISHA: Got the fucking shittiest initiative rolls.

ASHLEY: Yikes.

TALIESIN: I have a terrible initiative roll.

SAM: Okay, this is it.

TRAVIS: Feral Instinct's screwing me up.

SAM: Battle in the snow. But we've got Ashley.

MATT: It's hard to see with the mud across their surface, but you do see hints of blue coming through. You have encountered these previously– these are referred to as the ice-scaled basilisks, the ones that are more specific to this indigenous region. All righty. So, going by initiative order here, folks, 25 to 20?

LAURA: 22.

MATT: 22.

TRAVIS: Percy?

MATT: 20 to 15?

LIAM: 18.

SAM: 19.

MATT: 15 to ten?

TALIESIN: 13.

TRAVIS: 11.

MATT: All right.

TALIESIN: I rolled really badly.

TRAVIS: Yeah.

LAURA: Pike?

ASHLEY: I know, I know, my initiative is always shit.

TRAVIS: Welcome back, Pike!

LAURA: She likes to get the lay of the land before she attacks.

ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, you know, I do the clean-up.

MATT: Is that everybody?

MARISHA: Pike.

ASHLEY: I'm eight.

MATT: Pike? Oh. All right. Due to the series of rolls here, they're going last.

SAM: Oh!

MATT: They rolled a five, minus one penalty to dex. So, as these– which more of them burst up right next to Scanlan right there.

SAM: Oh, great.

MATT: As they all burst out of the ground, shaking their heads off of the mud, swinging off, slapping into the stone, splattering across the white snow around them, across some of you, they snarl and hiss. As you see their eyes now (click).

LIAM: Merry Christmas.

MATT: So, top of this would be you, Vex. You actually would be on top here, on the broom, looking from above.

LAURA: We can't look at them, right? We remember that from before?

MATT: You remember, you'll want to try not to.

LAURA: Can we– we can look at them to shoot at them and look away? Just don't look at them at all?

MATT: You can choose at the start of your turn whether to avert your gaze or not. You'll have disadvantage on pretty much everything as long as you're doing that.

LAURA: Ah, that's so annoying! I can't tell how everybody's clumped. They're– just basically they're all amongst all of our friends.

MATT: There's three right here, and one right there behind. It's one, two, three, four.

LAURA: Okay. Can I fly down and land on a tall tree?

MATT: You can try to.

LAURA: Try to brace myself?

MATT: If you would like to try to.

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: Let's say for the purposes of this, that you coast down to the height. Stupid broom. Let's say you land down somewhere over here.

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: All righty? There you are.

LAURA: Okay. I avert my gaze-ish, I look off to the side of one, but I can see it in my peripheral, is that how it goes, or it's like–?

MATT: You kind of guess where it is real fast, in the peripheral and kind of–

LAURA: I Hunter's Mark one.

MATT: Which one?

TRAVIS: Laser pointer.

LAURA: Is that Scanlan? That it's next to?

LIAM: Yeah, it's Scanlan next to one of them.

LAURA: I do the one next to Scanlan– That was my eye. That's just a flashlight. Oh, that's how I do it, okay.

MATT: And what are you doing?

LAURA: I'm going to–

LIAM: Professional D&D player.

LAURA: That's right. And I'm going to shoot it!

MATT: Go for it.

LAURA: Through the Blazing Bowstring.

MATT: Okay. So go ahead and roll with disadvantage for the first strike.

LAURA: Oh, I don't get regular because it's my favored terrain, so I cancel it all out?

MATT: It's disadvantage for averting your gaze, advantage for being your favored terrain– I don't think you get advantage on attacks for being in favored terrain, do you? I think it's just on ability checks.

LAURA: Okay.

MATT: Yeah. So you're at disadvantage.

LAURA: I'm at disadvantage.

MATT: I'll double-check this so the internet doesn't scream at me.

LAURA: 18.

MATT: 18 with disadvantage?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: That still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

LAURA: Plus the Blazing Bowstring, plus an additional d10.

MATT: First attack on the basilisk near Scanlan.

LAURA: 17.

MATT: 17 damage? All right, go ahead and roll for the second attack, with disadvantage as well.

LAURA: 17.

MATT: 17 does hit as well. So roll for that one. You included the Blazing Bowstring for the first one, right?

LAURA: Yes. 15 on the second.

MATT: 15 points of damage. Holding on the top of the tree, which is starting to bow a little bit with your weight, and you're clutching the broom under one arm, and you pull back and release two arrows in succession, both finding their mark. You did Hunter's Mark damage on top of those?

LAURA: Yes I did.

MATT: All right, good. You see, Scanlan, as you try and avert your gaze momentarily as you see the giant creature there, and you recall, two arrows streak past, which gives you a little PTSD, based on your morning. So that'll complete your turn?

LAURA: Yeah.

MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

SAM: It's right next to me?

MATT: Yes. Are you averting your gaze or not?

SAM: I'm averting my gaze.

MATT: All righty.

SAM: Well jeez, I mean, do I know where they are?

MATT: You saw them all burst out, once they shook off the mud, you heard her shouting and you were like, oh, hmm.

SAM: So I kind of know where they are. All right. I'm going to hop away five feet from the guy who's– I'm going to get an attack– yeah, that's a fine direction, sure.

MATT: It lunges out at you with a strike.

SAM: Yeah.

MATT: That is a 22 to hit?

SAM: Yeah.

MATT: All righty. As you pull away, pain strikes your body as the sharp, stone-crumbling teeth of the basilisk reach out and pierce your body for 12 points of piercing damage. You wrestle your elbow out of the way, you can feel the wound beneath your leather armor.

TALIESIN: That's barely an arrow and a chicken in the neck.

SAM: (laughs) Okay. And I'm going to aim to the one in the middle there– does anyone have a pointer? Yeah, that one. The other two are within 20 feet of him, yes?

MATT: Yes.

SAM: So I will cast a Wand of Fireballs right there on him.

LAURA: Yeah!

MATT: On him or behind him, or where–?

SAM: Just behind him so it hits all three?

MATT: Right, and not yourself.

SAM: Yes?

MATT: I figured that's probably what you want to do, okay. As you back up, release it in that direction, the beam of light streaks out from the wand, hitting the snowbank right behind it and exploding. Already the slushy atmosphere is– snow and fire scatter around it as they both screech out in pain. DC of what?

SAM: Oh! DC 15! I wrote it down.

MATT: 15. That's… first one fails. Second one rolled a 15, with its minus one dex, that's a 14, that's a fail. And a natural one. So full damage for all three of them. Go ahead and roll that 8d6. Vax, you're on deck, so be ready.

LIAM: All right, okay.

SAM: 25!

MATT: 25 points of damage total. The flames subside after the force of the explosion. The obelisk itself shakes from the impact. The three basilisks look notably charred, whatever mud was on them is immediately dried and is now cracking on the outside of their scales. You hear the hissing at their presence. You want to keep moving or stay where you are?

SAM: I'll tuck around the obelisk a little bit.

MATT: Okay.

SAM: And I'll turn to Pike, my love, and inspire her with a song. I will sing, (singing) I used to scry you on the shit phone…

(laughter)

SAM: (singing) Late-night when I need your love! I know when that poop phone glows, it can only be one gnome! Ever since you left the party, you, you–

(laughter)

TRAVIS: Yes!

MATT: Take your d10 inspiration die, Pike. All right, so d10 inspiration die for you. Vax, you're up.

LIAM: Yes. I'm going to click my heels together, set the boots going. I'm going to go very far away towards you, your end of the map. I want to be about a little away from the tree, though, so I've got a clear sight on that one– further back, though. I know. I want to be 50 feet away. Yeah.

MATT: Okay. You're far away, you're off-map.

LIAM: And I'm going to dagger-dagger-dagger him from very far away.

MATT: Okay.

ASHLEY: Dagger-dagger-dagger!

LIAM: And I'm going to use that sharpshooter trick where I take a negative five to attack, but add ten to damage?

MATT: Okay. Go for it.

LAURA: On all of them?

MATT: Are you averting your gaze?

LIAM: No.

SAM: Whoa!

MATT: All right, so at the start of your turn, on your first part of the round, I want you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

LIAM: From this far away?

MATT: When you started your turn, you were in melee.

LIAM: Okay. So constitution?

MATT: Constitution saving throw.

LIAM: 16.

MATT: 16 total?

LIAM: Yes.

MATT: Okay. The gaze is upon you as you glance over and see the basilisk turn its head over its shoulder at you and hisses, and the eyes catch you. You can feel the magical effects take hold of your body for a moment. You back away and quickly close your eyes, and you can feel that it begin to reach over but you shake it off.

LIAM: Oh yeah! Gamble worked out, man!

MATT: So you do not have disadvantage in these attacks.

LIAM: Yeah, I know.

MATT: Minus five for each attack.

LIAM: First one, and advantage because I'm going before it, so the first one is 18.

MATT: 18 hits.

LIAM: Second is 14. And the third is 27.

MATT: First hits, last hits.

LIAM: Last hits?

MATT: Yes.

LIAM: Okay. First one gets sneak attack damage, and plus ten to both hits because of the sharpshooter.

MATT: Correct.

LIAM: Right. So, here we go.

LAURA: (singing) There can only be one gnome.

LIAM: I can't think! 33…. 43 for the first one.

SAM: 43?!

LIAM: No-no-no… 43 plus… 49 for the first one.

MATT: 49 points of damage.

LIAM: And the last one that hits is 19. Sharpshooter.

MATT: As you run backwards, at the basilisk glaring back at you, its toothy mouth opening and the breath out, you shake it off. Throw the daggers. One (impact) sticks into one eye, and the other just (impact) into the other, and it–

(cheering)

MARISHA: Damn!

LAURA: That was fast.

MATT: The snow nearby is spattered with this kind of dark-purple basilisk blood.

SAM: Ugh! My eyes…

LAURA: (gasp) Basilisk blood! We need to take the basilisk blood! Remember, that's super good…

MARISHA: Yes! Yup. Uh-huh.

MATT: You want to stay where you are?

LIAM: I will take another ten feet back away from it all. Bye, guys!

MATT: All right. Percy, you're up.

TALIESIN: Okay!

MATT: Avert your gaze or… ?

TALIESIN: No.

MATT: Roll a constitution save.

MARISHA: Gamblers!

LIAM: (singing) You got to know when to hold 'em!

TALIESIN: That's a… (counts) 21 points.

MATT: 21?

TALIESIN: Constitution save.

SAM: Oh, it's a save! That's right!

MATT: What did you roll?

TALIESIN: I rolled a 14 plus seven.

MATT: That's great!

TALIESIN: I look at it in the eye.

MATT: You stare it down and it kind of (snarls).

TALIESIN: (barks) Bark it down.

MATT: Orthax has left his mark on you.

TALIESIN: I know. I cast Hex on it. I'm looking at the one she's Hunter's Marked, I cast Hex.

LAURA: Ooh, nice!

LIAM: Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?

MATT: Same one that she's Hunter's Marked?

TALIESIN: Yeah. And I'm taking… I'm giving it a disadvantage on willpower ability checks.

MATT: Okay.

TALIESIN: And I'm going to take three shots with Sharpshooter.

MATT: Go for it.

TALIESIN: 12. Misses.

MATT: Misses, unfortunately.

TALIESIN: Oh my god, goodbye! Going to the good die, 12…. Better! 24.

MATT: Yeah, third shot hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With the Hex damage as well.

TALIESIN: Oh my god! I'm sucking. 22 points of damage.

MATT: 22 points of damage. So the first shot goes wide. Second shot goes wide again. For some reason, it's moving faster than you expected at this moment, missing your sights. The third shot manages to find the front of its nose and (shattering) the front of its skull shatters and it kind of crumbles to the ground.

TALIESIN: So, while shooting, I ran from that one tree all the way to the other one. That was a running shot, so…

MATT: Okay, so you run this way?

TALIESIN: Yeah.

LIAM: It was a lot harder the last time.

TALIESIN: Behind the tree over there.

MATT: Over here? Because you can only get about that far with your running.

TALIESIN: About there.

MATT: Right there? Okay. Then you got behind there. That's fine. All right, that ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.

TRAVIS: I would like to avert my gaze, and go into an averted-gaze rage! (growls)

(laughter)

TRAVIS: And I would like to run at that little bastard right there.

MATT: All right.

LIAM: (Grog voice) I can't see you but I'm so angry!

TRAVIS: I'm using my Feral– no, that's wrong. I'm using my… what the fuck is it called?

TALIESIN: Slap Fight. Hair Pull.

TRAVIS: I've totally forgotten what's it called. What the fuck is it? Reckless Attack!

MATT: All right, there you go.

TRAVIS: Yes. So can I cancel out the disadvantage and get just a normal roll?

MATT: Yes, you would have a normal roll on this.

TRAVIS: Yes! And Great Weapon Master on these two strikes.

MATT: All right.

TRAVIS: Shit! Nine.

MATT: (whoosh)

TRAVIS: (yells) (laughs) Shit! Nope.

LAURA: It's a bad luck night for Grog rolling!

MATT: You rush forward (sword swinging). You thought it was there, you're sure it was there, you heard it hiss. It's about two inches below where you swung.

TRAVIS: I'm so mad that I come out of my rage because I don't hit anything, right?

MATT: You don't have to hit it. You have to attack. There's a difference.

TRAVIS: Well, I've been swinging.

MATT: Yeah. (laughs) Ending Grog's turn, Keyleth, you're up.

MARISHA: How many are left? Two?

MATT: There are two left.

MARISHA: I am remembering what the basilisks did last time, and I've only done this once before, and am going to go…

MATT: Avert your gaze or not?

MARISHA: I'm looking down and transforming into a giant scorpion.

TALIESIN: Scorpions are fascinating.

SAM: How so? They don't have eyes, or something?

MARISHA: Yeah, they have blindsight.

SAM: Wait, what does that mean?

MARISHA: It means they don't use their eyes to see things. They have blindsight.

MATT: So Scanlan, as you're averting your gaze, you glance over as Keyleth goes (poof) into this giant scorpion, big tail, big pincers, black and red carapace. It's upsetting.

SAM: I'm scared.

MARISHA: (clicking pincers)

TALIESIN: That's really upsetting.

MARISHA: Where are they? The two are kind of in the middle there?

SAM: One's next to Grog.

MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to move in between them and I'm going to do a multiattack on both of those. I'll start on the one that Grog's not focusing on.

MATT: Okay, go for it.

MARISHA: So I have three attacks, two with my claws and one with my stinger.

MATT: Do it. Disadvantage on all attacks.

MARISHA: No, why?

MATT: Because you averted your gaze.

MARISHA: No, I didn't. I have blindsight as a scorpion.

MATT: Right, but at the start of your turn, before anything happens, is when it happens. Did you avert your gaze or not?

MARISHA: No, I turned into a scorpion.

MATT: Before that happened, at the start of your turn, did you avert your gaze or not?

LIAM: You said you averted your gaze.

MARISHA: I said I looked down, but once I'm a scorpion, I have blindsight.

MATT: Right, but the effect takes place before your transformation happens. So, yes or no, do you want to take the advantage or not?

MARISHA: Well, I said I looked down and turned into a scorpion to try and avoid it, so… I mean, I did, yeah.

MATT: All right, so disadvantage on the attacks.

MARISHA: That's the whole reason I did the scorpion.

SAM: But it's also looking cool.

LAURA: It's okay, from here on out, you're fine.

MARISHA: Miss. Six misses, for the first one. That's a three, it misses again. Nope, that's a two. Last one is an eight, plus a four… So that's 12. Probably still nothing.

MATT: Let me think here for a second. The scorpion has blindsight?

SAM: Starring Ashley Johnson! Blindsight!

TALIESIN: How did we not walk into that? How have we been sitting here and that didn't happen?

MARISHA: That legitimately made me spit my fucking coffee in my face.

MATT: No, you're right. I was thinking more in terms of it averting the magical power of the basilisk, but you could still avert and blindsight would allow you to still know where it is without having the disadvantage, so yes.

LIAM: Although with coffee in the eye, disadvantage is back.

MATT: This is true. I'll let you reroll those attacks.

MARISHA: All three? Okay, I wish I remembered them. Do you want me to reroll all three?

MATT: Just reroll all three. That's on me. I was thinking in wrong terms.

SAM: Matt, you're the worst.

MATT: I know. I know, I am the worst.

MARISHA: Jeez, I'm going to tweet at you later about this.

TALIESIN: Actually Matt, how blindsight works…

MATT: They've already been sent, I'm sure.

TALIESIN: I'm shutting the fuck up now.

MARISHA: These are just straight, they don't have disadvantage? First attack, 14.

MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately.

MARISHA: Second attack was a natural 18, so 22.

MATT: That does hit. And for the tail?

MARISHA: For the tail, 16.

MATT: 16 hits. That was my bad.

LIAM: Just a bunch of idiots dorking around, guys.

TALIESIN: There is coffee everywhere.

MARISHA: That's not very much. Four damage for the claw attack, and then for the sting, oh my god. Three damage, and they have to take a constitution saving throw.

MATT: 15, what's the DC?

MARISHA: 12.

MATT: Yeah, so it makes the save.

MARISHA: Fuck.

SAM: Yeah, Keyleth, good one!

MARISHA: Okay, they take 4d10 poison, and on a failed save, they take half as much.

MATT: Okay, so roll 4d10.

SAM: 4d10 is a lot!

LAURA: You should be a scorpion all the time!

MARISHA: Thanks guys! Wow, these are fucking horrifying rolls. Six, seven, eight, nine, plus seven is 16 points of poison damage.

MATT: Total, so that would be eight for half of it.

MARISHA: No, that is halved.

MATT: Nice, that's not bad at all. All right, so as your first claw streaks off its armor, the second one grabs hold and– hold on a second.

LIAM: I'm listening!

MATT: Thank you.

MARISHA: Sorry, it was eight damage.

TALIESIN: No, you did, because you did half the dice.

SAM: No, she did 4d10.

TALIESIN: She did 4d10?

MARISHA: Eight damage.

MATT: Eight damage, all right. All right, so as the first claw streaks across its armor, second one manages to grab and actually pince onto it, dealing some damage. As you're holding it there, the tail strikes inward, manages to pierce the outside of the scaly basilisk hide. Not as effective as it could've been, but still you see its body tense with the sudden pulse of poison in its system. That brings us to Pike! What's up?

ASHLEY: Okay. Since I can't see it, is there any way that I can Guiding Bolt one of the basilisks without hurting anybody?

MATT: Yeah, but for Guiding Bolt I believe it's a spell attack roll. Am I correct on that? Or does it automatically hit? I'm trying to remember which one it is. You guys have so many spells. Guiding Bolt, yeah. You can totally Guiding Bolt. You'll have disadvantage on the attack roll, but you can do it still.

LAURA: Do it, Pike!

ASHLEY: All right, let's do it!

MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage on the attack.

SAM: Which one, the one near Grog or the one near scorpion-face?

ASHLEY: Which one would I not hurt anybody?

MATT: It's not so much you hurting anybody, you wouldn't hit anybody. It's about if you miss or not.

MARISHA: Grog and I can take it anyway.

ASHLEY: Okay.

LIAM: The one by Grog.

ASHLEY: Yeah, we'll do the one by Grog.

MATT: Okay.

ASHLEY: Oh, natural 20!

MATT: But it's with disadvantage, so you have to roll it again.

LIAM: Say it again.

TALIESIN: One in 20 chance.

ASHLEY: 13.

MATT: With that, unfortunately, as you're holding your eyes at bay–

SAM: Wait! You're inspired!

MATT: You can add the inspiration dice if you want to.

ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll add inspiration!

MATT: Okay, so roll a d10 and add that to the attack. 13 plus…

ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. All right, seven. So 20.

MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on Guiding Bolt. So 4d6 radiant damage.

ASHLEY: Okay… 17!

MATT: Nice, all right! 17 points of radiant damage, and now there is a glowing hue of radiant light around it, so even though you're not looking at it, it's a pretty decent beacon, so it gives advantage on the next attack roll against it. Keep that in mind. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are, Pike?

ASHLEY: I'll stay, yeah, I'll stay.

MATT: All right. Now it is their turn. This one turns around and it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you, Keyleth, in scorpion form. That's a 17, plus six?

MARISHA: That hits.

MATT: All right. You take 11, plus three. 14 points of piercing damage, plus seven points of poison damage.

MARISHA: So that was 21?

TALIESIN: My brain is not doing numbers for some reason.

MARISHA: I know, and I keep looking at you.

MATT: Against you, Grog… It hits you regardless. It has advantage on you because you're averting your gaze, plus you had your reckless attack last round. It still only rolls a nine, plus six, so that's 14? 15 to hit.

TRAVIS: Misses.

MATT: This one bites out towards you, and even though it's not there, because it's so bright, you see it shift, and you (boom) hit it in the front of its snout with the base of your sword. That brings us to the top of the initiative order. Vex, you're up.

LAURA: Awesome. So it's the glowing one, I get advantage on the attack, because it's glowing?

MATT: You do, yes.

LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark it.

MATT: Okay, so Hunter's Mark moves over.

LAURA: I'm going to avert my gaze, and roll a regular attack then? Since it's advantage?

MATT: Yes. It cancels out the disadvantage. So roll your first attack against it.

LAURA: That's 31.

MATT: 31 hits, yeah.

LAURA: 15 plus Hunter's Mark– Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark it.

MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah, you did.

LAURA: Okay! What did I say, 15? 18.

MATT: 18, all right. So the first arrow strikes into it. It's still standing. It's looking a little hurt, but it's still standing.

LAURA: And then do I still get regular attacks? This is at disadvantage.

MATT: Disadvantage on the next one, yeah.

LAURA: 19?

MATT: Yeah. What's your total? 19 with disadvantage? That does hit, yep.

LAURA: 18.

MATT: 18, all right. This arrow, however, manages to strike through the top of the head, stapling the mouth shut, and it falls to the ground as its eyes slowly glaze over.

LAURA: I roar from up in the tree!

TALIESIN: Wait, do you let go of the broom to roar?

LAURA: No, I hold the broom in my hand!

MARISHA: Katy Perry style.

LAURA: Defying Gravity style.

LIAM: Holding it in your hand while you're flying on it?

LAURA: I'm not flying, I'm in a tree, dude.

MATT: Yeah, she's clutched up on top of a tree.

LIAM: I'm not looking at you.

MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. Are you averting your gaze or not?

SAM: I'm not only averting my gaze, I'm looking towards the holes that it came out of, any of the holes that are near me.

MATT: There's two that are near you.

SAM: Okay, I'm going to go over to one and throw a Fireball down into it.

MATT: Okay! So, Scanlan, you walk over to the nearby holes behind you, where the one that snuck up behind you essentially came out of, aim down, and make sure you mark off these charges for each use of the wand.

SAM: Yes.

MATT: You (whoosh) release the beam, which gets about 15, 20 feet down before it blasts. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

TRAVIS: Like putting yourself at the mouth of a cannon.

SAM: Seven.

LAURA: Oh no!

MATT: Roll 8d6. But take half damage, because it's mostly guarded and this is a circumstantial, at the outskirts of it, you're not taking the full brunt of the Fireball. However, you do get caught in the very edge of the backblast.

SAM: 29.

MATT: So you take half that. So you take 15 points of fire damage and are blown about five feet backward onto the ground. However, the ground shudders beneath all your feet, and the earth, the wet damp earth (squelch) sinks inward and the tunnel collapses. A few of the others (squelch) into it. There's still a couple more on the opposite side that are open. There's two more on this side that are open.

SAM: So the tunnels nearest me are not accessible anymore.

MATT: The two that were there and there both, the ground from it shuddering, collapsed inward, and now the mud has filled the space. There's these small sinkholes where they were.

SAM: All right. I'll spend the rest of my time in this round licking my wounds and studying the obelisk to see if I can see any other clues or anything on it.

MATT: Okay. You can see the text that she saw upon there, the Elvish script.

SAM: I can't read it, though.

MATT: But you see it there, and you see the triangle, a dark recessed triangle about that big that is in the base of it.

SAM: Is it a hole, or is it…?

MATT: It's a hole, but it's carved. It's not a perfect triangle, it starts as a triangle and slowly, as it recesses inward, comes to a point towards the back.

TALIESIN: Like a reverse pyramid.

SAM: I throw a snowball in it.

MATT: (impact)

SAM: It's safe, guys.

MATT: Vax, you're up.

LIAM: All right, I'm off the map, but I want to try to come down towards the tree that I think Percy's at. He's between two trees. I'm going to avert my gaze, I'm going to look at the ground, come up around the side of that tree, and I'm listening for scorpion clacking and basilisk hissing, and I'm going to throw, dagger dagger dagger, in the direction of the basilisk I hear near scorpion claws clutching. Does that make sense?

MATT: Mm-hmm.

LIAM: All right. So this is at disadvantage because I'm looking at the ground. So first one is… first one is a 21.

MATT: 21 hits.

LIAM: And second one is… 19?

MATT: Hits.

LIAM: Third one is 16.

MATT: Hits. These are not with Sharpshooter?

LIAM: No, not at all. So we've got ten, plus nine, plus ten.

MATT: With that, your final dagger hits in the side of its rib cage, and the creature slumps over on the ground, letting out a horrible, gurgling hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud.

LIAM: Daredevil.

LAURA: Was that all of them?

MATT: Currently, yes. Make a perception check.

LAURA: Okay. Oh, I roll with advantage, because I'm in the forest! Oh my god, I rolled a one twice in a fucking row. I see nothing.

SAM: Two natural ones?

MARISHA: We are fucking eating it on rolls tonight.

MATT: You're about to look down to inspect the vicinity. However, the tree is starting to bow forward and you (grunt) have to catch yourself, and you have no chance to even survey the territory.

TALIESIN: Pine sap gets in your eye.

LIAM: Laura Bailey dies on stream.

TRAVIS: I rolled a 16.

MATT: As you take a moment, the rage still in, you can hear the blood pumping in your ears, but you also hear the (hiss) rising hissing, what sounds like a distant echo coming up from a subterranean tunnel.

LAURA: Oh no.

MARISHA: Subterranean tunnel?

TRAVIS: Yeah. That Fireball, I think it might have pissed them off.

SAM: Good.

MARISHA: Can I use my blindsight tremor-sense to see if I can feel how far away they are?

MATT: You do. You feel beneath the ground. It's less of a tremor-sense, more being able to sense the vibrations in the air around you. You can tell that there is motion coming from underneath.

MARISHA: Sounds like a lot of them?

MATT: A few more.

ASHLEY: Fireball the other holes?

MARISHA: I'm going to drop my scorpion form.

SAM: Oh, god, Keyleth, you're horrible! Oh, wait, no, you've turned back to normal.

MARISHA: The things you say, Scanlan. I'm just going to do a Wall of Stone, flat over the area with the holes.

MATT: So from the stone chunks and portions of the shattered bodies that litter part of this garden, a giant stone wall forms around them and builds over it, sealing these holes. Eventually you hear a (knocking) (reptilian snarl) scraping sounds.

SAM: They're friendly!

LIAM: “I can't breathe down here!”

MATT: They're not budging it, they're just hitting it from underneath, and it's getting more frantic as time goes on.

SAM: How long can you hold that?

MARISHA: It'll last until they bust out of it, so we either keep moving or figure out where we're going from here.

SAM: What is this obelisk? It seems important if these things are protecting it.

LAURA: What does it say?

MARISHA: It has writing in Elvish in it.

SAM: What does it say?

MARISHA: It says, a name is earned, in Elvish.

SAM: Should we say a name to it and see what happens?

MATT: One of the stone parts of the wall begins to crack from underneath.

LAURA: Didn't Osysa say something about, her mate wouldn't say its name?

SAM: That's right, that's right.

LAURA: And this is a symbol of Ioun.

TRAVIS: Should we say Ioun in Elvish?

MARISHA: I say Ioun in Elvish.

MATT: You say it out into the air.

SAM: Why don't you say it into this triangle hole over here?

MARISHA: Ioun!

LAURA: Say knowledge in Elvish.

MARISHA: Knowledge!

SAM: Elvish is just English except muffled.

MARISHA: I'm going in the triangle hole!

MATT: A moment passes.

MARISHA: Osysa! Sphinx!

LAURA: A name is earned.

TRAVIS: What's in the hole?

MARISHA: What's in the hole?

SAM: I don't know what's in the hole. Nothing.

MATT: A basilisk face bursts through the stone wall.

SAM: Whack-a-Mole! Grog! Whack-a-Mole!

TRAVIS: Can I run over and play golf?

MATT: Yeah. Do you want to avert your gaze or not?

TRAVIS: Nah.

MATT: All right, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

LIAM: Shite.

TRAVIS: 22.

MATT: Without an issue, the eyes find yours and you just grin as you bring… what kind of attacks do you want to do?

TRAVIS: Reckless and Great Weapon Master.

MATT: All right, go for it.

TRAVIS: That's a natural 20. I'll take that one on the first one.

MATT: Okay, and the other one?

TRAVIS: 19. 20.

MATT: Both hit. The first is a critical. This would be over here.

TRAVIS: 31?

MATT: Did you roll the… Is that times two?

TRAVIS: No, that's just the attack.

LIAM: It's critical.

MATT: Before you add your modifier.

TRAVIS: Before the modifier? It was 12 before the modifier.

MATT: So 24 plus the modifier.

TRAVIS: Which is 32, plus ten is 42.

MATT: 42. Did you roll the additional brutal critical rolls?

TRAVIS: Nope.

MATT: So roll 4d6 on top of that, because of your brutal critical. I think it is.

LIAM: I think we can all agree it's the jelly of the month club at this point.

TRAVIS: 17.

MATT: For a grand total of…

SAM: 59?

LAURA: Do you double those ones though, because it's the dice?

TRAVIS: That's just the first hit.

MATT: Yeah, all right. 59 points of damage. You square up.

TRAVIS: Happy Gilmore-style.

MATT: You strike down with the blade at an angle, using the stone holding it in place like an executioner's block, and the blade scrapes against the stone as you strike, finding itself embedding about seven to eight inches into the throat of the basilisk as its head's protruding out. Immediately, blood begins to pour out of its side, and it's gurgling at its attempt to try and push through. You wedge the blade out. Go for your next strike. You already rolled your attack, which was a 19, so roll damage on that one.

TRAVIS: Seven, 12, 20, 30, on the second one.

LIAM: Oh, that's all?

MATT: With the second strike, you (whoosh) clean slice. The head (splat) onto the stonework there, the body still wedging the hole shut. The neck is a clean cut, and starts gouting blood out.

TRAVIS: I dip the tip of the sword into the little well and I pick up the head.

MATT: Which, by the way, both saving throws were failed, so you gain another plus two to strength.

SAM: Wow, you're catching up to Pike!

LAURA: Ow! Nothing.

TALIESIN: Did you cut yourself on your cup?

LAURA: No, I just hit my tooth.

MARISHA and TALIESIN: Oh, I hate that.

MATT: All right, so you can feel the impact still attempting from beneath growing more and more frantic.

MARISHA: I say, earned!

ASHLEY: Can I go collect some of the (stuttering) basilisk– I can't say that. Can I get some of the blood and collect it?

MATT: Sure. And you notice that the longer it stays out there, the blood itself is beginning to freeze in the general atmosphere and get slushy.

LAURA: We can get some and put it in my bag. It keeps things good.

ASHLEY: Can I stab the carcass then in another area and get some fresh in the body?

MATT: Yeah, there's plenty of carcasses of basilisks around. As they're inspecting, and you still feel the impacts from underneath the stone wall from the other tunnel, you manage to gather, we'll say two small vials of basilisk blood.

ASHLEY: Vex!

TRAVIS: Yeah, put it in Vex's little refrigerator Bag of Holding.

MATT: Okay. The slamming on the other side of the stone wall slowly subsides until silence comes.

MARISHA: Did they give up?

TRAVIS: Has anybody put their hand in the hole yet?

LAURA: It's all you, Grog.

TRAVIS: All right, I put my hand in the hole.

MATT: Where the one you killed is?

TRAVIS: No, the triangle.

MATT: Okay. So you take your hand and you place it inside this empty recess in the obelisk. It reaches in, and the shadow of the obelisk completely takes it to the wrist. Nothing happens.

SAM: I'm going to take my Ioun Stone and shove it in the hole.

MATT: Okay. You take the Ioun Stone and place it in the hole, and it has a soft light that it gives off naturally from the magical enchantment, and it lights the inside of the dark recess, and as you place it inside, the top of the obelisk begins to glow ever-so-faintly, like a little beacon. The very top of the stone glows a matching color to your stone.

MARISHA: A matching color?

MATT: Yeah. I need you all to make a perception check.

SAM: 17.

MARISHA: 14.

LIAM: 16.

TRAVIS: 19!

LAURA: 25.

TALIESIN: 11.

SAM: Ashley Blindsight?

ASHLEY: 16!

MATT: Okay. You catch a little bit of this, Grog, and you perk up as you notice, and you see immediately. There is a matching beacon, a faint glow that appears to be streaking down the mountainside in the distance. It's a little bit off-center from the direct south direction that you're facing, but there is a slight marker, very faintly visible on the mountain range, just visible over the treetops.

LAURA: I drop a pin in that, and I tell Keyleth, now you can use that thing!

MARISHA: I hold up the Hunk of Quall.

LAURA: No, I mean your spell, Keyleth. Fastest way to get to this point!

MARISHA: I didn't bring it because everyone said not to learn that spell.

SAM: That was today, wasn't it?

LAURA: I thought you already learned it.

MARISHA: He said to learn something else because it wasn't going to be useful.

LAURA: No, he said just don't use that thing!

MARISHA: No, you said to learn something, it was at the beginning of the day!

SAM: You can't unlearn things! It's all good.

LAURA: It's okay, it's okay. I can see it.

MATT: You had it already memorized when you guys got to the edge of the forest, I'm pretty sure.

MARISHA: Okay. I thought you were saying to pick something else because it wouldn't be handy. But I take it back, and I'll use it now if you want.

TALIESIN: No, we're good. We're good.

MARISHA: I'm so confused.

MATT: Up to you.

MARISHA: Is it me tonight?

TALIESIN: It is a really weird pot of coffee. It's not just you.

MARISHA: Do I need sleep? What am I missing?

MATT: It's all good.

MARISHA: I can keep it.

TRAVIS: Just lick your finger and stick it in the wind.

LAURA: Just use the spell and pretend that you never unlearned it.

MARISHA: I never unlearned it! It's been there the whole time! I didn't use it. It's not like I used a 6th-level spell. Look, guys! Find the Path! That way!

MATT: Okay. So what is it that you're focusing on for the spell?

MARISHA: That beam of light!

LAURA: That I pointed out to her.

MARISHA: That she pointed out. Am I doing this wrong?

MATT: No, you're not doing it wrong! You cast the spell and, concentrating on the source of this beacon, you feel the direction that would pull you the best way to travel towards that beacon is to travel towards that beacon.

LIAM: Look, you're just doing what the bossy half-elf told you to do. Just go with it.

MARISHA: What, that one?

LIAM: That's the only bossy half-elf here.

SAM: DM, can I experiment and take away, if I take away my Ioun Stone, does the light fade?

MATT: As you pull the Ioun Stone out of it, the beacon does fade, yes. But you have a direction.

MARISHA: I have it marked now. I have a pin in it. Right, that counts?

MATT: Right. No matter where you travel in this place, you will have a directional position towards that beacon.

LAURA: See, there we go.

MARISHA: Fucking handy, that one is.

TRAVIS: Yep, redemption.

MARISHA: Totally a great 6th-level spell I'm going to use all the time going forward.

LIAM: Oh, for fuck's sake. Here we go, people. Here we go. And we're moving.

TRAVIS: We take off at a jog now!

SAM: Wait, before we leave, is there anything else we need to do here? Do we need to go down into the tunnels? Do we need to piss on the obelisk? Do we want to do anything?

LIAM: You should piss on the obelisk just to be sure.

TALIESIN: You should lick it, too, after you piss on it.

TRAVIS: Let's not.

SAM: Let's go.

MATT: Are you guys leaving?

SAM: Wait, we need some basilisk blood and stuff!

LAURA: We got some!

MATT: You're standing amongst the obelisk, a long series of mud with a bunch of mostly together stone statues of people and pieces of people around.

TRAVIS: Do we want to check the other building ruins? We didn't check those at all. There's a whole corner of a building over there.

LAURA: Sure.

TRAVIS: Well, go check it!

LAURA: I go look at it.

LIAM: Half-elves look at the building structure.

MATT: Make an investigation check.

TRAVIS: What the hot holy fuck.

LIAM: 26.

TALIESIN: It says it was forged by dwarves, that's all I can understand.

LAURA: Investigation?

MATT: Investigation, yeah.

LAURA: 19.

MATT: 19, all right. You guys both start gathering around the sides of the ruin. Glancing about the outside, it looks like at one point it was a smaller structure, probably part of the construction, like this here was a satellite place of worship for Ioun, like a beacon as part of a journey. But nothing about it catches your eyes. As you're stepping over the remnants of the stone individuals on the ground, you catch your eye on one of the individuals you see, lying partially submerged in the snow and mud. You glance down and see two arms that are out like this, although the right arm from the elbow down is missing. It's broken off in stone. Both are reaching out. A young human male, shortish brown hair, spectacles at the end of his nose, thin body and tucked-in, nice buttoned shirt. Slacks. This is Tyriok, the mapmaker.

LIAM: The mapmaker?

TALIESIN: You're a terrible person.

LAURA: No, why would you do that, Matthew?

MATT: I didn't do this! He was traveling the world to take notes, people!

LIAM: I take… Wait! Everybody shush! I look at him for a moment and then I leave him, and I don't tell anyone else.

MARISHA: What?

SAM: We have Pike with us!

LIAM: I don't tell anyone else. Pike didn't see him. His arm is broken off! You don't fucking know he exists. He's gone.

ASHLEY: But, but!

LAURA: That's terrible!

TALIESIN: Why don't you two just write a sequel to Batman/Superman while you're at it? Just destroy everything. I don't care anymore.

LAURA: We could heal him!

MATT: You don't know. Eventually, after you guys do a perusal of the ruins, you find your way back to the party and you guys continue traveling which way, towards the beacon?

LAURA: Towards the beacon!

MARISHA: I've got it in my head now.

LIAM: Wait, wait, wait, I go to Pike. I go to Pike. Pike.

ASHLEY: Yeah? Hi, Vax!

LIAM: Do you remember that mapmaker? Were you with us? So much shit has happened. Do you remember Tyriok the mapmaker?

ASHLEY: I don't think I was with you.

LIAM: There's a man over there. His arm is gone. Can you fix stoning? Can you fix a man who's been turned to stone?

ASHLEY: I can try. Remember one time we fixed Vex, when she was turned to stone, the last time we fought the basilisks.

LIAM: Two years ago, yeah. What did we do?

ASHLEY: We covered her in basilisk blood.

LIAM: I need to take a walk. Could you do that? Could you do that?

ASHLEY: Sure. Which stone is he?

LIAM: Look over there by that tree there. Do you see him? There's two hands pointing towards the sky.

SAM: One hand.

LIAM: Two.

ASHLEY: One and a half. All right, can I head over there?

MATT: You walk over there, and you do see a number of broken body parts all turned to stone in various states of disuse and crumbling. You do see a young man who's caught with his arms out, one broken off at the elbow, staring up, glasses at the end of his nose, looking both frightened and frozen in a moment of complete unaware danger.

ASHLEY: Okay. Can I try covering him in some of the basilisk's blood?

MATT: Sure. You take one of the vials that you collected and take the basilisk blood and pour it over the statue. The blood congeals and spills over, crystallizing slowly as the ice cold gets to it. It doesn't seem to have an effect.

ASHLEY: It's been too long.

MATT: You gather, based on the last time it happened, the blood needs to be applied within a short period of time after the person turns to stone. Do you have anything else that might help?

ASHLEY: Probably Greater Restoration.

MATT: Do you have that prepared?

ASHLEY: I do.

MATT: You concentrate, grasping the symbol of Sarenrae around your neck and touch your hand out. The warm glow of Sarenrae's divine energy transferring into the stone form. The form glows with energy, and the glow subsides and fades, the stone texture of his body beginning to slowly soften, and the color returning to his skin, and for a moment the head seems to shake, and the eyes clarify, and a voice begins to peek through these previously frozen vocal cords. “I mean no–” (screams) As all of a sudden his arm begins to spray gouts of blood.

TRAVIS: I got it! I got it! I start catching it with the sword.

MATT: (stuttering) He turns to you, and sprays right across your face.

TRAVIS: Good! Splash on! Yes!

MATT: “Help! Help me!”

ASHLEY: I grab his arm and Cure Wounds! I don't know if that's a really good move.

MATT: Go ahead and heal him up a bit.

ASHLEY: Can I try to reattach his arm?

MATT: You gather that might have been something to do before you had restored him.

SAM: Oh, shit.

MATT: However, go ahead and heal for Cure Wounds. Roll a d8 plus five.

TRAVIS: That's kind of fucking hilarious.

ASHLEY: 5d8 plus five?

MATT: Depending on what level you want to use on him. A level one is 1d8 plus five.

ASHLEY: Oh, God, okay. I feel like I'm using all this, but I don't know. Okay, so let's do level five.

MATT: Level five. All right, go for it. 5d8 plus five.

TALIESIN: Not our finest hour. Pretty reasonable hour, but it's definitely not the finest. We brought most of a mapmaker back.

MATT: So how much is that?

ASHLEY: 29.

MATT: 29, okay. As you reach out and grasp the edge of his bleeding stump…

ASHLEY: Stop moving!

MATT: “I just–” (yelps) The warmth causes the pain to fade and he calms for a second. “Oh. Sorry.” He looks down as the wound has stopped bleeding, skin is scabbed over, and it looks like it's now in a place where it's no longer an open wound. It is mostly healed over, though he is now missing part of his arm.

LAURA: Can you regrow his little arm like you regrew my brother's little nubbin of a toe?

MATT: This is a bit beyond your healing capabilities.

TRAVIS: C'mon, Deadpool hand.

MATT: At which point he goes, “Thank you, small one. I–” And he goes to reach up for his glasses and… Other hand.

LAURA: Oh, we're terrible.

TALIESIN: Technically saved seven-eighths of a mapmaker.

MATT: He looks around at the rest of you. “Oh! Hello, it's been a while. We haven't… Well, I seem to have gotten myself in a bit of a predicament.”

SAM: What happened?

MATT: “Well, I was… Well, I had two escorts. And I had been making my way through most of Tal'Dorei, and had gotten as far as this region, and… That's all I remember.”

LAURA: Basilisks? Big lizard creatures?

MATT: “Yes. Very scary. I tried to run, and that's all I remember.”

LAURA: Was it just the three of you, then? Not a large group of people?

MATT: “No, just three of us.”

ASHLEY: What were you doing over here?

MATT: “I was trying to finish this portion of the map. If I… Ah!” And he goes over and reaches through some of the snow and pulls up a large stone bag that is currently still attached to his broken arm.

TALIESIN: No!

MATT: “Um. Is this…?”

TRAVIS: Nope! No, no, that's just part of a– It was a statue garden, it's not a big deal. It's just a fragment.

MATT: “All right. Well, these were my maps.”

SAM: Are they stone?

MATT: They are stone, currently.

LAURA: Can we– Oh, no.

TRAVIS: Is he on the ground still?

MATT: No, he's standing. “Oh boy.” He takes his glasses off and goes to rub them into his shirt and… does it with one hand and puts them back on.

ASHLEY: Oh, buddy.

LAURA: I feel terrible.

MATT: “Well.”

TALIESIN: It's like a one-legged duck walking around.

MATT: “What do I do?”

TRAVIS: Which hand does he have, his left?

MATT: He has his left hand.

TRAVIS: Are you right-handed?

MATT: “I'm kind of ambidextrous.”

TRAVIS: Thank gods for that.

LAURA: That's good, that's good. Well…

TALIESIN: A lot's happened.

MATT: There's shock on his face. He still hasn't quite taken in all of this stuff.

SAM: Everything is going to be okay.

MARISHA: Well, you have a great story now.

TALIESIN: And a period of adjustment.

MATT: “This is very true. This is a valid point.”

TALIESIN: We should send him back to the encampment.

LAURA: It's like a two-day walk.

SAM: These escorts you had with you who were also turned to stone, were they important to you? Were they friends of yours?

MATT: “I hired them as part of this endeavor. They were nice fellows. Hold on a second.” He starts walking off and starts rummaging through the pieces of stone and various people, picking up heads. “No. Well, that's Alex. Golly, I don't… I don't know where Gerald is, but… Can I come with you for now?”

LAURA: Well, you're more than– Actually–

TRAVIS: No.

LAURA: He's rather smart, isn't he?

SAM: He has knowledge of the area.

TALIESIN: That actually could be useful.

LAURA: Here's the thing. It's very dangerous, dear, and it's quite possible you might be turned into stone again.

MATT: “I don't want that.”

LAURA: No, we don't want that for you, either.

TRAVIS: Also eaten alive, burned, shot, stabbed–

LAURA: Straight-up killed.

TRAVIS: – pulled apart, maimed–

LAURA: Beheaded.

TRAVIS: – Lacerated.

LAURA: All options.

TRAVIS: But that's just in the mornings.

LAURA: But you're more than welcome to join us, for a short amount of time. Or you can head back to a camp that's about a day and a half away.

MATT: “All right. Whereabouts are you going?”

TRAVIS: We're heading up the mountain.

MATT: I'll head for the camp.

TRAVIS: Are you sure? We could always use you as a decoy– I mean, as an aid.

MATT: “I'm good. I'm all right. Thank you, though. I appreciate the offer. I have a lot to think about.”

MARISHA: I could…

TALIESIN: Well, we'll run into him when we get back.

TRAVIS: Do you need a hand finding your way to the encampment?

SAM: Oh, Grog.

TALIESIN: Not cool.

LIAM: Groan.

MATT: He starts walking northward, basically trailing past the path where you guys walked from.

LAURA: I feel like we should help him or something.

LIAM: Not bad enough to actually do it, though, right?

MARISHA: I have Conjure Woodland Beings in my back pocket today, so I could conjure you a little posse to escort you.

LAURA: That would be good!

LIAM: Have some squirrels, buddy.

MARISHA: Have a little posse.

MATT: What's the duration on that one?

MARISHA: I don't know. That's something else that I haven't done, ever.

SAM: Untested high-level spell? Do it!

MARISHA: That always works so well.

MATT: It's an hour of concentration.

TRAVIS: Is this as far as you got, or did you make it up the mountain previously?

MATT: “I was cresting through the base of the mountain, and made it most of the way down the Stormcrest and was heading back through the Frostweald.”

TRAVIS: Oh, you've been up there already?

LAURA: You've been to the base of the Stormcrest Mountains!

MATT: “I was kind of along the side. We were trying to make our way through the central portion of the mountain pass so we could keep track of the division of topography on both top and bottom.”

TRAVIS: Oh, man. Why you didn't say so? We could really use your help here.

LAURA: Actually, did you see something similar to this obelisk at the base of the mountain?

MATT: “Uh…” He looks back and thinks to himself. “Not quite like this, though, but there are a number of cavern entrances that litter various portions of the base of the mountain.”

TRAVIS: Did you go in any of them?

MATT: “No, see, I was afraid those would be too dangerous. So I went into the forest.”

TRAVIS: Right.

MATT: “Anyway.”

TRAVIS: Well, look, you don't really seem to have a lot on you. Why don't you join us for just a little bit, to the areas that he knows, and then we'll send you back on your way, maybe with a bit of ale, a little bit of food? Maybe a weapon?

MATT: “That would be fantastic. And… Thank you. I realize now that if you hadn't come by, I probably would have been there forever.”

LAURA: Yes, well, we're sorry about the arm, dear.

MATT: “There are worse things. And I can retrain to write with this arm. It's totally fine.”

SAM: Yes. You're lucky to be alive, and now you're going on an adventure with us. Hey, who has two thumbs and is really excited? You and me, both doing this.

MATT: You know what, make a charisma check.

TALIESIN: You worry me.

SAM: Charisma?

MATT: Yeah, add your plus five charisma bonus.

SAM: 20.

MATT: 20? As you do that, he… “Yeah. You're right! You're right. I'm thankful to be alive today, and it's because of you guys.”

LIAM: Technically true.

MATT: “Let's travel!”

TRAVIS: Well, listen, I'll walk with you. Lead the way.

MATT: “All right, so where are you going? Because this place was dangerous, and that place is dangerous, and we don't want to go that way.”

TRAVIS: Yeah, Vex'ahlia will point where we're headed.

LAURA: Why don't you want to go that way? Have you seen orcs in this wood?

MATT: He points and says, “There's a lot of them that way. We came through here to avoid them, and that's when this all happened.”

LAURA: Ooh. Actually, we should probably take care of the orcs.

TALIESIN: Get the orcs really quick, and then we can send him back with the refugees from there.

MARISHA: We did say we were going to take care of the orcs.

LAURA: Yes, we did.

MARISHA: We did promise that.

LAURA: What do you say, Grog? Would you like to kill some orc?

TRAVIS: Do you always ask questions to which you know the answer already?

LAURA: Would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs, or could you walk us towards them and stay hidden?

MATT: “I don't want to stay here.”

LAURA: Then you come with us, and then you stay very, very hidden.

MATT: “I can do that. I can definitely do that.”

TALIESIN: When it's time, he can hide with the bear. Then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker, or most of a mapmaker.

SAM: We'll be fine. Let's go.

MATT: “All right.”

LIAM: While all of that happened, for the last ten minutes, can I stealth away for a little bit?

MATT: Sure. Roll a stealth check.

LIAM: 31.

MATT: Okay. Based on passive perception, nobody notices your exit.

LIAM: I don't want to go that far, I want to go so I can still hear all this bullshit behind me, and find a quiet spot… I know you can hear me. I'm going to need… I'm going to need more than nightmares. A deal has been struck, and I will honor it. I need to understand what this is. Any time.

MATT: In that moment, the white snow suddenly flashes to dark, and it's like you were struck blind. You gasp instinctually as your vision goes dark, nothing, and you see come from the shadow, another flash, another vision. It's of Vasselheim. Another flash. You look out and you can see there's one large, darkened structure that you have not visited but passed by on the southeastern side of Vasselheim.

TALIESIN: Yeah! Temple! Temple of the Raven Queen.

MATT: The actual name of this, and you've heard it in passing before, when you were given your initial pass over of the… I'm trying to find the specific name here so I don't mess it up. It's in here somewhere. You see this dark, obsidian structure that is ridged, almost like an even rib cage along each side. It is ominous, and it stuck out in the middle of the city because, amongst the rest of the jovial atmosphere, it loomed over the Amaranthine Oubliette. But this was the central temple to the Raven Queen. You then flash once again, in a long chamber, and you see veils, dark veils passing by, one after another, after another. Another flash forward, and you see a chamber with dark brown, smooth floors. You see gold trim along large pillars that reach up to a dome-type stained glass ceiling of amber colors and white, and in the center of this chamber you see what appears to be a pool of still, crimson liquid. You see the crimson liquid shift, and a form rises up out of it. An arm rises up and beckons a finger. Your vision goes to black, and you're back in the forest.

LIAM: Fuck. Not exactly what I was talking about. At some point, a little bit of clarification. Congratulations, you're creepy as fuck. We'll work it out. I head back to the group.

SAM: Good talk.

MATT: As you guys gather yourselves, your new companion, and start heading in the direction that he ushered you within the Frostweald, towards where supposedly these orcs have holed up and made their camp, you know that the good news is, you probably have the element of surprise in this, but you're not entirely sure what it is you're in for when you get there. That's where I'll end today's session.

(groaning)

LAURA: That was a lot of sidetracks on this particular adventure.

MATT: That's all right. Sidetracks make it fun.

TALIESIN: Nothing wrong with sidetrack.

LIAM: Heebie-jeebies.

LAURA: Oh, man, she's creepy!

ASHLEY: Creepy as fuck!

LAURA: Creepy as fuck!

SAM: Hey, Pike, good job tonight, lady!

TRAVIS: Hey, Pikey!

SAM: You brought a guy back to life!

LAURA: 19 strength, say what!

SAM: You're super strong!

ASHLEY: I'm a tank.

TRAVIS: Tank up in this motherfucker.

LIAM: (bang! bang! bang!)

ASHLEY: It feels so good to be back.

MATT: I know. Come back to us soon! Physically!

LAURA: Yes, please!

ASHLEY: Yes, very soon! A few more weeks, a few more weeks.

TRAVIS: She's coming, she's coming.

LIAM: We need our Pike.

MATT: All right, guys. We'll pick this up next Thursday! Thank you for coming and watching us play around, make believe on the Internet.

SAM: Is next week any– It's not our 50th episode?

LIAM: It's our 49th!

LAURA: Next week is our 49th, two weeks from now is our 50th.

MATT: 21st is our 50th episode.

SAM: Last time in our 40s.

MARISHA: Got to enjoy it now.

TRAVIS: And don't miss the 50th.

MATT: Don't miss the 50th, it's going to be fun.

LAURA: May be a couple surprises in store.

MATT: We'll see.

TRAVIS: Nothing. Just us.

MATT: I don't know where we'll be in the story, because that's definitely based on whatever you guys do. But we'll have some fun things here.

LIAM: Shopping episode.

MATT: Yep. But yeah, thank you guys so much! See you next Thursday. Those of you in Pittsburgh, we'll see you this weekend. Is it Thursday yet?
